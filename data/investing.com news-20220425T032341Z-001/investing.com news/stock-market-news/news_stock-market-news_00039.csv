Argentine 5-year credit default swaps (CDS) were quoted by IHS Markit at 2,669 basis points (bps), up 319 bps from Friday's closing level of 2,350 bps. Markit calculations, based on Friday's closing prices, estimate a 77% probability of a sovereign default within the next five years.
Fernandez, the favourite to win the October elections, said he would seek to renegotiate the repayment terms, according to an interview published on Sunday by the newspaper Clarin.
Argentina signed a stand-by agreement with the IMF in mid-2018 for $57 billion. That deal was overseen by President Mauricio Macri, who was beaten by Fernandez in primary elections on August 11."

The nation’s biggest lenders make up about 23% of the S&P/TSX Composite Index and on an average total return basis, the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index has been a laggard compared with Canada’s main stock stock gauge this year -- which has gained about 15% including dividends.
“We are trimming our forecasts for the second time in the last month,” Eight Capital analyst Steve Theriault said in an Aug. 14 report, citing weak capital market trends and margin pressure.
Banks are expected to report on average a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share compared with the prior year, according analysts at firms including Eight Capital and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Royal Bank of Canada kicks off the reporting season on Wednesday and CIBC the following day.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analyst Ebrahim Poonawala was also cautious. “We find it hard to imagine that the operating outlook for the banks will be immune to a worsening macro backdrop,” he said. “We are cautious on the group as the risk/reward equation is not stacking up attractively.”
On the economic data front, inflation numbers are due this week, along with retail, wholesale and manufacturing sales.
Global macroeconomic turmoil, geopolitical unrest and a domestic political scandal took center stage last week, in a month that’s typically quiet for Canada as investors escape to cottage getaways, camping weekends and long road trips.

2,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>","Stimulus optimism boosts stocks, eases pressure on bonds","By Tom Wilson and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets rose on Monday on signs that major economies would look to prop up stalling growth with fresh stimulus measures, easing pressure on bonds and dampening demand for perceived safe-havens such as gold. 
Hopes of government action to stave off fears of recession - triggered by an inversion in the U.S. bond yield curve - grew as China's central bank unveiled interest rate reforms expected to lower corporate borrowing costs.
The prospect of Germany's coalition government ditching its balanced budget rule to take on new debt and launch stimulus steps also helped the mood, after boosting Wall Street shares on Friday.
Berlin could make available up to 50 billion euros ($55 billion) of extra spending, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Sunday, adding that Germany has the fiscal strength to counter any future economic crisis ""with full force"".
MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which follows shares in 47 countries, gained 0.4%, powered by a 1% gain for the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX). Bourses in London (FTSE), Frankfurt and Paris all registered gains of more than 1%.
The optimism was set to spread to Wall Street, too, where futures gauges   were pointing to gains of between 0.9%-1%.
Earlier in the day, the People's Bank of China's interest rate reforms - which it is said would help steer borrowing costs lower for companies and support a slowing economy - helped stocks in Shanghai (SSEC) rise 2.1%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) gained 1.1%.
Yet even as signs that major economies would act to support growth emboldened investors, some market players cautioned that the boost to markets from expectations of stimulus was fragile. 
""You have just got a little bit of portfolio readjustment, a resetting of expectations. The big question is whether it can last,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. ""Talking about fiscal stimulus in Germany is one thing, doing it is something else.""
As investors tiptoed back to riskier assets, gold  fell as much as 1% to $1,496.70 per ounce, with U.S. futures for the precious metal  also down. 
The Japanese yen, another safe haven that benefits in times of stress, lost 0.2% to last trade at 106.57 to the dollar.
The dollar index <.DXY,>, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, was marginally higher in Europe at 98.179, close to a two-week high reached on Friday.

Investors are focused on the annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak at the symposium on Friday. 
Analysts think Powell's remarks will be aimed at reassuring nervous markets that the Fed will keep its easing stance.
""Powell's speech will set the stage for, at the minimum, a 25 basis points rate cut at the September meeting, stressing that quantitative tightening is over and stressing that the committee's bias is now back in accommodation mode,"" said Elsa Lignos, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets. 
The shift toward appetite for riskier assets played out in bond markets, too. 
Benchmark government debt in the euro zone rose off record lows, with Germany's 10-year bond yield steady at -0.69% (DE10YT=RR). Its 30-year bond yields also gained.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) stood at 1.6097%, having pulled away from a three-year trough marked last week as fears of a global slowdown panicked markets.
In commodity markets, crude oil prices rose after an attack on a Saudi oil facility by Yemeni separatists on Saturday, with traders also looking for signs that Sino-U.S. trade tensions could ease.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was 0.3% higher, at $58.81 a barrel.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were up 0.5%, at $55.12 a barrel.

Trump said Cook ""made a good case"" that tariffs could hurt Apple, given that Samsung's products would not be subject to those same tariffs. Tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, including consumer electronics, are scheduled to go into effect in two stages on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15.
By contrast, the United States and South Korea struck a trade agreement last September.
""I thought he made a very compelling argument, so I'm thinking about it,"" Trump said of Cook, speaking with reporters at a New Jersey airport.
U.S. stock futures rose upon opening on Sunday after Trump's comments. In addition to his comments on Apple, Trump said on Twitter earlier in the day that his administration was ""doing very well with China.""
Apple's MacBook laptops and iPhones would not face the additional tariffs until Dec. 15, but some of the company's other products, including its AirPods, Apple Watch and HomePod, would be subject to the levies on Sept. 1.
Apple was not immediately available for comment outside normal business hours.

The blue-chip Dow futures gained 247 points, or 0.9% by 06:49 AM ET (10:49 GMT), S&P 500 futures rose 27 points, or 0.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 81 points, or 1.08%.
The gains came after Wall Street ended last week in a more upbeat mood, buoyed by a rebound in bond yields, which eased fears over the economic outlook.
But investors were continuing to keep a wary eye on economic data and developments in the Sino-U.S. trade war.
On Sunday, President Donald Trump dismissed concerns over the possibility of a U.S. recession.
“I don’t think we’re having a recession,” Trump said. “We’re doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut and they’re loaded up with money.”
His comments came after the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index hit its lowest level in seven months on Friday.
Trump was less optimistic than his aides on striking a trade deal with China, saying that while he believed China was ready to come to an agreement, ""I'm not ready to make a deal yet.""
He hinted that the White House would like to see Beijing resolve ongoing protests in Hong Kong first.
Markets were also awaiting a decision expected to arrive later Monday over whether the government will allow Huawei Technologies to buy supplies from U.S. firms.
Several media outlets reported that the U.S. Commerce Department will grant a “temporary general license” that will allow business to continue for another 90 days. However, Trump appeared to contradict that by saying that he didn't want U.S. companies to deal with Huawei at all, citing national security concerns.
On a light day for economic data, investors were looking ahead to earnings reports from   Estee Lauder   (NYSE:EL), the parent company for MAC, Clinique, Bobbi Brown, Smashbox and other premium cosmetics brands along with Chinese search engine giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU).
Elsewhere, the general rise in risk appetite helped U.S. crude oil futures to a 0.8% rise, while gold futures retreated 0.9%. "
5,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 07:04AM ET</span>","Euro zone bond yields rise from record lows, 30-year leads way","By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Long-dated bond yields in the euro zone shot higher on Monday on the back of a calmer tone in world markets and increased expectations for fiscal stimulus in Germany.
Germany has the fiscal strength to counter any future economic crisis ""with full force"", Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Sunday, suggesting Berlin could provide up to 50 billion euros ($55 billion) of extra spending.
That followed a report on Friday that Germany was prepared to ditch its balanced budget rule and take on new debt to counter a possible recession, pushing bond yields higher.
Firmer sentiment in equity markets and a report that the U.S. Treasury is considering issuing 50 or 100-year bonds also provided an opportunity for bond investors to take profits on recent hefty price gains, analysts said. 
Thirty-year bond yields across the single currency bloc were up 9-10 basis points on the day. Germany's 30-year bond yield was on track for its biggest one-day jump since 2017, rising to -0.11% (DE30YT=RR). 
Germany's 10-year bond yield was up 4 bps at -0.63% (DE10YT=RR), off record lows around -0.73% hit last week.
""The fiscal spending debate is taking shape so we have an expectation that a swing in supply may come about although we think that's unlikely,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) rates strategist Rainer Guntermann. 
""There's also a debate about 50-year bond issuance in the U.S., which we've had before, adding to this cocktail is that the market is consolidating after last week."" 
Hopes of fresh stimulus measures from major economies have helped soothe global recessionary fears. World stock markets were also cheered by a decision from China's central bank to alter the way it sets a key interest rate benchmark, a move seen by analysts as reducing borrowing costs for companies.
Japanese bond yields nudged away from three-year lows and U.S. Treasury yields rose 5-13 bps. 
In Italy unease was also creeping in as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte gets ready to address the Senate on Tuesday on a government crisis.
Italy's 10-year bond yield was up 10 bps on the day at 1.50% (IT10YT=RR). 
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement said on Sunday that Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League, was no longer a credible partner, apparently closing the door on any possibility of resurrecting the ruling coalition.
The League has put forward a motion of no confidence in the government, but 5-Star and the opposition Democratic Party refused to debate it and are discussing forming a coalition among themselves.
""Under the earliest scenario, elections can only happen in November,"" said Pooja Kumra, European rates strategist at TD Securities. ""Markets also expect an easing package from ECB next month so any fall in (Italian) BTPs could be a buying opportunity.""

6,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 06:55AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Says Stocks Can Reach New Highs Despite Yield Inversion,"(Bloomberg) -- Don’t fret too much about the yield curve inversion, says JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. Stocks can still climb to new records.
Equities around the world plunged last week after the key U.S. 2-year and 10-year yield curve briefly flipped for the first time since 2007, spurring fears of an economic downturn. But this correction is likely to be short-lived and U.S. stocks will recover as soon as early September, say JPMorgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka, as stimulus from major central banks outweighs worries about a slowdown.
Even if the well-known harbinger of recession proves correct, JPMorgan says investors should still have time to reap further gains before the mood sours, since past yield curve inversions have preceded economic downturns by as long as 17 months on average and stock market peaks by about 11 months. The return in equities averaged about 10% in the 12 months following a flat yield curve, according to JPMorgan.
“We continue to think that, post the August correction, equities will make new all-time highs into the first half of next year,” JPMorgan strategists, including Matejka, write in a note. “Having said that, this development nevertheless increases the chances of a potential peak of the market for this cycle in summer 2020, as we previously outlined in our work.”
The analysts also point out that in the past, the curve inversion was a sign of real policy rates becoming too high, of a deteriorating labor market and tighter lending conditions. However, the current situation is the opposite, with real rates barely exceeding zero.
“The curve inversion might be more an indicator of extreme market nervousness at present, of increasing central banks action, skewed bond ownership, and of global search for yield, rather than a sure sign that the U.S. is about to enter a recession,” according to the JPMorgan strategists."

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets opened broadly higher on Monday, albeit supported by little other than weekend words from President Donald Trump and his staff on the trade war with China, and from German government officials hinting at possible fiscal stimulus measures for the euro zone’s largest economy.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro STOXX 600 was up 0.5% at 371.53, while the U.K. FTSE 100 and the German DAX were both up 0.7%. 
The Italian FTSE MIB was the top performer of the morning on hopes that a new government can be cobbled together to pass a budget for next year without the need for new elections.
However, Helen Thomas, CEO of the consultancy Blonde Money in Oxford, noted that the political momentum remains with the right-wing Lega Party of Matteo Salvini, and that a new government led by it remains the likeliest outcome.
“If a discredited cobbled-together coalition or a bunch of technocrats has to get Italy through its Budget process, anti-establishment sentiment will only rise,” Thomas said in a morning brief.
All other things being equal, that would mean that a relief rally for Italian stocks could be short-lived, given that Italy's debt dispute with the EU - a key weakness in the euro zone's economic and political architecture - would be only deferred rather than settled. However, there’s an upside to buying even a few months, since that could be all Italy needs for the broader budgetary picture in Europe to become more accommodating.
Over the weekend, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz dropped hints about Berlin loosening the purse strings to support an economy that is slowing sharply under the effects of the U.S.-China trade war. 
Frederik Ducrozet, a strategist with Pictet Asset Management, noted that Scholz’s comments were deliberately vague “but anyway, the fiscal genie is out of the bottle and the markets are listening,” he said via Twitter.

BRISTOL, Pa. (Reuters) - When Europe's tariffs on U.S. whiskey hit in June 2018, craft distillery Mountain Laurel Spirits LLC lost 10% of its sales overnight as its European distributor simply stopped buying its award-winning Dad's Hat Pennsylvania Rye Whiskey. 
Foreign governments subject to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs have targeted American distilleries and their bourbon and rye whiskeys for retaliation. The industry fears new tariffs under consideration by the U.S. government could result in even higher tariffs on their products in Europe.
""We went from a marginally profitable business to breaking even,"" Mountain Laurel's owner and chemical engineer-turned-distiller, Herman Mihalich, said while testing his latest batch of rye whiskey in the sleepy hamlet of Bristol in southeast Pennsylvania.
U.S. whiskey exporters are struggling to recoup lost sales after shipments to Europe plummeted 21% between June 2018 and 2019, according to data from the Distilled Spirits Council, a U.S. industry group. 
In the 12 months before the tariffs hit, the United States exported $757 million of rye and bourbon. From July 2018 to June 2019 exports were $597 million. Exports are a sizeable chunk of sales the U.S. whiskey industry, which generated $3.6 billion in revenue in 2018.
The Distilled Spirits Council said that 63% of U.S. whiskey exports have faced retaliatory tariffs from the European Union, China, Turkey, Canada and Mexico. The EU currently levies 25% tariffs on U.S. whiskey.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office is preparing to slap tariffs of up to 100% on $1.8 billion worth of European spirits and wine in response to illegal European aid to planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR), the most recent development in a 15-year-long trade dispute between Europe and the United States. 
""American whiskeys have become collateral damage,"" said Chris Swonger, chief executive of the Distilled Spirits Council at an Aug. 6 hearing with the U.S. Trade Representative. He urged Washington not to introduce the new tariffs because the industry fears Europe will introduce even more tariffs in retaliation.
The group said that at least 11,200 to 78,600 jobs could be lost in the beverage, alcohol and hospitality sectors, which currently employ 2.4 million Americans, if the EU-U.S.-conflict worsened.
WHISKEY BOOM ENDING 
The tariff war is capping a boom for U.S whiskey despite a surge in global demand for traditionally made spirits and cocktails. The Kentucky Distillers Association said that the production of Kentucky bourbon, a popular variety of U.S. whiskey, in 2018 reached its highest level - 1.7 million barrels - since 1972.
At the Aug. 6 hearing, Swonger testified that many of the Distilled Spirits Council's members, including exporting businesses from 45 U.S. states, have halted hiring and expansion plans and seen margins take a hit because of the tariffs.
One of them is Scott Harris of Catoctin Creek Distilling Co in Virginia, who has thousands of unfilled rye bottles. Anticipated European demand never materialized because of the EU levies, which have pushed prices too high for most European consumers. 
The company had hoped that Europe could soak up at least a tenth of its sales and had bought a large inventory of European-sized bottles just as the tariffs hit. 
Worse, Harris said he cannot do anything with the 700 ml bottles because the U.S. market mandatory standard is 750 ml bottles.
Catoctin Creek's European sales are today close to zero, and the few bottles it does sell are at a significant loss because the firm does not want to pass on the cost of tariffs to price-sensitive European customers. 
""We had one distributor we signed a deal with. He just stopped returning our phone calls,"" Harris said. ""We've been trying very hard to get into the UK and France, and we can't get any distributor to talk to us right now.""
Several distillers interviewed by Reuters said that prior to the tariffs, Scottish or Irish whiskeys were generally more expensive in Europe, fueling thirst for cheaper U.S. varieties. But when the duties reversed the cost picture, European distributors lost interest in American rye and bourbon.
Getting into the European market was ""low-hanging fruit,"" said Amir Peay, owner of James E. Pepper Distilling Co in Lexington, Kentucky. His company had invested ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" to break into the European market.
""The way the market is now is extremely disappointing,"" Peay said.
In Pennsylvania, Mountain Laurel Spirits has tried to offset sales declines by breaking into new markets in the United States, a far from easy task as each of the 50 U.S. states requires an in-state licensed wholesaler. 
While there are exceptions and there are wholesalers that operate in several states, Mihalich complained that the contracts often have to be drawn up 50 different ways.
Other foreign markets outside of Europe are often hard to break into and often not worth the hefty investment for smaller distillers, several companies said. 
Large spirit producers have also been forced to adjust to the tariffs. Brown–Forman Corp (N:BFb), maker of the world's most popular U.S.-made whiskey, Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey, has lost $125 million due to the European tariffs.
Chief Executive Lawson Whiting said in June that the company takes the hit ""quite personal"" since it produces 60% of all U.S. whiskey.

""It is a targeted tariff at Brown-Forman,"" Whiting said.

MORRISTOWN, New Jersey (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said he did not want the United States to do business with China's Huawei even as the administration weighs whether to extend a grace period for the company.
Reuters and other media outlets reported on Friday that the U.S. Commerce Department is expected to extend a reprieve given to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd that permits the Chinese firm to buy supplies from U.S. companies so that it can service existing customers. 
The ""temporary general license"" will be extended for Huawei for 90 days, Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the situation.
On Sunday, Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One in New Jersey that he did not want to do business with Huawei for national security reasons.
""At this moment it looks much more like we're not going to do business,"" Trump said. ""I don't want to do business at all because it is a national security threat and I really believe that the media has covered it a little bit differently than that.""
He said there were small parts of Huawei's business that could be exempted from a broader ban, but that it would be ""very complicated."" He did not say whether his administration would extend the ""temporary general license.""
Speaking earlier on Sunday, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow said the Commerce department would extend the Huawei licensing process for three months as a gesture of ""good faith"" amid broader trade negotiations with China.

""We're giving a break to our own companies for three months,"" Kudlow said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"".

BERLIN (Reuters) - Online fashion retailer Zalando (DE:ZALG) has launched a pilot to deliver orders placed by customers in Paris on the website of Adidas (DE:ADSGn) as it extends moves to allow brands to use the logistics network it has built for its own ecommerce business.
The pilot is the first time the German firm is delivering goods not ordered on its own site and marks an expansion of its platform strategy under which it charges brands a commission to list on its website rather than selling the products itself.
""It is a win-win situation for us,"" Jan Bartels, Zalando senior vice president for customer fulfillment, told Reuters. ""It increases the density of deliveries if you combine and bundle volumes from different channels.""
Under the pilot, Adidas is storing sneakers at a Zalando warehouse close to Paris and using the Zalando network to deliver orders placed on its site the same or next day.
The scheme comes as Adidas is rapidly expanding ecommerce, seeking to double online sales in two years to 4 billion euros ($4.44 billion) by 2020.
Zalando is not worried that helping brands like Adidas with their own ecommerce operations will draw customers away from its site because it believes most shoppers want to buy a range of brands, Bartels said.
""We are not afraid of cannibalisation. We have a very strong proposition in multibrand retailing,"" he said. ""We don't want to become a third party logistics provider. We are still a fashion platform.""
Zalando, Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer, is working to counter a squeeze on profitability as it has invested heavily in logistics to speed delivery as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other players have expanded rapidly in online fashion.
It forecasts that its margins should improve as its ""partner program"" expands because the sales commission business, and providing logistics and advertising services, is more profitable than its core online retailing operations.
Bartels said offering same-day delivery should increase how often Adidas customers order and push down return rates, a major issue for Zalando given that half of orders are sent back.

16,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2019 01:36AM ET</span>",Last orders: Rise of closing auctions stirs worries in European stock markets,"By Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - The final five minutes of trading have become the busiest time of day for stock market traders in Europe.
Aside from an initial burst of activity after the open in the morning followed by a brief flurry when Wall Street opens, a growing portion of the daily equity volumes is now concentrated into the five-minute closing auctions at the end of the day.
The growing popularity of passive and index-tracking funds and tougher regulations are driving the shift, which is draining liquidity in the $11.1 trillion market and raising concerns about big price swings and possible disruption to price discovery.
The trend is also fracturing the industry as rivals look to take a slice of the action by launching their own post-close trading products. If sustained, it will likely stir the debate about whether there is even a need in the long term for an elongated trading day.
Products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and hedge funds typically use end-of-day prices set during the closing auctions for their daily pricing.
Equity ETFs in Europe have ballooned in recent years and are now worth about 500 billion euro ($558 billion). That's up more than 8% in the first half of the year and a whopping 38% from January 2017, according to Morningstar data.
With their rise, the five-minute window between 1530 and 1535 GMT each day is capturing a bigger portion of daily volume, which averaged about 70 billion euros in June.
Closing auctions across Europe's major bourses have on average accounted for 20% of daily average volumes in the first half of this year, and hit their highest on record of 23% in June, according to Rosenblatt Securities which tracks volumes.
That's up from just 13% three years ago. There is a similar trend in the United States, where activity is also clustering in the auctions.
Activity typically spikes in the final month of each quarter, as funds scramble to participate in the auctions that set the value of their investments for the quarter.
This year though, there has been a pronounced and steady rise each month as banks, brokers and asset managers find the auctions provide the deepest pool of liquidity.
""The rest of the day is meaningless and you can't see flow,"" said Andrea Vismara, chief executive office at Italian boutique investment bank Equita.
The jump has been particularly noticeable this year as overall trading volumes have slowed amid tighter regulation and rising costs and as investors have in general shunned equities even as prices have soared.
Onerous paperwork imposed by the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), which came into force early last year, has also helped drive the shift. The reporting process for regulatory purposes is simpler if trading is executed at the closing auction.
The trend has drawn the scrutiny of the French market regulator Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF), which warned last month that lower liquidity may distort price-setting mechanisms and increase price swings.
Closing auctions on Euronext's (PA:ENX) Paris blue-chip CAC 40 stock index (FCHI) account for as much as 40% of volume, it found.
""The associated risks are a deterioration in price formation and liquidity during trading sessions, not to mention the operational vulnerabilities at the end of the day given the volumes concentrated in the closing auction,"" the watchdog said in its report.
LIQUIDITY BEGETS LIQUIDITY
While it's not clear if it has yet disrupted price formation, interviews with a dozen traders and senior executives at international banks, brokerages, wealth managers and exchanges show that the trend is upending how they do business.
For a start, liquidity begets liquidity - as more traffic goes through the closing auction, it has a self-amplifying effect.
""In many cases, volumes in the closing auctions are so significant they cannot be ignored,"" said Derek McCole, head of equity dealing for EMEA at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
He has adjusted to the new norm. He tends to place a percentage of an order at the settlement price in the closing auction and then opportunistically trade the rest of the order if a certain price is hit.
But some executives say it is getting more difficult to do big block trades during the day, forcing many to save large transactions until the end of the day. That leads to even lower liquidity during the remaining 8-1/2 hours.
""The market opens, nothing happens and then the U.S. come in. It's busy for the first hour and then it quietens down,"" said a senior executive at a global bank.
""People are struggling to get orders done. If people are looking for blocks, they wait until the closing auction.""
RARE SOURCE OF REVENUE
For exchange operators like Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) and the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), the rise of closing auctions provides a rare and much-needed source of revenue.
The exchanges often charge higher fees to transact in the closing auction compared with intraday levels. Each bourse has a different fee structure so it's hard to pinpoint an exact premium.
But signs have emerged that the financial industry is divided over the trend, with CBOE Europe and  Aquis Exchange  (L:AQX) launching rival platforms to break the exchanges' monopoly.
CBOE says it will not charge customers until the end of the year to use its 3C product, while Aquis charges a fixed 10,000 pound subscription.
Aquis Chief Executive Alasdair Haynes said he wants his company's Market at Close product to provide competition to the exchanges. He estimates the fees for closing auctions are costing the industry an extra 75-100 million pounds each year.
The product got UK regulatory approval a few years ago, but it has only seen volume pick up in recent weeks, a spokeswoman said.
That rise in interest has come as banks aim to slash costs due to razor-thin margins, which have been eroded by the burden of extra regulation and lower volumes.
""There is no doubt there is a correlation with banks trying to save money and the interest in our product where there's a serious cost reduction for the banks,"" Haynes said.
But the Aquis and CBOE foray has, in turn, stirred worries about drawing liquidity away from the main exchanges.
""There's a perception that the exchanges exploit their monopoly position for the closing auctions, so the lower fees offered by alternative products may be attractive for brokers,"" said Rosenblatt Securities' market structure analyst for Europe, Anish Puarr.
But ""there may be a danger in fragmenting"" liquidity in the auctions, which provide a vitally important official closing price, he said.
Investors like Equita and Aberdeen are also worried that alternatives could attract volumes away from closing auctions, distorting price creation.
""As these different ways of trading the close appear, that could potentially weaken the existing closing structure if liquidity gravitates away from the primary market onto these other mechanisms,"" said McCole.

Shares of Hong Kong-listed Cathay Pacific fell as the company’s CEO resigned amid controversy surrounding the Hong Kong protest.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.8% by 10:35 PM ET (02:35 GMT). In a blog post published on Sunday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the city should brace itself for an “economic typhoon” caused by the ongoing political unrest and Sino-U.S. trade war.
Cathay Pacific (HK:0293) fell about 1.5% following the announcement that the company’s CEO Rubert Hogg had resigned. Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Paul Loo also stepped down alongside the CEO.
“These have been challenging weeks for the airline and it is right that Paul and I take responsibility as leaders of the company,” Hogg said in a company statement on Friday.
Augustus Tang, a long-time lieutenant with Swire Group, will replace Hogg as Cathay’s CEO. Swire is Cathay’s biggest investor.
The airline has been reportedly targeted by Beijing for failing to rein in staff taking part in the protests that began in early June, even after the airline fired four staff for their involvement in protest-related actions.
“Cathay Pacific’s latest gesture was viewed by many as too little to restore its scarred reputation and the loss of customers,” China’s state-owned media Global Times said after Hogg’s departure.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component rose 1.4% and 1.5% respectively. On Saturday, the People’s Bank of China said it will improve the mechanism used to establish the loan prime rate so it could “use market-based reform methods to help lower real lending rates.”
Tech giant Huawei is back in focus as U.S. President Donald Trump said he does not want to do business with the company ""because it is a national security threat.”

“We’ll see what happens. I’m making a decision tomorrow,” Trump said.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 0.8% higher. The country’s exports fell 1.6% in July from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2019 10:11PM ET</span>","Pimco Income Fund, run by Dan Ivascyn, whipsawed by big bond rally","By Jennifer Ablan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The massive rally in Treasuries has whipsawed the biggest name in the bond world.
Pimco group chief investment officer Dan Ivascyn's Pimco Income Fund, the largest actively managed bond fund with assets of more than $130 billion, is lagging 93 percent of its category so far this year, according to Morningstar data as of Saturday.
Several macro trades have hurt the fund's performance so far this year: its underweight position in Treasuries and corporate credit risk and its heavy exposure to mortgages.
Some $8.4 trillion in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae have been rocked by the swift decline in bond yields on worries that a wave of mortgage refinancing would erode the value of these bonds.
When interest rates fall and homeowners refinance, investors of mortgage-backed securities get back their principal, which they have to reinvest at lower rates. To offset the resulting shortening of their portfolios, they buy noncallable Treasuries. In bond-market parlance, this is called the ""convexity trade.""
The Pimco Income Fund is up 4.68 percent year-to-date, lagging its multi-sector bond category by 3.21 percentage points, Morningstar data show. Moreover, the fund is lagging the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Universal Total Return Index by 4.24 percentage points for the same period, according to Morningstar.
""The primary focus of the Income fund is a sustainable dividend and long-term performance, especially in the more credit sensitive portion of portfolio, so we are willing to be patient in the near-term if we believe that long-term we can protect against permanent capital loss,"" Ivascyn said in emailed comments to Reuters.
Pimco Income has a more flexible mandate of producing a high, consistent return and long-term capital appreciation rather than a benchmark-focused total return strategy of more traditional bond funds. The fund's three-year and five-year annualized returns were 5.43% and 5%, respectively, Morningstar data showed as of Aug. 16. On a 10-year annualized basis, the fund has posted returns of 9.25%, easily surpassing all of its competitors in the category, Morningstar data show.
Corporate credit spreads have been volatile. During the fourth quarter of 2018 when stocks plunged and people feared much higher defaults, corporate credit widened dramatically relative to mortgages. Early this year when investors' views began to improve and central banks became more accommodative, corporate credit spreads tightened significantly as stocks soared.  
But while agency MBS has not performed well lately, Ivascyn called housing-related investments ""more resilient"" than corporate credit.
""We believe that corporate credit is fundamentally weak and could overshoot to the downside if the economy deteriorates,"" he said. ""We also think developed government bond yields are too low and could easily reverse so we are comfortable with low rate exposure."""

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) also said in a report published on Sunday that it planned to hire more analysts, investigators and lawyers to boost its capacity to probe ""and where necessary litigate against, market, corporate and financial sector misconduct"".
The regulator said in that report the number of enforcement investigations it was conducting grew by a fifth over the year to end-June, compared with the previous year, while investigations involving what it called ""the big six"" rose by half.
In an interview with the Australian newspaper on Monday, ASIC Deputy Chair Daniel Crennan said proceedings involving the ""big six"" would be issued before Christmas.
The paper added that the big six referred to the four largest retail lenders Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) plus top investment bank  Macquarie Group  Ltd (AX:MQG) and top financial planner AMP (AX:AMP).
In a separate interview with the Australian Financial Review also published on Monday, Crennan said the regulator had ""a very large number of investigations on foot and there will be cases being issued in coming weeks, which are the result of those investigations"".
Neither newspaper report provided details of the proposed legal action.
Australia's finance sector regulators have faced calls to increase scrutiny of major lenders after an inquiry found widespread cases of knowingly selling investment products to people who could not afford them and taking billions of dollars in customer fees without providing a service.
Last week, ASIC faced additional pressure after losing a court action against Westpac, the No. 2 lender, in which the regulator accused the bank of using overly vague methods to calculate people's ability to pay their mortgage.
In the update, ASIC said its investigations involving wealth management companies grew 216% over the past year, although it did not name the companies it was investigating.
Spokespeople for CBA and Westpac declined to comment, while representatives of AMP, ANZ, NAB and Macquarie were not immediately available for comment."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating a ""cluster"" of lung illnesses that it believes may be linked to e-cigarette use after such cases were reported in 14 states.
The CDC said there was no evidence that an infectious disease was behind the illnesses and that more information was needed to determine whether they were in fact caused by e-cigarette use. 
The CDC is working with health departments in Wisconsin, Illinois, California, Indiana and Minnesota on the investigation. Since June 28, states have reported 94 possible cases of severe lung illness tied to vaping, primarily among teenagers and young adults, according to a CDC statement on Saturday. Of those cases, 30 occurred in Wisconsin.
Patients experienced coughing, shortness of breath and fatigue. Some had serious breathing difficulties that required ventilation.
A CDC spokesman was unable to provide additional information on the investigation. Representatives for the state health departments did not respond to inquiries.
Other states, including New York and New Jersey, have also issued health advisories regarding vaping-linked lung illnesses.
The CDC did not link the illnesses to any specific product. In the United States, Juul Labs, in which  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO) has a 35% stake, is the dominant e-cigarette maker.
""Like any health-related events reportedly associated with the use of vapor products, we are monitoring these reports,"" Juul Labs said on Sunday in a statement emailed to Reuters.
""These reports reaffirm the need to keep all tobacco and nicotine products out of the hands of youth through significant regulation on access and enforcement. We also must ensure illegal products, such as counterfeit, copycat, and those that deliver controlled substances, stay out of the market and away from youth.""
Juul also noted that, according to some media reports, several incidences of lung illness linked to vaping have involved THC, found in marijuana, ""a Schedule 1, controlled substance that we do not sell,"" the company said.

E-cigarettes are generally thought to be safer than traditional cigarettes, which kill up to half of all lifetime users, according to the World Health Organization. But the long-term health effects of the nicotine devices remain largely unknown. In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began an investigation into seizures among e-cigarette users.

Novartis announced the stock sale by an executive member of the board of directors or a member of the executive committee in a Swiss stock exchange filing dated July 19. The sale was first reported by Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung on Sunday.
A Novartis spokesman told Reuters, ""As is usual in such cases, the transaction was thoroughly checked beforehand and then approved accordingly. The person in question was not in possession of relevant material information.""
The sale was made after the company had informed the FDA about the data manipulation but before the FDA announced it publically on Aug 6.
Shares in Novartis fell almost 3 percent the day after the FDA announcement.
The FDA said this month that Novartis notified regulators in June - more than a month after Zolgensma had been approved - that some of the early testing data had been manipulated.
The company had been aware of the problems for as long as two months before the drug's U.S. approval, the FDA said, and Novartis could face criminal or civil penalties.
Novartis said this month that it learned of allegations of data manipulation in mid-March and finished a preliminary investigation into the allegations in early May, confirming data discrepancies and raising data integrity concerns.
The data was used to illustrate comparability between an early version of Zolgensma and the later version of the treatment, which was manufactured using a different process.
The FDA said it does not believe that the manipulation impacts the safety or testing surrounding the version of the drug, which treats spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the leading genetic cause of death in infants."

PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (Reuters) - Italian premium sports car maker  Ferrari  NV (MI:RACE) will expand sales of easier-driving grand touring cars, but will not try to chase rival Porsche's annual sales volume, Ferrari Chairman John Elkann told an audience of classic car enthusiasts gathered at this storied golf resort on the Pacific coast.
Elkann also reiterated that  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), of which he is chairman, remains open to opportunities to combine with other automakers, but is positioned to remain independent. Fiat Chrysler in May proposed a merger with French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), but the deal fell apart after the French government intervened and Elkann withdrew the proposed merger. 
Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Mike Manley sent the same message to Renault and other would-be partners earlier this month.
Elkann visited Pebble Beach during the annual Concours d'Elegance, during which wealthy collectors bring some of the world's rarest vintage automobiles to be admired -- and sold -- and premium manufacturers showcase exotic new models.
Ferrari is best known for flashy, high performance sports cars. Among fans of vintage Ferraris, more understated GT, or grand touring, cars from the 1960s, some with seating for four people, are among the most popular models on auction blocks and at enthusiast events. GT cars were designed to be comfortable on longer road trips. 
Elkann hinted Ferrari will unveil a new GT type car in November. Ferrari has said previously that about 40% of its total sales could come from GT cars by 2022, up from 32% now. 
Ferrari has outlined plans to expand revenue to 5 billion euros ($5.54 billion) by 2022 from 3.4 billion euros in 2017. The company has said it plans to add a model called the Purosangue to compete with a growing stable of sport utility vehicles wearing premium sports car brands, such as the Lamborghini Urus.
Rival Porsche AG, a unit of Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), has expanded its sales to more than 250,000 sports cars and sport utility vehicles annually. Elkann said Ferrari is not aiming for Porsche's level of sales.

26,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2019 02:09AM ET</span>","Alibaba and the $15 billion question: Amid Hong Kong's protests, when to list?","By Jennifer Hughes and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's political unrest is posing a dilemma for  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) on the timing of its planned $15 billion listing in the city, with sources saying China's biggest e-commerce company is now considering several timetables.
New York-listed Alibaba was most likely to launch the offer - potentially the world's biggest of the year - as early as the third quarter, sources have said, and late August, after its first-quarter earnings, was widely viewed as the most likely window.
In preparation for the giant offer, bankers advising other large listings in Hong Kong have been careful to avoid planning their launches around that period, fearing that a clash of timing would crowd out their offerings.
But not a word was mentioned by Alibaba on the Hong Kong listing when it released estimate-beating earnings on Thursday nor did the offer come up in the hour-long discussion with analysts after the results.
Two sources involved in the deal and one other briefed on Alibaba's discussions described the company's thinking on the deal as ""fluid"" and said Alibaba was considering several timetables.
Alibaba declined to comment.
The Hong Kong listing deal was estimated at up to $20 billion, but is more likely, according to sources close to the deal, to raise between $10-$15 billion.
The listing was always expected to be a complex affair because of China's tight control of cross-border share trading, but Hong Kong's unrest has taken the complexity several notches higher.
More than 10 weeks of confrontations between police and pro-democracy protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and presented President Xi Jinping with his biggest popular challenge since taking power in 2012.
Tear gas has been used frequently by police while more than 700 people have been arrested.
This week protesters effectively closed the city's airport on two successive days, disrupting tens of thousands of travelers and posing a practical problem to any company considering launching a deal roadshow in Hong Kong.
Under the circumstances, when Alibaba lists becomes crucial as it sends a signal to the rest of the world on the state of Hong Kong as a business and financial center and provides a window into China's reading of the situation.
""How do you think Beijing feels about giving Hong Kong a $15 billion gift like this, right now?"" asked one capital markets professional not involved in the Alibaba deal.
MARKET HOPES
A listing by Alibaba is a big deal for Hong Kong, which loosened its rules last year specifically to lure overseas-listed Chinese tech giants to list closer to home.
Alibaba would be the first to test the new system.
Asked this week whether Hong Kong's turmoil would affect its listing, Hong Kong stock exchange chief executive Charles Li avoided directly acknowledging the company's application, which is still technically confidential.
But Li added: ""I am confident that companies like that ultimately will find a home here, because this is home and I think they will come. I don’t know when though.""
Alibaba's Hong Kong listing is also sensitive for China, which has been working to give mainland investors a bigger role in funding the country's fast-growing tech sector.
Officials are conscious that capital controls and the U.S. listing preference of most of China's first-generation tech giants mean that international shareholders have profited far more from their success than local investors.
Mainland investors can buy Hong Kong shares through the so-called Stock Connect, which allows investors in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong to trade shares listed on each others' exchanges.
But the inclusion of Alibaba's Hong Kong shares in the Stock Connect is not guaranteed because the scheme does not yet allow mainland buying of companies which have weighted their voting rights in favor of founders, such as smartphone maker  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) and  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690), the online food delivery-to-ticketing firm. Both took advantage last year of another Hong Kong rule change to float in Hong Kong with weighted voting rights structures.
While Alibaba has a single class of shares with equal votes, its governance is not considered standard since its board is controlled by a self-selecting group of company insiders.
Chinese regulators have said they will allow local investors to trade companies with weighted voting rights, but have not yet set a date for doing so.
TECHNICAL HURDLE
Alibaba's deal must also overcome one other technical hurdle: it must gain the approval of the city's listing committee, a 27-strong independent group of industry professionals whose consent is needed for all first-time share sales.
The company has been in discussions with the committee but has not yet appeared before the group at one of its regular Thursday hearings for formal approval, according to three sources.
So far only  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and CICC, the Chinese investment bank, have been mandated for the mega-listing, sources said, although several other banks are jockeying for a role on the deal, they added.
All are expected to be urging caution on the listing given the size of the deal and the political and market considerations.
One senior banker not involved said it made no sense to move too quickly.
“Why would Alibaba rush to kick it off?” he asked."
27,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2019 07:06PM ET</span>",Last orders: Rise of closing auctions stirs worries in European stock markets,"By Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - The final five minutes of trading have become the busiest time of day for stock market traders in Europe.
Aside from an initial burst of activity after the open in the morning followed by a brief flurry when Wall Street opens, a growing portion of the daily equity volumes is now concentrated into the five-minute closing auctions at the end of the day.
The growing popularity of passive and index-tracking funds and tougher regulations are driving the shift, which is draining liquidity in the $11.1 trillion market and raising concerns about big price swings and possible disruption to price discovery.
The trend is also fracturing the industry as rivals look to take a slice of the action by launching their own post-close trading products. If sustained, it will likely stir the debate about whether there is even a need in the long term for an elongated trading day.
Products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and hedge funds typically use end-of-day prices set during the closing auctions for their daily pricing.
Equity ETFs in Europe have ballooned in recent years and are now worth about 500 billion euro ($558 billion). That's up more than 8% in the first half of the year and a whopping 38% from January 2017, according to Morningstar data.
With their rise, the five-minute window between 1530 and 1535 GMT each day is capturing a bigger portion of daily volume, which averaged about 70 billion euros in June.
Closing auctions across Europe's major bourses have on average accounted for 20% of daily average volumes in the first half of this year, and hit their highest on record of 23% in June, according to Rosenblatt Securities which tracks volumes.
That's up from just 13% three years ago. There is a similar trend in the United States, where activity is also clustering in the auctions.
Activity typically spikes in the final month of each quarter, as funds scramble to participate in the auctions that set the value of their investments for the quarter.
This year though, there has been a pronounced and steady rise each month as banks, brokers and asset managers find the auctions provide the deepest pool of liquidity.
""The rest of the day is meaningless and you can't see flow,"" said Andrea Vismara, chief executive office at Italian boutique investment bank Equita.
The jump has been particularly noticeable this year as overall trading volumes have slowed amid tighter regulation and rising costs and as investors have in general shunned equities even as prices have soared.
Onerous paperwork imposed by the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), which came into force early last year, has also helped drive the shift. The reporting process for regulatory purposes is simpler if trading is executed at the closing auction.
The trend has drawn the scrutiny of the French market regulator Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF), which warned last month that lower liquidity may distort price-setting mechanisms and increase price swings.
Closing auctions on Euronext's (PA:ENX) Paris blue-chip CAC 40 stock index (FCHI) account for as much as 40% of volume, it found.
""The associated risks are a deterioration in price formation and liquidity during trading sessions, not to mention the operational vulnerabilities at the end of the day given the volumes concentrated in the closing auction,"" the watchdog said in its report.
GRAPHIC: Closing auction volumes - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/4751/4713/closing%20auctions.png
LIQUIDITY BEGETS LIQUIDITY
While it's not clear if it has yet disrupted price formation, interviews with a dozen traders and senior executives at international banks, brokerages, wealth managers and exchanges show that the trend is upending how they do business.
For a start, liquidity begets liquidity - as more traffic goes through the closing auction, it has a self-amplifying effect.
""In many cases, volumes in the closing auctions are so significant they cannot be ignored,"" said Derek McCole, head of equity dealing for EMEA at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
He has adjusted to the new norm. He tends to place a percentage of an order at the settlement price in the closing auction and then opportunistically trade the rest of the order if a certain price is hit.
But some executives say it is getting more difficult to do big block trades during the day, forcing many to save large transactions until the end of the day. That leads to even lower liquidity during the remaining 8-1/2 hours.
""The market opens, nothing happens and then the U.S. come in. It's busy for the first hour and then it quietens down,"" said a senior executive at a global bank.
""People are struggling to get orders done. If people are looking for blocks, they wait until the closing auction.""
RARE SOURCE OF REVENUE
For exchange operators like Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) and the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), the rise of closing auctions provides a rare and much-needed source of revenue.
The exchanges often charge higher fees to transact in the closing auction compared with intraday levels. Each bourse has a different fee structure so it's hard to pinpoint an exact premium.
But signs have emerged that the financial industry is divided over the trend, with CBOE Europe and  Aquis Exchange  (L:AQX) launching rival platforms to break the exchanges' monopoly.
CBOE says it will not charge customers until the end of the year to use its 3C product, while Aquis charges a fixed 10,000 pound subscription.
Aquis Chief Executive Alasdair Haynes said he wants his company's Market at Close product to provide competition to the exchanges. He estimates the fees for closing auctions are costing the industry an extra 75-100 million pounds each year.
The product got UK regulatory approval a few years ago, but it has only seen volume pick up in recent weeks, a spokeswoman said.
That rise in interest has come as banks aim to slash costs due to razor-thin margins, which have been eroded by the burden of extra regulation and lower volumes.
""There is no doubt there is a correlation with banks trying to save money and the interest in our product where there's a serious cost reduction for the banks,"" Haynes said.
But the Aquis and CBOE foray has, in turn, stirred worries about drawing liquidity away from the main exchanges.
""There's a perception that the exchanges exploit their monopoly position for the closing auctions, so the lower fees offered by alternative products may be attractive for brokers,"" said Rosenblatt Securities' market structure analyst for Europe, Anish Puarr.
But ""there may be a danger in fragmenting"" liquidity in the auctions, which provide a vitally important official closing price, he said.
Investors like Equita and Aberdeen are also worried that alternatives could attract volumes away from closing auctions, distorting price creation.
""As these different ways of trading the close appear, that could potentially weaken the existing closing structure if liquidity gravitates away from the primary market onto these other mechanisms,"" said McCole.

31,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2019 08:35AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
Yield Curve Inversion: This Time It’s Different? 
An important part of the yield curve inverted earlier this week for the first time since 2007, sounding the alarm on a possible recession.
But don’t let the prophetic powers of the bond market, which has flagged every recession over the past 60 years, muddy your judgement, as there are other forces at play causing the yield curve to invert, according to former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen. 
The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell below the rate on 2-year Treasuries, sending global equities tumbling, including the Dow, which fell 800 points on Wednesday.
The yield curve serves as a kind of screen for the economy and when it inverts, bad things tend to happen, but Yellen said, “I would really urge that on this occasion it may be a less good signal.”
Yellen said the inversion can be explained by a number of factors other than market expectations about the future path of interest rates that are pushing down long-term yields.
And she’s not alone.
There is international arbitrage going on in the bond market that is exacerbating the decline in long-term Treasury yields lower,” Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said earlier this week.
With other sovereign bonds like the German bund offering negative yields, investors have little option but to pile into long-term Treasuries, triggering a rally in prices and pushing yields down.
Major foreign holders of Treasuries had $6.636 trillion of U.S. government debt in June, up from $6.539 trillion in May, the latest Treasury data showed.
 Would Southwest Try Another Plane Besides the 737 Max?
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has been an exclusive customer of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 for some 48 years.
Whenever Boeing (NYSE:BA) started thinking about updating the plane, Southwest was always the first carrier it brought into the discussion.
Southwest is betting big on the 737 Max, grounded since two fatal crashes earlier this year, with 280 on order. But it has 34 jets from that order sitting on a Victorville, Calif. airfield after being grounded.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) will keep 41 more, originally scheduled to be delivered this year, until the plane is recertified.
So, would Southwest add another plane to the mix? Maybe. But don't bet on it happening any time soon.
Dominic Gates, the Seattle Times' respected aerospace reporter, noted this past week that Southwest has proposed language in a new union contract that would let the carrier fly ""more narrowbody aircraft types.” The idea would let the carrier fly ""aircraft types that are better suited for some of the markets we serve.”

(That's one explanation. Another might be that it may not be so smart to commit your business to one airplane manufacturer. Southwest and Alaska have done it very successfully, but the 737 Max problems are difficult and causing operational problems.
Either way, the contract proposal set off speculation the carrier might consider the Airbus A220, which is the renamed Bombardier CSseries of small commercial jets. Airbus acquired a 50.1% interest in the business in 2018.
Another possibility is one of the jets made by Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft company that's the third-largest commercial aircraft maker after Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus. More importantly, Boeing is buying an 80% interest in Embraer's commercial airplane business, which will be renamed Boeing Brasil-Commercial.
But you just don't go down to the airplane store and pick up another jet. Getting deals set up to add either plane will take months if not years to negotiate, not to mention training pilots, cabin crews and support teams.
So maybe Southwest will add another jet to its fleet, but only some day. Which may be why Boeing's stock was unaffected by the report on Friday.
CEO Pay Has Soared in the Last 20 Year

When it comes to compensation, the rate of increases in pay at the top level is soaring, but its much more muted for the average worker, according to a study released by the Economic Policy Institute this week.
CEO pay soared 940.3% from 1978 to 2018 when stock option realization was taken into account, the EPI said.
By comparison, the wages for the typical worker grew just 11.9%.
During that time period the S&P rose 706.7%, while pay for very high earners rose 339.2%.
“CEOs are getting more because of their power to set pay, not because they are increasing productivity or possess specific, high-demand skills,” the EPI said.
“This escalation of CEO compensation, and of executive compensation more generally, has fueled the growth of top 1.0% and top 0.1% incomes, leaving less of the fruits of economic growth for ordinary workers and widening the gap between very high earners and the bottom 90%,” it added. “The economy would suffer no harm if CEOs were paid less (or taxed more).”"
32,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2019 12:49AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. set to give Huawei another 90 days to buy from American suppliers - sources,"By Keith Zhai and David Shepardson
SINGAPORE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to extend a reprieve given to Huawei Technologies that permits the Chinese firm to buy supplies from U.S. companies so that it can service existing customers, two sources familiar with the situation said.
The ""temporary general license"" will be extended for Huawei for 90 days, the sources said. 
Commerce initially allowed Huawei to purchase some American-made goods in May shortly after blacklisting the company in a move aimed at minimizing disruption for its customers, many of which operate networks in rural America.
An extension will renew an agreement set to lapse on August 19, continuing the Chinese company's ability to maintain existing telecommunications networks and provide software updates to Huawei handsets.
The situation surrounding the license, which has become a key bargaining chip for the United States in its trade negotiations with China, remains fluid and the decision to continue the Huawei reprieve could change ahead of the Monday deadline, the sources said.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to discuss Huawei in a call this weekend, one of the sources said.
Huawei did not have an immediate comment. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
When the Commerce Department blocked Huawei from buying U.S. goods earlier this year, it was seen as a major escalation in the trade war between the world’s two top economies.
The U.S. government blacklisted Huawei alleging the Chinese company is involved in activities contrary to national security or foreign policy interests.
As an example, the blacklisting order cited a criminal case pending against the company in federal court, over allegations Huawei violated U.S. sanctions against Iran. Huawei has pleaded not guilty in the case.
The order noted that the indictment also accused Huawei of “deceptive and obstructive acts”. 
At the same time the United States says Huawei's smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans, allegations the company has repeatedly denied.
The world's largest telecommunications equipment maker is still prohibited from buying American parts and components to manufacture new products without additional special licenses.
Many Huawei suppliers have requested the special licenses to sell to the firm. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told reporters late last month he had received more than 50 applications, and that he expected to receive more.
Out of $70 billion that Huawei spent buying components in 2018, some $11 billion went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU).
The Commerce Department late on Friday declined to comment, referring to Ross’s comments to CNBC television earlier this week in which he said the existing licenses were in effect until Monday.

Asked if they would be extended he said: “On Monday I'll be happy to update you.”

Judge Dennis Montali of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco turned down requests from two groups of creditors wanting to propose a Chapter 11 exit plan for PG&E, which is facing huge liabilities from California wildfires.
PG&E, a holding company whose main subsidiary is the California utility Pacific Gas and Electric Company, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after severe wildfires in 2017 and 2018 resulted in more than $30 billion in liabilities.
Montali said he believed allowing PG&E to retain the right to lead the process would be a speedier resolution for victims of fires that were caused by equipment belonging to the California utility, according to the court documents.
In its response, PG&E said it planned to file its plan of reorganization by Sept. 9.
""PG&E has made significant progress in further refining a viable, fair, and comprehensive plan of reorganization,"" the company said in a statement.
""We can assure our customers and communities that we are looking at all options in working with the Governor, the CPUC and all stakeholders.""
Hedge funds Knighthead Capital Management and Abrams Capital Management, which are shareholders in PG&E, made a public proposal earlier this month to raise $15 billion in equity to fund a planned reorganization and pledged to purchase a portion of the offered equity if shares are left unsold. 

PG&E bondholders have proposed plans to inject money to help the company emerge from Chapter 11, saying it has been too slow to file its own plan.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Friday defeated an appeal by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in what the online retailer has called a $1.5 billion dispute over its tax treatment of transactions with a Luxembourg subsidiary.
In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle upheld a 2017 ruling by the U.S. Tax Court related to intangible assets that Amazon.com transferred in 2005 and 2006 to the unit, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS.
Intangible assets include such items as customer lists, intellectual property and software. The appeals court rejected a broader definition sought by the IRS that would have boosted Amazon.com's tax bill.
Amazon.com has said it chose Luxembourg for its European headquarters because of its central location, and because it had Europe's lowest value-added tax rate and a relatively low corporate tax rate.
The Seattle-based company had warned it might face ""significant"" new tax liabilities if the Tax Court ruling was reversed, or the IRS approach was applied to other tax years.
Amazon.com's net income totaled $10.07 billion in 2018, and $6.19 billion from January to June of this year.
The U.S. Department of Justice, which represented the IRS, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Amazon.com and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
U.S. companies pay corporate income taxes domestically when they make money outside the country.
But according to the appeals court, tax regulations allow companies such as Amazon.com to transfer intangible assets to foreign affiliates, so long as this is done at arms-length and the units pay their share of intangible development costs.
Circuit Judge Consuelo Callahan said the drafting history of applicable regulations and the Treasury Department's thinking at the time ""strongly favor"" Amazon's argument that ""intangible"" assets were limited to ""independently transferable"" assets.
She rejected the IRS's proposal that they also encompass what she called ""more nebulous"" assets including the value of Amazon.com's goodwill, employees and ""culture of innovation.""
In a footnote, Callahan said Congress changed the definition of intangible property in the 2017 tax overhaul, and that there was ""no doubt"" the IRS position would be correct if the new definition governed the Amazon.com case.
The case is Amazon.com Inc et al v Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 17-72922."
36,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2019 10:01PM ET</span>","U.S. judge urges VW, SEC to resolve civil Dieselgate suit","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in California on Friday urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) to resolve a civil suit stemming from its Dieselgate emissions scandal.
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco, who earlier had questioned why the agency waited two years to sue the automaker, said he was putting the suit on hold until Oct. 4.
""I want you to spend the next month or so seeing if you can resolve this case,"" Breyer said, adding he was temporarily halting the case and ordering both sides ""to sit down and see if you can work it out because whatever you work out today would be less expensive to everybody than what you would work out in the future.""
The SEC filed a civil suit in March accusing Volkswagen and its former chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, of defrauding investors in U.S. bond offerings.
Volkswagen was caught using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global backlash against diesel vehicles that has so far cost it 30 billion euros ($33.3 billion) in fines, penalties and buyback costs worldwide. In May, it set aside an additional 5.5 billion euros in contingent liabilities.
Breyer cited a California SEC case that found any penalty could be reduced to account for other criminal or civil payments and he referenced the massive U.S. diesel costs VW has paid to date.
The SEC did not immediately comment Friday.
Breyer said in May he was ""totally mystified"" why the SEC waited until 2019 to file suit.
The SEC defended its pace of investigation saying in a court filing its staff worked as ""quickly as possible under very difficult circumstances to complete an investigation into numerous different securities offerings conducted by a foreign company and three of its affiliates over many years.""
Volkswagen has said it ""cooperated fully with the SEC’s investigation"" and argued the SEC was ""now piling on.""
Regulators and investors argue VW should have informed them sooner about the scope of the scandal, while the automaker says it was not clear then it would face billions of dollars in fines.

VW issued more than $13 billion in bonds and asset-backed securities in U.S. markets at a time when senior executives knew that more than 500,000 U.S. diesel vehicles grossly exceeded legal vehicle emissions limits, the SEC complaint said.

Levies on Apple's MacBooks and iPhones were delayed until December, while tariffs on its AirPods, Apple Watch and HomePod will go into effect as scheduled next month.
The United States and China are locked in a trade war over U.S. demands that China change its policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other trade barriers.

Trump said on Thursday that U.S. and Chinese negotiators were holding ""productive"" trade talks and expected them to meet in September.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is sparing some Chinese-made household furniture, baby items and internet modems and routers from its next rounds of 10% tariffs, it said on Friday.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office released a complete list of the items that were removed from $300 billion in tariffs scheduled to go into effect on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, some of which had already been hit with 25% tariffs.
Trump on Tuesday delayed more than half of the proposed tariffs until December, saying it would help shield businesses and consumers from the U.S.-China trade war fallout during the Christmas selling season.
The new list of 44 categories of spared imports, worth about $7.8 billion according to U.S. Census Bureau data, also includes some chemical compounds used in the manufacture of plastics. Reuters previously reported that bibles and religious texts would be spared from the tariff list.
Modems and routers made in China were part of a $200 billion list of products hit with tariffs last September that have since been raised to 25%. Friday's exclusion would avoid a further 10% hike as Trump imposes tariffs on Sept. 1 to products in the same broad customs category, including smart watches, smart speakers and Bluetooth headphones.
The bulk of the items removed from the tariff list were furniture products, including wooden- and metal-framed chairs and those made of plastics. Some of these were previously hit with tariffs as part of broader furniture categories.
Baby-related furniture items also were spared, including toddler beds, bassinets, cradles, strollers and children's seats.
The $114 billion retail furniture industry has been among the sector's hardest hit with price increases due to Trump's tariffs, which rose to 25% in May.
The U.S. Labor Department said on Tuesday that the price index for household furnishings rose 0.4% in July, marking its third consecutive monthly increase and contributing to broad-based growth in consumer prices during July."

Despite the delay, analysts on Friday said they expect Mountain Valley will enter service in the third or fourth quarter of 2020. The company has said the $4.8-$5.0 billion pipe would enter service in mid-2020.
Officials at EQM were not immediately available for comment.
In a letter to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Thursday, EQM said it was voluntarily suspending new work on Mountain Valley in areas where such activities present a potential risk to endangered species or destruction of critical habitat areas.
EQM's decision to suspend work was in response to a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club earlier this week in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, according to analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington.
In that case, the Sierra Club asked the court to vacate Mountain Valley's biological opinion and incidental take statement, which allow construction of the pipe in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species.
The analysts said they do not expect the Fish and Wildlife Service or EQM will pursue litigation since the Fourth Circuit would likely side with the Sierra Club as the court did in a case against another long-delayed project - Dominion Energy Inc's (N:D) Atlantic Coast pipe from West Virginia to North Carolina.
Instead, EQM decided to voluntarily suspend work, the analysts said, noting the company had already completed work in those areas or was already barred from working in them until it gets a new permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that would allow the pipe to cross streams and other waterbodies.
Height Capital expects the Army Corps will reissue the permit in coming months.
When EQM started construction in February 2018, it estimated Mountain Valley would cost about $3.5 billion and be completed by the end of 2018.
The 303-mile (488-km) pipeline is designed to deliver 2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.
Mountain Valley is owned by units of EQM,  NextEra Energy Inc  (N:NEE), Consolidated Edison Inc (N:ED),  AltaGas Ltd  (TO:ALA) and  RGC Resources Inc  (O:RGCO)."
40,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2019 06:49PM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: Lower rates could boost housing stocks, but risks remain","By Evan Sully
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lower U.S. interest rates could help support outperforming U.S. homebuilder stocks, even as they raise worries about the economy, while a bonanza of industry data and Federal Reserve speakers next week are likely to help shape the outlook.
After underperforming in 2018, the PHLX Housing Index (HGX) is up about 30% for the year so far, roughly double the year-to-date gain of the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX). 
Mortgage rates have been declining with U.S. Treasury debt yields, and the outlook for interest rates suggests further easing after the Federal Reserve lowered rates last month and indicated it could cut again this year, depending on data.
This week, U.S. 30-year Treasury yields fell to a record low below 2%, while benchmark 10-year yields declined to a three-year trough as trade tensions linger and global economic growth continues to slow.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to 3.60% from a peak of 4.94% in November, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates are often tied to the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield.
Strategists said that could bode well for homebuilders and the housing market, which has been struggling because of land and labor shortages.
A report on Friday showed U.S. homebuilding fell for a third straight month in July amid a steep decline in the construction of multifamily housing units, even as the data provided a positive sign for housing: a jump in permits to a seven-month high.
Next week, the U.S. Commerce Department will release data on July new home sales. 
Housing and homebuilding stocks should continue to do well as long as rates remain low, but the potential for slower demand is a risk, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. 
""Lower interest rates lead to lower mortgage rates (which) lead to increased demand for homebuilders,"" he said. ""You counter that with potential concerns that, if a recession is coming, even if rates are at historically low levels, demand for everything is going to be somewhat mitigated.""
Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, has seen relatively good traction in housing even with the turbulent markets. Lower rates are a plus, he said, along with an unemployment rate at its lowest level in years.
""Consumer savings have come up, household formation continues to grow faster than the supply of housing,"" Marshall said. ""And I think all of those things coming together make for a more stable environment for the publicly traded housing stocks.""
Recent results from some top homebuilders were mostly stronger than analysts expected, but some forecasts disappointed investors, underlining persisting problems in the housing market. 
Last month, PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM) forecast full-year home sales and gross margins below analyst expectations and cited rising land costs, while in June  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) forecast current-quarter earnings below Wall Street estimates and noted uncertainty triggered by the U.S.-China trade war.
Multiples for some of the homebuilder stocks have jumped this year, but many remain below long-term averages. The S&P 500 homebuilding index <.SPLRCHOME>, which includes PulteGroup, D.R. Horton (N:DHI) and Lennar, is trading at about 9.5 times forward earnings, up from about 7 at the start of the year but well below a long-term average of 14.6, based on Refinitiv's data.
Graphic: S&P 500 homebuilders rebounding but still relatively cheap - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/4868/4825/Pasted%20Image.jpg
Wedbush analysts in a research note on Thursday said that builders have been reducing square footages as mortgage rates have declined, which has addressed affordability issues. The firm has a bullish bias on homebuilder shares, with an ""outperform"" rating on William Lyon Homes (N:WLH), Beazer Homes USA (N:BZH), Lennar and others.
Investors will pay close attention to comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is set to give a speech on rates and policy at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, policy symposium.

""The fact that the Fed has moved to a more dovish position suggests that those rates should remain relatively low compared to what ... we saw in late 2018,"" said Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian power company CPFL Energia (SA:CPFE3) is in an expansion phase that could include the purchase of fellow utility Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais (SA:CMIG4), known as Cemig, CPFL Chief Executive Officer Gustavo Estrella told Reuters on Friday.
""Cemig is in the same region as CPFL, so it's an asset that we would have to look at and evaluate,"" Estrella said in an interview.
Earlier on Friday, Cemig CEO Cledorvino Belini said its privatization may be approved this year. According to data from Refinitiv Eikon, Cemig, which is controlled by Minas Gerais state, has a market value of about 22 billion reais ($5.5 billion).
The strategy for CPFL, which is controlled by State Grid Corporation of China, is to look at a wide range of assets from generation and renewables to distribution and transmission lines, Estrella said, also noting the company's drive to reduce debt.
""The size of CPFL and the size of our shareholder should give an indication on the scale of the company's ambitions. So we don't rule out any potential assets,"" Estrella said.
State Grid, the world's largest electric company, paid 14.2 billion reais for control of CPFL in early 2017."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Ratings agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor's downgraded Argentina's sovereign debt rating on Friday, flagging higher chances of a default in the wake of a shock primary election result that plunged the country into its latest economic crisis.
Argentine markets were in free-fall for most of the week after Sunday's vote when center-left presidential candidate Alberto Fernandez trounced center-right President Mauricio Macri. The scale of Fernandez's victory suggested he could win the October ballot in the first round, potentially putting an end to free-market economic reforms and an IMF-backed austerity plan. 
The downgrades cap a tough week in which the peso lost nearly 20% of its value, forcing the central bank to eat into its reserves with dollar auctions. Fitch downgraded Argentina's sovereign debt rating from 'B' to 'CCC,' while S&P lowered its rating to 'B-' from 'B.'
""The downgrade of Argentina's ratings reflects elevated policy uncertainty following the primary elections, a severe tightening of financing conditions, and an expected deterioration in the macroeconomic environment that increase the likelihood of a sovereign default or restructuring of some kind,"" Fitch said. 
Fitch said it expected Argentina's economy to contract 2.5% in 2019, down from a previous forecast of 1.7%. Fitch added that it saw government debt rising to around 95% of gross domestic product in 2019. 
S&P saw 2019 growth falling 2.3%, compared with a prior forecast of a 1.6% decline. 
Alejo Czerwonko, emerging markets strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management's Chief Investment Office, said the downgrade was not going to substantially change many people's minds about the solidity of Argentine debt. 
""Argentina was already rated deep into junk territory and this is pushing the rating a bit deeper, but it reveals little new information to investors,"" he said.
While Fitch said it expects growth to be flat in 2020, S&P saw 2020 growth at 0.5%, compared with a prior forecast of 2.2%, highlighting uncertainty over the policies of Fernandez. 
Fitch said the chances of Fernandez winning the election had grown, raising doubts about the future of Macri's IMF-backed austerity plan. The fact that Fernandez's running mate is leftist former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a longtime skeptic of the IMF program, only heightened those doubts, Fitch said.

""We could lower the ratings over the next 12-18 months if economic and financial stresses continue to mount,"" S&P said, adding it saw ""a greater than one-in-three chance of a downgrade over the coming year.""

But a tumultuous week that saw the Dow Jones industrials lose 800 points on Wednesday, ended with the major U.S. averages showing modest losses. 
The Dow ended Friday up 307 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 rose 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite index climbed nearly 1.7%.
The Dow's gain was its second of more than 300 points during the week. Four of the Dow's five session ended with daily gains or losses of more than 300 points, including that big 800-point loss. Thursday ended with the Dow up 99.97 points.
The Dow ended the week down 1.53%. The S&P 500 was off 1.03 for the week, with the Nasdaq down 0.8%. But the declines were the third-straight for each index and their fourth losses in five weeks. 
The major averages have fallen back after hitting new highs in July, mostly because of the Trump Administration's threats to impose new tariffs on imports from China starting Sept. 1. Despite Friday's gains, the Dow was off 5.5% from its July peak, with the S&P 500 down 4.6% and the Nasdaq down 5.3%. 
The trade tensions eased a bit after President Donald Trump agreed to delay tariffs on many products, especially electronics and other consumer goods ahead of the holiday shopping season. They seemed to ease more on Friday if only because there were few ugly tweets or other pronouncements. 
It's not clear if the two sides are embarked on trying to resolve their differences with less incendiary rhetoric, however. So volatility is likely to continue.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded on Friday as an ebbing bond rally and news of potential German economic stimulus brought buyers back to the equities market, closing the book on a tumultuous week. 
While all three major U.S. stock averages ended the session higher, they still logged their third consecutive weekly losses, having been rattled since Monday by growing U.S.-China trade animosity, simmering geopolitical tensions and signals from the bond market that sparked fears of impending recession.
Germany's coalition government is willing to suspend its balanced budget rule and take on debt, according to Der Spiegel magazine, raising hopes that Europe's largest economy could steer itself away from recession and cooling worries over a global economic slowdown.
""The market is looking for some positive news to take into the weekend,"" said Mark Kepner, equity trader at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. 
David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York, agreed, but added that underlying anxieties remain. 
""(It was a) great headline but further analysis may eventually create uncertainty and weaken markets,"" Carter said. ""The level of uncertainty around the world is rising significantly, with no clear end in sight."" 
German stimulus hopes helped the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rise from three-year lows, closing the book on a fraught week which saw 10-year yields dip below those of two-year notes, a classic recessionary red flag.
Rising bond yields gave a boost to rate-sensitive banks, sending the S&P 500 Banks index <.SPXBK> up 2.6%
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 306.62 points, or 1.2%, to 25,886.01, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 41.09 points, or 1.44%, to 2,888.69 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 129.38 points, or 1.67%, to 7,895.99.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 closed firmly in the black, with industrials (SPLRCI), technology (SPLRCT) and financials (SPSY) enjoying the largest percentage gains. 
 Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) jumped 7.3% after the chipmaker's quarterly results bested analyst estimates, helping the Philadelphia chip index (SOX) gain 2.8%.
Deere & Co (N:DE) cut its earnings forecast after missing Street profit estimates in the face of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. Still, the farm equipment maker's decision to cut costs sent the stock up 3.8%.
 General Electric  Co (N:GE) surged by 9.7% after Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp bought nearly $2 million in shares in the wake of the conglomerate's worst one-day percentage drop in 11 years.
The second-quarter earnings season approaches the finish line, with 459 of the companies in the S&P 500 having posted results. Of those, 73% beat Street estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
Analysts now see S&P 500 second-quarter earnings growth of 2.9% year-on-year, per Refinitiv.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.69-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 39 new highs and 106 new lows.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said Ottawa would buy 360 light armored vehicles from General Dynamics Land Systems Canada in a deal worth up to C$3 billion ($2.26 billion). It is also offering the firm a repayable loan of C$650 million.
The vehicles will be built in London, in the province of Ontario. The Liberals hold most of Ontario's seats in the House of Commons and need to retain them to stand any chance of holding onto power in the Oct. 21 election.
The deal is the latest in a string of high-profile government spending announcements in politically sensitive parts of Canada. The official opposition Conservatives, tied in polls with the Liberals, accuse their rivals of trying to buy votes.
Sajjan spokesman Todd Lane denied any link to the election, saying money for the vehicles had been announced in 2017.
""This is about taking care of our women and men in uniform,"" he said by telephone.
The contract will help preserve jobs at the General Dynamics plant amid continuing uncertainty over the fate of a separate $13 billion deal to sell light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia. Critics, citing concerns over Riyadh's human rights record, insist the contract be scrapped.
Ottawa is still studying whether to tear up the deal, which it says would cost millions of dollars in penalties."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday said Cantor Fitzgerald & Co and BMO Capital Markets had agreed to pay $647,000 and $3.9 million respectively to settle charges of improper handling of ""pre-released"" American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). 
With the latest actions, the SEC has charged 13 financial institutions in its ongoing investigation into abusive ADR practices, which has so far led to more than $427 million in monetary settlements.
Previous settlements with banks and brokers since 2017 include JPMorgan Chase & Co. (N:JPM) ($135 million), U.S. subsidiaries of  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) ($74 million), Banca IMI (LON:IMI) Securities ($35 million) and Wedbush Securities Inc. ($8 million). 
Cantor Fitzgerald and BMO obtained pre-released ADRs indirectly from other broker-dealers when ""they should have known that the pre-release transactions were not backed by foreign shares,"" according to the SEC.
ADR CRACKDOWN
The multi-year SEC effort has aimed to clean up common abuses related to the use of ""pre-release"" ADRs. 
ADRs are U.S. traded securities that represent shares of foreign-listed companies. To ensure that the price of the U.S. shares match those abroad, banks and brokers who deal in ADRs are required to hold a corresponding amount of foreign stock, or ensure that their counterparties or clients do the same. 
Because of slight differences is international trade settlement times, ADRs are allowed to be ""pre-released"" to close any gap, usually less than a few days. That's where, according to the SEC, banks and brokers flouted the requirement to hold enough foreign shares, creating an undue surplus. 
The offending banks and brokers unjustly profited from trafficking in those phantom shares, according to the SEC. The pre-release shares were sometimes used for abusive practices, according to the SEC, such as ""naked"" short selling - betting against a company without actually borrowing shares - and an international tax dodge technique known as dividend arbitrage. 
""This is a big win for investors,"" said Norm Champ, a senior partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP and former director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management. 

""These cases continue Chairman Clayton’s efforts to maintain U.S. markets as the best in the world by rooting out practices that contribute to mispricing of publicly traded securities.""

The century bonds, sold in 2017, tumbled 29% this week, even after gaining on Thursday and Friday. That’s a big loss for the largest reported holders, which include BlackRock, Royal Bank of Canada,  Legg Mason  Inc (NYSE:LM). and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A spokeswoman at BlackRock, the biggest reported holder, declined to comment. Representatives at RBC, Legg Mason and Northwestern Mutual didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The three chief executives were in Washington for a previously scheduled meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on banking secrecy and money laundering, according to people familiar with the matter. On a conference call, they briefed the president, who was at his resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.
The talks came during a tumultuous day in markets as Trump’s trade war with China continued to cast a cloud over the global economy. Stocks plummeted as signs appeared in the bond market a recession could be on the horizon.
Moynihan, speaking in a Bloomberg Television interview on Friday, said the turmoil has been driven by issues outside the U.S., and that recession risks are low.
“We have nothing to fear about a recession right now except for the fear of recession,” Moynihan said.
Back-and-forth posturing by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping has kept investors on edge amid volatility that’s gripped markets for most of August. China called looming U.S. tariffs a violation of accords, while Trump said Thursday that any deal with Beijing must be “on our terms.”
Spokespeople for JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America declined to comment, as did the Treasury Department."

The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index fell in August to its second-lowest level since just before the 2016 election. But a deeper look of the numbers by party affiliation shows warning signs for Trump, the survey’s director says.
“What I’d keep my eye on is the independents because whoever wins the majority of independents will win the presidency,” Richard Curtin, director of the Michigan survey, said on a conference call with reporters.
Voters historically had higher consumer confidence when a president of their party is in the White House. Independents saw a big boost in optimism after Trump’s election but their confidence is now at the lowest level of his presidency.
Curtin said announcements of new tariffs in a trade war with China are weighing on purchasing decisions as consumers expected inflation to eat into the buying power of their paychecks.
On Thursday, Trump downplayed economic indicators suggesting that a recession is becoming more likely, citing earnings by retailers. “The economy is incredible. The consumer -- probably above all else, the consumer is doing incredibly,” he told reporters before leaving for a campaign rally in New Hampshire."

But with the trade war dragging on and farm credit conditions deteriorating, that could turn out to be a risky bet.
The world’s biggest tractor maker expects its fourth-quarter sales will increase from a year earlier, with more of the Trump administration’s trade-war payments for farmers lifting farm cash receipts for 2019.
The latest bailout includes $14.5 billion in direct payments to farmers, which could lead to some “incremental demand,” Deere executives told analysts on a Friday call to discuss financial results. The impact could be delayed or dampened by the tough agriculture environment, Luke Chandler, Deere’s chief economist, said.
But farmer debt is rising as Trump’s trade wars have stifled export markets. Agricultural credit conditions in the seventh district deteriorated in the second quarter, with the highest portion of customers having major or severe difficulties repaying loans in 20 years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
Farmers may not go for six-figure tractors and combines with their windfall, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Chris Ciolino. They’ll more likely use it more conservatively to pay down debt, or even save it.
“There’s a growing risk that the replacement cycle gets delayed beyond 2020 given the persistent trade uncertainty,” Ciolino said. “I have trouble seeing a catalyst in the near-to-mid term that will instill enough confidence.”"

Nextmove said it had ordered 100 electric vehicles in 2018 but raised objections over quality and finish after taking delivery of the first 15 Model 3 cars earlier this year.
The rental company said following a dispute over how to resolve the quality shortcomings, Tesla triggered a refund clause but Tesla disputes that it canceled the order.
Tesla said Nextmove chose not to take delivery of the cars.
Nextmove said its Model 3 vehicles had paint defects, faulty wiring, scratches on the dashboard, faulty wheels and condensation in the headlights.
Offering faulty vehicles to rental customers would compromise Nextmove's reputation for quality, the German company said.
Tesla said it was in the process of resolving the issues and had provided replacement vehicles.
""We believe the customer's decision not to take delivery of its remaining Model 3 orders wasn't entirely due to quality issues, but was largely influenced by their frustration with an unrelated dispute from earlier in the year,"" Tesla said in a statement, without elaborating further.
Tesla said any customer who was unhappy with their car could return it for a full refund up to seven days after purchase.
It said customer satisfaction data showed that German customers have largely been satisfied with their vehicles, including the quality and condition of their cars upon delivery.
Tesla is counting on the Model 3 to help the company become profitable on a sustainable basis and transform it from a niche player to a heavyweight in the automobile industry. But Elon Musk has warned the company faced ""manufacturing hell"" as he has tried to scale up production of the Model 3.
Bloomberg news was first to report the cancellation of the 85 vehicles."

63,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2019 01:01PM ET</span>",Russian businessman behind shuttered Latvian bank PNB attacks ECB,"By John O'Donnell and Gederts Gelzis
FRANKFURT/RIGA (Reuters) - The Russian former owner of a stricken Latvian lender has attacked the European Central Bank (ECB) for abruptly shutting it, amid a bitter dispute after he previously accused an ECB governor of corruption.
Grigory Guselnikov said he had found buyers for his stake in PNB Banka but the ECB had not given enough time to hand over ownership and inject capital, leaving the shuttered lender vulnerable to being ""looted"" in a hasty wind-up.
In an interview with Reuters, Guselnikov said the ECB, the supervisor, rushed through this week's decision to shut it without good reason and had been motivated by his earlier claims that the Latvian central bank governor had demanded bribes.
His account was countered by the central bank. ""ECB Banking Supervision, in its assessment that PNB Banka was failing or likely to fail due to significant capital shortfalls, acted in strict accordance with the rules,"" said a spokeswoman.
The dispute over PNB's closure comes more than a year after U.S. authorities accused Latvia's third-biggest bank ABLV of money laundering and breaking sanctions on North Korea, prompting its closure and triggering the country’s worst financial crisis in a decade.
A corruption probe centred on Latvian central bank chief Ilmars Rimsevics has compounded the country's image problems.
Guselnikov had more than a year ago accused Rimsevics of demanding bribes. Rimsevics, who has denied any wrongdoing, was detained last year and remains under investigation by state prosecutors, although he is still awaiting trial.
Rimsevics did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.
NEW CAPITAL
A top European court ruled that Rimsevics should not have been barred from office, in an embarrassing setback for the Baltic state.
""It is a shameful story for the ECB as well as for Latvia,"" Guselnikov told Reuters. ""That is why they don't give ... a chance to save the bank.""
He said a group of investors were ready to step in with new capital, adding: ""The ECB ... opens the door to loot the bank. The ECB may be responsible for the damage caused.""
In a statement PNB also disputed the ECB's ""sudden"" decision, insisting it had met all regulatory requirements.
Roger Tamraz, a Middle Eastern investor and chairman of oil and banking group Netoil, said he and a handful of others remained willing to buy a stake and put up fresh capital worth roughly 140 million euros ($155 million).
""We asked for 90 days, not nine years,"" Tamraz told Reuters, referring to the time needed to complete the paperwork for a deal. ""If there is good will, we can always solve the problem.""
The ECB said it had acted according to the rules.
Since Latvia secured independence from Russia in 1991, more than a dozen of its banks had promoted themselves as a gateway to Western markets for clients in former Soviet states, promising Swiss-style secrecy.
That policy has now been abandoned under pressure from the United States, but despite predictions by Latvian officials a year ago that many would close, most of the banks are still open.
Latvia faces a review by international money-laundering standards watchdog Moneyval, which some officials fear could label the country as risky, alongside the likes of Serbia and Pakistan."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bakkt Trust Co LLC has been granted a license to operate as a limited liability trust company, the New York State Department of Financial Services said on Friday.
Bakkt is a cryptocurrency platform affiliate of Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), which also owns the New York Stock Exchange.
A trust company is technically different from a bank in New York but can take deposits and make loans, and act as an agent for government bodies. A limited liability trust company must maintain significant capital reserves consistent with those of a premier fiduciary business, market participants said.
In a statement, DFS said it has authorized Bakkt to provide custody services for bitcoin in conjunction with the launch of physically delivered bitcoin futures contracts. 
Bakkt will serve institutional customers and its bitcoin futures contracts will be listed for trading on ICE Futures US and cleared through ICE Clear US, the DFS said.  Both entities are affiliates of Bakkt.
DFS has so far approved 22 charters or licenses for companies in the virtual currency marketplace.
In a statement, Bakkt Chief Operating Officer Adam White said the trust license enables the company ""to offer institutional-grade custody via the Bakkt Warehouse alongside the federally regulated Bakkttm Bitcoin Futures contracts.""
In a notice on Friday, ICE Futures US announced it will list the new Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) monthly and Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) daily futures contracts for trading on Sept. 23.
The crypto-platform earlier faced regulatory delays since ICE announced plans for the new venture last August.
Exchange operators CME Group Inc (O:CME) and Cboe Global Markets Inc (Z:CBOE) already offer bitcoin futures in the United States, though Cboe's last contract settles this month and has not been renewed.

Der Spiegel, citing unnamed sources, said the shareholders had ""concrete thoughts"" about replacing him. Der Spiegel didn't name the investors it said were pressing for the change.
Achleitner, under pressure from shareholders for some time, survived a confidence vote at May's annual shareholders' meeting. But Deutsche shares hit a record low on Friday, highlighting investor scepticism about the bank's latest turnaround plan.
Achleitner has begun the search for a successor but intends to complete his term, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.
Der Spiegel named Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann and Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) Chairman Nikolaus von Bomhard as two people who fit the profile for a possible successor, but it added that neither had been approached.
 Deutsche Bank  said in a statement: ""Mr. Achleitner is mandated until 2022. Furthermore, all questions regarding succession planning on the supervisory board are handled by the nomination committee.""
The office of von Bomhard didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Bundesbank declined to comment. Munich Re didn't respond to a request for comment.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co. (N:DE) on Friday announced a review of costs after a combination of the U.S.-China trade war and bad weather dented its quarterly profits, forcing the company to trim its full-year earnings forecast for a second time in the past three months.
Investors cheered the decision to control costs, sending its shares up 3.1% at $148.07.
The Moline, Illinois-based company said it is assessing its manufacturing footprint as part of the cost structure review. 
It will reduce production by 20% at its facilities in Illinois and Iowa in the second of half of the year. The cuts will impact the production of large tractors.
The cost control measures are estimated to result in $25 million in savings this year and will be a centerpiece of its strategy over the next three years, the company told analysts on an earning call.
The comments came after Deere's production costs in the third-quarter shot up by 2 percentage points from a quarter ago. Yet despite its efforts, full-year production costs are projected to be above its previous estimates.
Deere now expects full-year net income of $3.2 billion on annual sales growth of 4%, lower than the income of $3.3 billion on sales increases of about 5% projected earlier.
""Concerns about export-market access, near-term demand for commodities such as soybeans, and overall crop conditions, have caused many farmers to postpone major equipment purchases,"" said Chief Executive Officer Samuel Allen. 
Rival agricultural machine makers AGCO Corp (N:AGCO) and CNH Industrial (N:CNHI) have also slashed production to keep inventory in line with retail demand.
The year-long tariff war between the United States and China has slashed the export earnings of American farmers. China imported $9.1 billion of U.S. farm produce in 2018, down from $19.5 billion in 2017, according to the American Farm Bureau.
U.S. shipments to China of soybeans, the country's most valuable farm export, sank to a 16-year low last year as Beijing mostly shifted purchases to Brazil, leaving American farmers with surplus.
A record-wet spring, meanwhile, has devastated a wide swath of the U.S. farm belt and inflicted more economic pain on soybean and corn producers, particularly those whose fields were too wet to ever plant, dampening hopes of an improvement in farm income and equipment sales.
Deere expects industry sales of agricultural equipment to be about the same as last year in the United States and Canada, which account for 60% of its overall business. Sales in the region were earlier projected to be flat to up 5% earlier.
For the quarter ended July 28, adjusted profits came in at $2.71 per share, below $2.85 per share expected by analysts in a Refinitiv IBES survey.

Sales at its agriculture & turf segment, the biggest source of the company's revenues, declined 6% year-on-year during the quarter. Overall, equipment sales were down 3%.

LONDON (Reuters) - A UK High Court judge has blocked the transfer of 12 billion pounds ($15 billion) in annuities from insurer  Prudential  (L:PRU) to Rothesay Life, the two companies said on Friday. 
The deal, which would have been the largest ever such transfer covering 400,000 policy holders, was announced in March last year at the same time Prudential said it was to demerge its UK business. 
In response to tougher European Union rules introduced after the financial crisis, insurers have increasingly looked to free up capital by offloading closed books of annuity business to specialist firms such as Rothesay and Phoenix Group.
The details of the ruling were not immediately available, but are likely to lead to questions about whether other similar big deals in the sector can be struck. At 1329 GMT, Prudential shares were down 0.7%.
Prudential, which can appeal the decision, said it would have no impact on the company's planned demerger of its UK insurance and asset management business, set to complete in the fourth quarter.
The insurer said it was ""disappointed"" by the verdict.
""The Independent Expert, who was appointed to report to the High Court, concluded the transfer would have no material adverse effect on the security of benefits or the reasonable benefit expectations of our policyholders.""
Rothesay, whose investors include U.S. private equity giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Singapore sovereign fund GIC, is Britain's largest specialist annuity insurer.
It said the deal had already been approved by regulators the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulatory Authority. 
""Whilst it is not the preferred or optimal outcome for either party, it will not have a material impact on Rothesay Life as a whole,"" it said. 

(This story corrects paragraph 8 to say that Rothesay is already Britain's largest specialist annuity insurer)

The University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index slumped to 92.1 from July’s 98.4, missing all forecasts in Bloomberg's survey of economists. The gauge of current conditions decreased to 107.4 while the expectations index dropped to 82.3, bringing both readings to the lowest levels since early this year.
Key Insights

The second-lowest confidence reading of Donald Trump's presidency shows consumers may be poised to offer less of a boost to the record economic expansion amid volatility in financial markets and headwinds from abroad. Personal consumption, the biggest part of the economy, was the largest driver of the expansion in the second quarter.
The biggest drop in confidence since January underscores how growing odds of a recession before the 2020 election threaten to dim Trump’s chances of winning a second term. Measures of consumer sentiment by political party showed that confidence for Republicans fell to the lowest of Trump's term. Readings for independents dropped while those for Democrats improved.
Consumers “strongly reacted” to the proposed increases in tariffs on Chinese goods, a subject that was spontaneously cited by 33% of those surveyed, near the recent peak of 37%, according to the report. Americans also concluded, following the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate cut in a decade, that they may need to be more cautious about spending in anticipation of a potential recession, the report said.
The July 31-Aug. 14 survey period corresponded with an especially volatile period: The Fed rate cut, Trump raised tariffs on consumer goods from China then delayed some, and signs of global malaise multiplied. 
Markets convulsed in those two weeks. U.S. stocks posted their two steepest drops of the year while yields on 30- year Treasury bonds fell to record low and 10-year yields dipped below the two-year in a harbinger of recession in the next 18 months.

Official's View
“The main takeaway for consumers from the first cut in interest rates in a decade was to increase apprehensions about a possible recession,” Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey, said in a statement. “Consumers concluded, following the Fed’s lead, that they may need to adopt a precautionary spending outlook in anticipation of a potential recession.”

The Michigan data follow the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index’s second-straight drop in the week ended Aug. 11, marking the largest back-to-back slide since 2011. The Conference Board’s confidence gauge rebounded in July to near the best level in 18 years.
Consumer expectations for inflation rose, climbing to 2.7% from 2.6% for the coming year and increasing to 2.6% from 2.5% for the next five years. The inflation readings follow findings released earlier this week in the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations, showing three-year inflation expectations slipped to a two-year low of 2.6% in July.

""Novo Nordisk disagrees with the allegations and is prepared to defend the company in this matter,"" the company said. 
The securities lawsuit was filed by a number of shareholders who claims compensation worth a total of 11.785 billion Danish crowns ($1.75 billion) based on trading of Novo shares for two years from February 2015. 
Filed in the Danish district court of Glostrup, the lawsuit alleges Novo Nordisk did not make ""appropriate disclosures regarding its sales of insulin products in the USA,"" Novo said. 
Lawyer Thomas Ryhl, representing about 260 pension funds behind the lawsuit, said Novo failed to tell the entire truth behind the company's increased revenue in the United States.
""They did, but they did it too late. What they said in 2016, they should have said already in 2014 and 2015,"" he said. 
The news had little immediate impact of Novo's shares which traded up 1% at 1345 GMT. 
""It is a very complex case and it's not black-and-white. I am far from certain, that Novo will lose this case,"" Sydbank's analyst Soren Lontoft Hansen told Reuters. 
""It will be a large fine if they do, but Novo has a strong financial foundation,"" Hansen added. 
According to Ryhl, Novo's revenue from insulin sales in the U.S. increased between 2015 and 2017, but Novo's rebates to pharmacy benefit managers equally rose in the same period. 
""Actually, Novo's profits from its insulin sales dropped, even though prices and sales increased,"" he told Reuters. 
In the period between February 2015 and February 2017, Novo's share price jumped between 220 and 410 Danish crowns. 
Novo said the Danish lawsuit contained ""broadly similar"" allegations to those of a previously announced securities class-action lawsuit filed in the US in 2017 against the company. 

That ongoing lawsuit alleges Novo has misled investors and colluded with industry peers to increase drug prices and artificially inflate its financial results, according to Novo.

Oliver Zipse addressed staff in an internal email a day after his predecessor Harald Krueger stepped down. BMW has lost ground to Mercedes-Benz producer Daimler in the past five years and seen rivals such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jump ahead in electric car sales.
""Instead of blaming the current situation, conditions, political landscape or particular individuals, a positive spirit will enable us to seize the opportunities available to us. Such a positive spirit will be reflected in our culture: the harder the job, the more innovative our solution,"" Zipse said.
""We don't always have to be first, but we most certainly have to be far better than our competitors in everything that we do. This applies not only to our products and services, but also to our processes and structures, as well as our costs,"" he said.
BMW has already narrowed the sales gap between BMW and Mercedes and is preparing to launch more models, Zipse said.
BMW's flexible production methods, which allow the carmaker to build electric and combustion-engined cars on the same production line, provide a major competitive advantage because it will allow the carmaker to scale up or slow down production of electric cars in line with demand, Zipse said."

Tang is the head of Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company - which like Cathay is managed by Swire Pacific Ltd (HK:0019).
The airline also said Paul Loo had resigned as chief customer and commercial officer, to be replaced by the head of its low-cost arm Hong Kong Express, Ronald Lam. 
Cathay Chairman John Slosar said recent events had called into question Cathay's commitment to flight safety and security and put its reputation and brand under pressure.
""This is regrettable as we have always made safety and security our highest priority,"" he said in a statement. ""We therefore think it is time to put a new management team in place who can reset confidence and lead the airline to new heights.""
Cathay whose strong British links make it a symbol of Hong Kong's colonial past, has emerged as the highest-profile corporate target as Beijing looks to quell protests in the territory that have gone on for 10 straight weeks.
Hogg, who is British and was appointed CEO in May 2017, said it was right for Loo and him to take responsibility as leaders of the company.
""This is a grave and critical time for our airlines,"" Hogg said in an email to staff on Friday evening seen by Reuters. ""There is no doubt that our brand and reputation are under immense pressure and this pressure has been growing for some weeks, particularly in the all-important market of mainland China.""
He said in hindsight, he and Loo could have managed the crisis differently, but he did not elaborate in the email.
Hogg's resignation was first announced by Chinese state television, CCTV. It was unclear, however, if it would help revive the company's reputation on the mainland. 
""The roots are rotten. It doesn't make a difference no matter who's leading the company,"" a Chinese social media user said on the Twitter-like Weibo platform in a post liked more than 2,000 times.
DAMAGE CONTROL
Cathay has said it is fully committed to Hong Kong under the principle of ""One Country, Two Systems"" and was confident Hong Kong would have a great future.
""Cathay's change in management could be a positive in the short term as it provides the company with a 'clean slate' so to speak,"" BOCOM International analyst Luya You said. 
""In the meantime, the focus for Cathay right now is still damage control for its branding. Its reputation among mainland passengers continues to falter, which could lead to more long-lasting damage that is harder and takes longer to rebound from."" 
The airline, 30% owned by Air China (SS:601111), became embroiled in crosswinds between Beijing and pro-democracy groups in the Asian financial hub after some of its employees took part in the Hong Kong protests. 
Cathay shares plumbed 10-year lows on Tuesday, but rebounded the next day after the airline condemned the protests, vowed to follow Chinese aviation regulations and terminated the employment of two pilots.
Cathay this week canceled 272 flights, affecting more than 55,000 passengers, as its home airport was shutdown by protests. 
The carrier is also seeing a drop in forward bookings due to the local unrest, it said last week after swinging to a first-half profit based on a turnaround plan led by Hogg, a highly regarded executive in the aviation industry.

""It is disappointing to learn of his resignation particularly given this current challenging period,"" said an analyst, who was not authorized to speak publicly about personnel changes.

The London Stock Exchange suffered a ""technical software issue"", which postponed the opening of trading until 0840 GMT, a spokeswoman said in an email. The markets normally open at 0700 GMT.
In a statement on its website, it said it was still investigating the issue.
The fault affected hundreds of shares in some of the UK's largest companies, including Shell (LON:RDSa),  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and HSBC and BHP Group, worth a total of $2.8 trillion.
Traders were frustrated by the latest outage coming during a hectic week on global financial markets, hit by worries about a U.S. recession and the U.S.-China trade spat.
""Investors would have been yearning for a quiet Friday after a week of turmoil for the markets driven by recession fears,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
""It looked like just such a peaceful interlude was on the cards until (the LSE's) technical issues.""
A large number of market participants were also away on holiday, which may have limited the impact of the failure.
Paul Mumford, a fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management said it would be a ""major embarrassment"" for the LSE amid stiffening competition, rising costs and greater regulation among exchange operators.
LSE shares listed on the FTSE 100 were up 0.9% in early deals, in line with the broader FTSE 100.
This is the second outage at the LSE, which handles about 5 billion pounds ($6.1 billion) worth of volume each day, in just over a year.
In June 2018, the opening auction was delayed due to a technical fault, but trading resumed after an hour.
Prior to that, the market was shut until lunchtime one day in February 2011.
Reuters News' parent Thomson Reuters holds a 45% stake in financial data and news provider Refinitiv. Thomson Reuters will own 15% in LSE after the proposed deal closes."
83,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2019 07:16AM ET</span>",Dirty shipping fuel margins plunge as cleaner fuel rules loom,"By Ahmad Ghaddar and Julia Payne
LONDON (Reuters) - Margins for European high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO), used to power ships, sank this week as preparations for a global shift to cleaner maritime fuel next year start to weigh on prices.
High sulphur fuel oil is one of the dirtiest and cheapest products to come out of a refinery. It is used in power generation but has been the fuel of choice in global shipping for decades.
But most demand will evaporate after new rules from the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) which aim to cut pollution come into effect from January 1. More shipping fuel rules will come in the future to tackle climate change.
The approaching shift is already having an impact on the markets. Barge margins , for example, fell to minus $15.7 this week, a more than 5-year low.
A European fuel oil trader said that this week's sell-off was ""definitely IMO-related"".
(Graphic - High-sulphur fuel oil cracks png: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/OIL-PRODUCTS-FUELOIL/0H001QEQR7Y7/eikon.png)
The IMO has lowered the cap on sulphur content to a maximum 0.5% sulphur, a reduction of 3.5%.
Only ships with expensive kits that clean sulphur, known as scrubbers, will be allowed to continue burning HSFO.
The International Energy Agency estimates that high-sulphur fuel oil demand will fall by 60% to around 1.4 million bpd in 2020.
""The storage guys are getting ready as you need to refit the tanks to make sure you have room for compliant fuels like very low-sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO). There's no room for HSFO,"" the trader said.
Storage tanks at the world's biggest bunkering hub, Singapore, have become so full with the cleaner fuel that at the end of July, traders had booked at least 10 Very Large Crude Carriers to store more product offshore.
In the United Arab Emirates, Germany's Uniper (DE:UN01) revamped its Fujairah refinery earlier this year to produce fuel oil with a content of 0.1% to 0.5% sulphur.
Fuel oil stocks in the main hubs of ARA, Singapore and Fujairah fell by 3.9 million barrels week-on-week according to the most recent data, according to consultancy FGE.
""We're starting to see de-stocking of HSFO ahead of IMO,"" an fuel oil-focused industry source said.
Analysts say the fall in stocks also coincided with signs of a possible global recession as the China-U.S. trade war drags on. A slowdown in global trading activity hits demand for fuel oil because it is primarily used in the shipping industry.
""We had expected July to be the peak for HSFO markets but the violent sell-off this week was likely triggered by the escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, which led to a drop in oil prices and renewed fears of a recession as further tariffs would harm trade and demand for bunkering fuel,"" consultancy Energy Aspects said.
""With HSFO cracks falling off a cliff, we have now started to see considerable pressure on simple refining margins,"" Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said, adding that strong diesel margins were keeping overall margins for refineries afloat.
Refineries that do not have high-tech kits like cokers that can convert fuel oil into higher value products are known as simple refineries. These usually suffer more than their complex counterparts when fuel oil profits drop.
(Graphic - ARA fuel oil stocks png: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/OIL-PRODUCTS-FUELOIL/0H001QEQD7X3/eikon.png)
""With markets now just two months away from the first decisive shift towards IMO 2020 compliant fuel, HSFO cracks will get progressively weaker, but those who still need HSFO will have to pay up through higher differentials,"" Energy Aspects said.
The move is also a correction after a bounce caused by Saudi Arabia scooping up big volumes of HSFO from Europe for power stations to meet peak summer demand, traders said. This was met in part through crude-for-fuel swaps such as with Poland and Greece.
Also, U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela coupled with OPEC cuts has tightened availabilities of sour crudes that have high fuel oil yields."

By 6:50 AM ET, Dow futures were up 245 points, or 1.0% from late Thursday’s levels, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 27 points, also a gain of 1.0%.
The Nasdaq 100 futures contract was outperforming, with a gain of 1.3%, after a strong set of quarterly numbers from semiconductor maker Nvidia after the bell on Thursday encouraged hopes that the cycle for silicon chips may be turning up. 
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was indicated to open up 6.1% in premarket trade, while Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) was up 2.6% and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was up 1.3%. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 3.4%
Nvidia said the steep drop in revenue over the last year that was caused by sharp declines in demand from cryptocurrency miners and data centers appears to be bottoming out. It said revenue will be down less than 10% from year-earlier levels in the current quarter. One other bright spot was a record quarter for automotive chip sales, suggesting that the long-foretold surge in computer power in autos may finally be on the way.
However, the sector – like the broader market – remains captive to the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, on which there was no major news overnight, and where the next major development may well be a retaliation by China to President Donald Trump’s proposed extension of import tariffs on Chinese goods.
“Trump’s offer to postpone half of the additional tariffs due on 1 September until later in the year could be viewed as a positive step, but in truth it is only a small gesture and at the moment it remains difficult to project a path to a more general de-escalation in the trade war,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at Bluebay Asset Management, in a strategy note.
In the only major earnings report of the morning, agricultural machinery maker Deere & Co (NYSE:DE) cut its full-year profit forecasts after saying its sales fell 3% in the three months to July, although it said it still expects full-year sales to rise 5%. The stock has lost 16% since President Trump’s tariff announcement escalated the trade war with China at the end of last month.
""Concerns about export-market access, near-term demand for commodities such as soybeans, and overall crop conditions, have caused many farmers to postpone major equipment purchases,"" said Chief Executive Officer Samuel Allen.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2019 06:18AM ET</span>",U.S. surfboard makers not so stoked about China tariffs,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's decision to slap 10% tariffs on imported surfboards convinced surf executive Sue Bowers to move factory jobs out of China - but not back to the United States, which was one goal of Trump's tariffs.
Strict environmental rules and steep labor costs have sent scores of Southern (NYSE:SO) California surfboard manufacturers to China. Now, the tariffs have Bowers and other executives searching for factories in places such as Thailand and Vietnam.
""This was Surf City,"" said Bowers, general manager of Southern California Sports Industries in Orange County.
""I would like to have our production back here,"" said Bowers, whose office/warehouse is decorated with surf legend Mike Doyle's artwork and filled with surfboards bearing his name.
Instead, Bowers - not a surfer herself but who learned the ins-and-outs of surfboard construction from Doyle - is joining the growing list of U.S. manufacturers and retailers reconfiguring supply chains in the wake of the Trump's bitter trade war with China.
She was among a half dozen U.S. surf company executives who told Reuters they support using trade policy to shelter their homegrown industry from a daunting wave of international competition.
They are skeptical, however, about the President's latest round of tariffs, which on Sept. 1 will levy the first U.S. import taxes on surfboards.
""There are way too many things that need to change before we can bring jobs back,"" said Bowers, referring to U.S. labor costs and anti-pollution rules governing the use of materials to make surfboards.
Trump delayed putting the 10% duty on cellphones, laptops and other consumer goods in hopes of blunting their impact on U.S. holiday sales. But surfboards and many other products did not win a reprieve.
FORCES OF GLOBALIZATION
Southern California was surfing's epicenter in the late 1950s and early 1960s, spawning a billion-dollar international business around surfing's relaxed, sun-soaked lifestyle.
The forces of globalization that have eroded the industry were well underway by the turn of the century and the continuing manufacturing exodus threatens to wipe out domestic production.
""If something doesn't happen over the next 10 years (the industry) could cease to be here,"" said Shea Weber, chief executive of Dewey Weber International, a surfboard company started by his father - a famous long board ""hot-dogger"" who appeared in the classic surf documentary ""Endless Summer."" Dewey Weber still has a factory in San Clemente, California's ""surfboard alley.""
2018 surfboard imports hit 916,246, up from 102,850 in 2004, when the U.S. Census Bureau started collecting that trade data. Those imported surfboards now account for upwards of 90% of sales in the small and slow-growing domestic market, experts said.
China accounted for 67 percent of the surfboards that hit U.S. shores last year. Critics of Trump's tariffs say that focusing on just one country encourages manufacturers to move jobs to other Asian countries.
Countries like Thailand and Vietnam were already carving out niches on the high and low ends of the market with hourly factory wages that, according to Euromonitor International data, are roughly half that of China and as much as 19 times lower than in the United States.
California-based Firewire, backed by surf superstar Kelly Slater, moved production of its $500 to $1,000-plus surfboards to Thailand after shuttering U.S. manufacturing in 2008.
Taiwan has also edged into the market, building a cult following for its own Wavestorm surfboards that sell at Costco Warehouse Inc (O:COST) and other mass-market stores for as little as $99 - a price far below what U.S. producers can match.
Nicole Adams, who was testing a borrowed $200 Wavestorm on a recent Sunday in Venice Beach, is part of a new generation of surfers learning on those wide, soft boards.
""It floats like a boat,"" Adams said."
87,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2019 05:31AM ET</span>",Special Report: Rudderless rebellion - Inside the Hong Kong protesters' anarchic campaign against China,"By James Pomfret, Greg Torode, Clare Jim and Anne Marie Roantree
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ah Lung spends his days working as a clerk for a Hong Kong shipping firm. At night, he dons a mask, black helmet and body armor, and heads out into the streets to face off against the city's riot police.
The 25-year-old activist has been a constant presence at the often violent protests that have rocked Hong Kong this summer, rallying comrades, building barricades and rushing from district to district in a frantic game of cat-and-mouse with police.
Ah Lung, who would only identify himself by his nickname, which means ""dragon"" in Cantonese, is representative of a growing number of discontented young Hong Kongers who are fueling a protest movement that, unlike its predecessors, is taking aim directly at Beijing.
It is a movement without clearly discernible leaders or structure, making it difficult for the authorities to effectively target — and increasingly hard for the protesters themselves to manage. 
While it has the support of established pro-democracy groups, the amorphous movement is fueled by activists like Ah Lung – young Hong Kongers who operate independently or in small groups and adapt their tactics on the run.
""We're not so organized,"" Ah Lung said. ""Every day changes, and we see what the police and the government do, then we take action.""
""My dream is to revive Hong Kong, to bring a revolution in our time,"" Ah Lung said. ""This is the meaning of my life now.""
Through interviews with dozens of protesters like Ah Lung and reporting from dozens of protests, Reuters has pieced together a picture of how this movement functions and the mindset driving it.
'FREE HONG KONG'
The protests, which started as a peaceful rebuke of the Hong Kong government back in April, have evolved into a direct challenge to Communist Party rule over this former British colony. 
With slogans such as ""Free Hong Kong"" and ""Hong Kong is not China,"" Ah Lung and his fellow protesters have made clear they reject a future in which Hong Kong is inexorably absorbed into the mainland giant, eventually becoming just another Chinese city.
Protesters are provocatively calling the demonstrations an ""era of revolution,"" a formulation that has infuriated a ruling Chinese Communist Party determined to crush any challenge to its monopoly on power.
Scenes once unthinkable in Hong Kong are now commonplace: The city's international airport being shut down this week after a prolonged occupation by protesters; a Chinese official publicly suggesting that aspects of some of the protests were terrorism; the legislature stormed and ransacked by protesters; police officers repeatedly baton-charging crowds of protesters and unleashing torrents of tear gas in famed shopping districts.
On Tuesday, protesters who managed to shut down the airport also attacked a Chinese man for being a suspected undercover agent. He was identified as a reporter for the Global Times, a tabloid controlled by Beijing, highlighting how activists are making the Chinese government the target of their protests. 
It also brought another issue into focus: the risks of waging a leaderless rebellion. Demonstrators later apologized for the disruptions at the airport, apparently concerned that their chaotic protests might alienate broader sections of the Hong Kong public who had been supporting them.
""The movement has a large degree of self-restraint and solidarity, but of course that's very conditional,"" said Samson Yuen, a political scientist at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who has conducted surveys of protesters to understand their motives and support base. 
""If certain actions spin out of control, if say someone dies from it, then that might be a game-changer.""
ONE-COUNTRY, TWO-SYSTEMS
Under the ""one-country, two-systems"" formula, China promised Hong Kong it would enjoy autonomy for 50 years after its handover from Britain in 1997. 
Unlike those who negotiated the deal, for young protesters born after the handover that deadline will fall in the middle of their lives. And, as Beijing tightens its grip on Hong Kong, the future they see careening toward them is that of an authoritarian mainland China with curbs on the freedoms and rights they now enjoy.
""In 2047, if it returns to China, real Hong Kongers will leave and emigrate from Hong Kong,"" said Ah Lung, speaking in a small apartment in the Sham Shui Po neighborhood as he prepared for a night of protests that quickly descended into violence.
""By then, it won't be Hong Kong anymore, but Xiang Gang,"" he said, referring to the name commonly used on the mainland for Hong Kong.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said that protesters' calls for a revolution to ""liberate"" Hong Kong are illegal acts that challenge the authority of the central government in Beijing. 
In response to questions from Reuters about the protests, a spokesman for Lam referred to her promise to address income disparities in the city once the violence subsides.
The Hong Kong Liaison Office, Beijing's main representative arm in the city, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters.
The Hong Kong police did not respond to questions from Reuters. During the protests, police spokesmen have repeatedly defended the use of force and have pointed to escalating violence by protesters that has included throwing bricks and fire bombs.
LEADERLESS MOVEMENT
The protesters' mantra – ""Be water!"" – epitomizes the movement's tactics. A phrase borrowed from the Hong Kong movie star Bruce Lee, who used it to describe his kung fu philosophy, it is a call for flexibility and creativity, moving forward to press an advantage and pulling back when a strategic retreat is needed.
Its latest manifestation is the series of wildcat protests that have spread across the city in recent weeks. When police turn up in numbers at one protest, the activists often engage them, tying down officers before melting away and reappearing to stage a fresh protest in another area.
Pro-democracy protests that paralyzed much of downtown Hong Kong in 2014 involved blocking several key roads for more than two months. The more fluid tactics now being deployed by protesters, often masked to avoid surveillance and dressed in black, present a greater challenge for the police. Frontline officers speak of exhaustion, saying they never know where the activists will strike next.
Protesters say their movement is leaderless. In some ways, that's a reaction to the 2014 demonstrations in which many of the leaders were arrested and given prison terms. 
Unlike those protests, when leaders like Joshua Wong became globally recognized names, frontline activists like Ah Lung are deliberately staying under the radar, using pseudonyms and appearing at protests with their faces obscured by masks and sunglasses.
The leaderless nature of the protest movement is made possible, to a large extent, by social media.
Protesters take their cues from more than 100 groups on the instant messaging app Telegram, dozens of Instagram sites and online forums like LIHKG. The groups are used to post everything from news on upcoming protests to tips on dousing tear gas canisters fired by the police to the identities of suspected undercover police and the access codes to buildings in Hong Kong where protesters can hide.
It's not an issue of having ""no leader, it simply means that everyone is a leader,"" said one 22-year-old Hong Kong student based in Britain who helps run ""antielabhk,"" an Instagram page that includes details about protests that has amassed more than 50,000 followers. The student asked not to be named.
Ma, a 28-year-old university student who would only give her surname, said at a recent protest in the volatile Mongkok district that she had come after seeing recruitment appeals in a Telegram group. ""We were only notified or briefed today – like an hour ago,"" said Ma, as she handed out water to protesters.
THE FRONT LINES
A feature of the protests in recent weeks has been the sight of ordinary activists like Ah Lung, the shipping clerk, rallying other protesters.
In Sham Shui Po on Sunday, Ah Lung joined other masked ""frontliners"" as the protest began. Some used wrenches to loosen bolts on roadside fences, which were then shaken loose, bound with nylon ties, and formed into makeshift barricades against the police. 
Ah Lung, brandishing a Star Wars light saber he had bought at a toy shop, called out instructions on where to position the barricades. As they worked, other masked protesters used hand-held telescopes to track police movements.
The improvised, bottom-up nature of the protest movement is further evident in the scores of medics, some of them medical staff from local hospitals, who say they have turned up unprompted at protest sites to treat the wounded and administer saline solution to tear gas victims.
Kay, a 28-year-old medic who works in information technology and would only give her first name, said she prepared an emergency kit, including iodine, bandages, tourniquets and saline solution before every protest. 
""I was hit by a tear gas canister one time and then when I retreated to a safe spot, some people helped me. I felt touched, and I wanted to help some people back.""
While the protest movement may not have clearly identifiable leaders, it does have the backing of prominent pro-democracy activists and groups who have organized some of the demonstrations. In the past, they have led smaller, more orderly demonstrations that were not aimed so pointedly at the leadership in Beijing.
Reuters reporting shows there is a high degree of coordination among a small circle of these activists, many of whom participated in the 2014 protests that were sparked by Beijing's refusal to grant Hong Kong universal suffrage.
For instance, members of Demosisto, a party that advocates for greater democracy in Hong Kong, have been behind a number of demonstrations, some of which ended in violent clashes with riot police, according to the group's members.
Last month, Tobias Leung, a member of the party's standing committee, applied for police permission to stage a rally in the suburban district of Sha Tin. Leung's link to the protest wasn't immediately clear because he applied under the name of a local community group, according to Wong, the leader of Demosisto.
Wong and other prominent activists have been present at various demonstrations, sometimes close to the front lines. But they have struggled to impose leadership on the streets, with the protesters debating amongst themselves and consulting their phone groups on what action to take.
Along with other prominent democrats in the city, Wong has been seen at protests by Reuters being shouted down by activists who say they don't want the movement hijacked by any single leader or group.
""I'm quite happy people are saying we should not rely on any specific political leader to lead this movement,"" Wong told Reuters. 
Jailed independence activist Edward Leung, who is revered by many of the protesters, is currently serving a six-year sentence for rioting stemming from a protest in 2016.
Francis Lee, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who has written a book on Hong Kong social movements, describes the protests as an ""open source"" movement. Protesters often aggregate the best ideas in online groups and vote on courses of action, he said.
China has accused foreign countries of being behind the protests. Both Western and Asian diplomats in the city monitor the protests closely and some have been seen at events. Diplomats say this is part of their routine work. 
FRUSTRATIONS BOIL OVER
The protests erupted in late April over a bill proposed by Lam that would have allowed the extradition of defendants from Hong Kong to mainland China. Unlike the demand for universal suffrage, which fueled the 2014 protests, the extradition bill was seen as a specific, tangible threat by many Hong Kongers, galvanizing hundreds of thousands of people. 
Facing huge protests, Lam announced on June 15 that she was freezing the bill. 
That wasn't enough for many Hong Kong residents, many of whom flooded onto the streets in one of the largest protest marches ever seen in the city, largely organized by a coalition of civil society groups. The march brought together a diverse cross-section of Hong Kong society, including members of the city's politically conservative middle class.
A major turning point in the protests was an assault on July 21 on Beijing's Central Government Liaison Office – the most prominent symbol of China's authority in Hong Kong. 
Black-clad activists arrived at dusk at the glass-steel skyscraper that bears the red state seal of China above its entrance. As the crowd quickly swelled to thousands, some protesters hurled eggs at the building. Others used spray paint to scrawl the words ""Revolution of Our Time"" on the walls.
Some tried to neutralize surveillance cameras by targeting them with laser pointers. To roars of approval, protesters then lobbed black paint at the state seal of China.
""Carrie Lam has refused to listen to our concerns about Communist Party interference,"" said one 27-year-old protester who would only give his name as Paul, as he attached vials of anti-tear gas fluid onto his military style backpack. ""Now we have to send our message to the communists directly.""
The Liaison Office has since become the target of repeated protests.
Nick Tsang, a protester clad in a black balaclava and black clothes, was in a crowd that began congregating in a Hong Kong park on the afternoon of July 28. 
Tsang checked out a Telegram group to see where other protesters were going. One group of protesters splintered off and headed to the city's police headquarters, while another group branched out in the direction of the Causeway Bay shopping district. Later on, some backtracked toward the Liaison Office. Tsang followed them.
This time, the building was fortified with water-filled plastic barriers, and several battalions of riot police and other elite units. Liaison Office staff, meanwhile, had replaced the sullied state seal with a new one and encased it in a plexiglass box.
Following several hours of heated clashes in the streets around the Liaison Office, a rearguard of protesters, including Tsang, found themselves surrounded by police. With tear gas swirling, they made a run for the Hong Kong subway system and escaped onto a train.
""We can't retreat or the authoritarianism will worsen,"" said Tsang, referring to the Chinese government.
""This is not about me. This is for Hong Kong, my home city.""

88,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2019 05:25AM ET</span>",Invesco thrives in China as former executive Ross leads Trump's trade war,"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - The former investment company of U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been flourishing in China, even as he marshals billions of dollars' worth of punishing tariffs in America's deepening trade war.
U.S. money manager  Invesco Ltd  (N:IVZ) - for which Ross was a senior executive from 2006 until he joined Trump's cabinet in February 2017 - has become the top foreign manager of Chinese money in China over the past year through its joint venture Invesco Great Wall Management, according to research firm Z-Ben Advisors, leaping ahead of Switzerland's UBS (N:UBS). 
It is an unlikely success story that Invesco executives say has nothing to do with government policy, but is instead rooted in the company's decades' worth of relationships in China.
Invesco maintains managerial control of its joint venture there, despite Chinese ownership limits. Last year the joint venture secured a lucrative 2018 listing on a huge  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) money market platform, where its fund has amassed $14.1 billion in assets.
But American tariffs appear to have helped at least one Invesco steel investment in China, according to interviews and company disclosures. 
In late 2017, Invesco, through its private equity arm WL Ross & Co, took a lead role in restructuring bankrupt regional player Chongqing Iron & Steel (SS:601005) with China Baowu Steel Group, also known as Baosteel. The recapitalization of Chongqing was completed in January 2018, just months before the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on Chinese steel imports.
Chongqing reported a 71% increase in operating profit in 2018, according to company financial reports. The company said it benefited from reduced debt, Beijing's mandate to remove excess capacity, and rising global steel prices amid Trump’s tariffs.
Invesco and WL Ross & Co sold their equity stake in Chongqing in late 2018, realizing a 1.6 times return on investment in about 12 months, Invesco said. 
Four Rivers Investment Management, a joint venture led by WL Ross & Co and Baowu, China's largest steel producer by volume, took a 23.5% stake in Chongqing after the restructuring. Invesco and WL Ross & Co were listed as stakeholders in the partnership when Chongqing filed its annual report on March 29.
Four Rivers has up to $12 billion set aside for similar steel deals in China, according to  Morgan Stanley  analyst Rachel Zhang. She pointed out that given output limits, the only way for Chinese steel makers to grow is through mergers and acquisitions.
Ross founded New York-based WL Ross & Co in 2000, and it has operated as a unit of Invesco since 2006. Ross sold his Invesco shares in December 2017. He said he mistakenly thought he had sold the stock earlier, as he was required to do. 
""I discovered that the previously held stock had not been sold. I then promptly sold these shares,"" he wrote in a disclosure with U.S. government ethics officials.
When asked in June about Wilbur Ross' role in leading the United States' trade war with China, Invesco chief executive Martin Flanagan acknowledged he was uncomfortable talking about his former colleague. He said he had not talked to Ross or Karen Dunn Kelley, Invesco's former fixed-income chief, who now serves as Ross' top lieutenant at Commerce, in more than 18 months.
""We have mutually agreed to not spend time with one another just because of the potential perceived issue (of conflicts of interest),"" Flanagan said. ""I'm very sensitive about it and they are also.""
Ross was not available for comment. 
Operating profit from Invesco's joint venture in China rose 29% to $19.2 million in the second quarter from the previous three months, the company said on July 25. The company said the profit margin on the joint venture was more than 50%.
Invesco Great Wall also reported $35.2 billion in average assets under management at the end of June, 58% higher than nine months earlier. The company's overall Asia assets surged 13% to $118.6 billion during the first half of the year on net deposits from clients and market gains. 
But Invesco's overall operating profit, including assets outside China, dropped 91% in the second quarter after taking charges related to its May acquisition of OppenheimerFunds from MassMutual. 
DECADES IN THE MAKING
Although Invesco's Chinese steel bet may have gotten a lift from the Trump trade war, Invesco's executives say its winning play book in China took decades to write.
The company first invested and managed money there in the early 1990s, and has raced ahead of BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), Fidelity International, JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc (N:JPM) and Morgan Stanley (N:MS), among others.
Unlike most U.S. rivals, Invesco manages the joint venture with its Chinese partner, state-owned  Huaneng Power  International Inc (SS:600011). Each owns a 49% stake, but Invesco has management control.
""This structure enabled Invesco to operate inside a board which was evenly held by the Chinese and Invesco,"" said Peter Alexander, managing director of Z-Ben Advisors. ""The elevation of the CEO – appointed by Invesco – to the board tipped the scales and with it all but allowed Invesco to run the (joint venture) essentially as a subsidiary.""
Larger U.S. rivals typically do not manage the joint ventures they have with top-tier Chinese financial services companies.
""We didn't want to be part of a big bank or insurance company. We did not want to be overwhelmed and we wanted to be free of any conflicts,"" Andrew Lo, the head of Invesco's business in the Asia Pacific region, told Reuters in a telephone interview in July. 
""We wanted a relationship that allowed us to run the company and build the company from the start,"" he said. Huaneng brought deep contacts in Chinese business and political circles, while Invesco delivered money management and investment expertise, Lo said. 
The world's top banks and asset managers have been in China for years, too. But their joint ventures, and limited access to the mainland's explosive wealth management market, have been a source of frustration.
China is expected to end ownership limits for foreign investors in its financial sector in 2020, a year earlier than scheduled, to show the world it will keep opening up its markets, Premier Li Keqiang said last month.
In June 2018, Invesco Great Wall also scored a coup when its Jingyi money fund was selected to be on the Yu'e Bao money-market platform. Yu'e Bao is an online spare cash management platform integrated with Ant Financial's Alipay, one of China’s largest digital payment platforms. It has more than 500 million users, according to Ant Financial, a unit of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA).
Invesco CEO Flanagan declined to say how the fund was picked to be on the platform, but said it was related to the company's presence in China.
""It's literally decades of constant engagement and then you become an overnight success,"" he said.

But overall gains were not baked in as the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) said on Friday it was investigating a technical glitch, which delayed the open of the UK blue-chip FTSE 100 (FTSE) and FTSE midcap (FTMC) indexes.
China's state planner said it will roll out a plan to boost disposable income this year and in 2020 to encourage consumption as the economy slows.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was 0.7% higher by 0742 GMT, with the trade-sensitive DAX index (GDAXI) outperforming.
The benchmark index was still on pace to log a third straight week of losses, as mounting worries of a global recession sparked in part by the long-drawn U.S.-China trade war, kept investors on the edge.
Leading the charge on the STOXX 600 was a rally in semiconductor companies, which pushed the technology sector (SX8P) up 1.2% - with AMS (S:AMS),  Infineon Tech  (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) making substantial gains.
Better-than-expected results from gaming chip maker Nvidia (O:NVDA) and chip gear maker Applied Materials (O:AMAT) overnight helped reinforce the rally."
90,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Chipmakers, Banks Lead Modest Recovery Ahead of Weekend","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were on course for a happy ending to a volatile week Friday, as positive leads from Wall Street and Asia combined with suggestions of fiscal support measures from China combined to put a floor under equities.
By 5 AM ET, the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 1.1% at 368.94, while the German Dax and French CAC 40 were up 1.0%. They’re still all on course for a weekly loss, however.
The FTSE 100 was up a more modest 0.6%, reflecting a bounce in sterling on rising hopes that parliament will be able to stop a No-Deal Brexit through a vote of no confidence in the government of Boris Johnson, a measure that could theoretically be followed by the creation of a ‘government of national unity’.
Chipmaker stocks led the way, in the wake of better-than-expected quarterly results released late Thursday by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), which supported hopes that the slump in demand for high-performance chips could be ending. Germany’s Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn) rose 2.2%, while STMicroelectronics (A:STM) rose 0.7% and Dutch-based ASML (AS:ASML) rose 1.5%.
Banks were also prominent among the gainers after a torrid week. Spain’s largest banks all rose by between 1% and 1.5% and Germany’s Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) rose 3.3% and 1.5%, after both hitting new all-time lows this week on fears of endlessly low interest rates.
Markets derived some support from overnight comments from China’s state planning commission about a possible plan to support household incomes next year, which lifted Asian equities earlier.
The growing prospects for fiscal stimulus across the globe mean that there’s “still substantial potential for equities”,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Ulrich Stephan said in a note to clients.
He pointed to comments by European Central Bank governing council member Olli Rehn on Thursday stressing the need for the ECB to exceed market expectations when it delivers its long-awaited package of monetary easing measures in September.
Stephan also pointed to the increasing pressure within Germany for the government to abandon its principle of balanced budgets.
There has been growing talk of government investment packages to upgrade Germany’s environmental performance or its infrastructure, accompanied by various ideas on how and when to abolish a reunification-era surcharge on income tax. However, none looks close to fruition and the government is constrained by a constitutional amendment limiting the structural budget deficit to only 0.35% of gross domestic product."

The auditor, criticised by politicians for failing to flag problems at Northern Rock in audits prior to its failure in 2007, has been awarded a 16.5 million pound ($20 million) contract to manage UK Asset Resolution's (UKAR) remaining business, according to a government contract notice posted online.
The Financial Times first reported the PwC appointment, including criticism from a senior politician of the choice.
UKAR, owned by the British Treasury, was set up to manage more than 100 billion pounds of assets from the two failed lenders.
Following a string of asset sales, UKAR's balance sheet was slashed to 8 billion pounds by April this year and it was later able to repay the last of the 48.7 billion pound of state loans it used to fund the bailouts.
A UKAR spokesman said the organisation would retain responsibility for the holding company.
""Using the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU) process, we have agreed to outsource this work to PwC once UKAR has completed its objective,"" the spokesman said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese city-gas distributor  Shenzhen Gas  (SS:601139) will launch next week in southern China its first fully-owned terminal to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), a company executive told Reuters on Friday.
This will make Shenzhen Gas the second city gas distributor backed by a local government that owns an LNG import facility. The first was Shenergy Group, which opened an LNG import terminal in Shanghai in 2008.
Most of China's import terminals are owned by the dominant state-run oil and gas companies like China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) and PetroChina (HK:0857).
China is the world's third-largest natural gas consumer and second-largest LNG importer after Japan.
Qiu Lihua, general manager of Sino-Benny, a unit of Shenzhen Gas that will operate the terminal, said the new facility at Yantian port in the city of Shenzhen has an annual capacity of 800,000 tonnes of the super-chilled fuel.
""This will be our own facility that will be connected to the existing municipal grid that takes in piped gas from CNOOC and PetroChina,"" Qiu told Reuters over the phone.
The new LNG berth and an 80,000 cubic meter storage tank have been built next to an import facility for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a business that Sino-Benny has been in for years, said Qiu.
The first cargo of 65,000 cubic meters of LNG is to arrive at Yantian on Sunday, supplied by Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI) at a time when Asian spot LNG prices are near their lowest in nearly three years due to ample supplies and weak demand.
Qiu declined to comment on the price of the cargo but said his company is exploring taking regular supplies under a term contract of three to five years.
""As our berth is not of a standard size, we can't really rely on random spot supplies as the cargoes available may not fit our berth,"" he said.
The terminal is located about 10 km (6 miles) from the larger CNOOC-operated Dapeng LNG terminal, in which Shenzhen Gas has a minority stake.
Qiu expects natural gas demand in Shenzhen, a bustling city bordering Hong Kong, to maintain double-digit growth in the coming few years, led by residential use and power generation.
The number of households using piped natural gas will double by the end of 2020, from 2.1 million now, under a government-led switch from LPG canisters, said Qiu.
Following a gas supply crunch in the winter of 2017/2018, Beijing urged local governments and city-gas distributors to build storage facilities under a broad nation-wide campaign to boost the use of natural gas to cut pollution from coal."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares found some footing on Friday after a turbulent week as China hinted at more support for its economy, amid growing expectations of aggressive stimulus from all the major central banks.
Sentiment got a lift when China's state planner said Beijing would roll out a plan to boost disposable income, though details were lacking.
A bounce in U.S. and European stock futures also helped, with E-Minis for the S&P 500 and the EUROSTOXX 50 each rising 0.6%.
In early European trades, Germany's DAX futures added 0.7% as did futures for London's FTSE and France's CAC 40.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan responded by climbing 0.4%, though it was still down 1% for the week.
Japan's Nikkei recouped early losses to end a touch firmer at 0.06%, while Shanghai blue chips rose 0.3%.
""Tariffs remain the largest source of risk for equities,"" analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a note.
Beijing on Thursday vowed to counter the latest tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods.
""Existing U.S./China tariffs have weighed on corporate profits during 1H19 with S&P 500 companies delivering flat earnings growth compared to mid-single-digit trend rate prior to implementation of tariffs,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said.
They also downgraded estimates for 2020 earnings per share to $177 from $178 to account for the latest tariffs that will likely kick in on Sept.1.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he believed China wanted to make a deal and that the dispute would be fairly short, despite it already lasting more than a year.
With no settlement in sight, investors have hedged against a global slowdown by buying bonds. Yields on 30-year debt hit an all-time low of 1.916% on Thursday to be down 27 basis points for the week, the sharpest such decline since mid-2012.
That meant investors were willing to lend the government money for three decades for less than the overnight rate.
Such is the gloom that surprisingly strong U.S. retail sales came and went with no impact on the bond rally.
Analysts have cautioned that the current bond market is a different beast than in the past and might not be sending a true signal on recession.
""The bond market may have got it wrong this time, but we would not dismiss the latest recession signals on grounds of distortions,"" said Simon MacAdam, global economist at Capital Economics.
""Rather, it is of some comfort for the world economy that unlike all previous U.S. yield curve inversions, the Fed has already begun loosening monetary policy this time.""
CAVALRY COMING
Indeed, futures imply a one-in-three chance the Federal Reserve will chop rates by 50 basis points at its September meeting, and see them reaching just 1% by the end of next year.
There were plenty of other signs the cavalry were coming.
European Central Banker Olli Rehn on Thursday flagged the need for a significant easing package in September.
Markets are keyed for a cut in the deposit rate of at least 10 basis points and a resumption of bond buying, sending German 10-year bund yields to a record low of ‑0.71%.
""Notions that the package will include a revamped QE program also saw a sharp rally in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese debt,"" said Tapas Strickland, a director of economics at National Australia Bank.
""If the ECB undertakes such substantive stimulus, it is unlikely to do so alone given the upward pressure it would put on the U.S. dollar.""
Mexico overnight became the latest country to surprise with a cut in rates, the first in five years.
Canada's yield curve inverted by the most in nearly two decades, piling pressure on the Bank of Canada to act.
All the talk of ECB easing knocked the euro back to $1.1096 and away from a top of $1.1230 early in the week.
It was last down 0.1% at $1.1104, helping lift the dollar index up to 98.217 and off the week's trough of 97.033.
The dollar could make little headway on the safe-haven yen, though, and idled at 106.14 yen.
The collapse in bond yields continued to make non-interest paying gold look relatively more attractive and the metal held at $1,514.6, just off a six-year peak.
Oil prices were trying to bounce after two days of sharp losses. Brent crude futures added 65 cents to $58.88, while U.S. crude rose 62 cents to $55.09 a barrel."
94,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2019 03:52AM ET</span>",STAR Market tech board offers hope to Chinese venture capitalists,"By Samuel Shen and Julie Zhu
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - When Chinese venture capital firm New Vision Capital invested in two startups focusing on cloud computing and micro-optics, the plan was to eventually take them public on the Nasdaq exchange.
But with the launch of China's new STAR Market tech board - and an escalating trade war with the United States - partner Frederick Shen said it makes more sense to list loss-making DaoCloud and North Ocean Photonics in Shanghai.
""The trade war has quite a big impact,"" Shen said, adding that trade tensions inject uncertainty into valuations, financing and capital expenditure plans.
Listing closer to the investor base is also easier ""because there's no language barrier or time differences,"" Shen added.
STAR Market, which allows pre-profit companies to list in China for the first time, gives venture capitalists a new way to exit investments in loss-making start-ups. The sharp deterioration of the China-U.S. relationship has also nudged more Chinese companies to list at home.
""That trend may accelerate given the perceived risks associated with a U.S. listing as the trade tensions escalate,"" said Oliver Nip, Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Ropes & Gray.
The new market was launched as China's venture capital sector has been cooling. Beijing's deleveraging campaign hurt fundraising by local-currency funds, and a crackdown on shadow banking sapped liquidity. 
Venture capital and private equity firms in China raised just $5.5 billion in yuan-denominated funds in the first half of this year, according to data provider Preqin. That compares with $15.5 billion a year earlier, and $62.1 billion in the first half of 2017.
Bao Fan, chief executive of investment bank China Renaissance, a major player in China's tech sector, said that STAR Market ""is definitely positive"" for investors.
Offshore listings have not been easy for Chinese start-ups, he said, ""largely because a company needs to grow to a certain size to be attractive to offshore investors.""
Chinese venture capital firm Corner Stone Capital, which has backed a slew of Nasdaq-listed Chinese companies, is increasingly looking at STAR Market for listings.
Drugmaker Zelgen, backed by Corner Stone Capital, has scrapped a plan for a Nasdaq listing and applied in Shanghai. The developer of cancer medicines could become China's first listed firm with no revenue or profits. 
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YL16ag) 
DEBUT FANFARE 
STAR Market made its debut last month amid fanfare and investor enthusiasm. The first 25 companies on the board - ranging from chip-makers to healthcare firms - surged 140% on average on their first day of trading.
Venture capitalists are rushing to embrace the market as a means of returning profits to investors and attracting more funding.
But the boon is limited. The STAR Market only allows listings from a handful of industries with ""hard"" technologies such as AI, cloud computing, green energy and biotech. And VC investors generally must wait 12 months after listing before they sell shares. 
Andrew Qian, CEO of Shanghai-based New Access Capital, said STAR Market's launch has helped the venture capital sector thaw after a ""freezing winter"". 
New Access is planning more domestic listings by its portfolio companies, and is launching a tech fund targeting companies in sectors such as AI and 5G networks.
But Zhu Fuming, chairman of Shanghai-based Vstar Capital, cautioned that most venture capital funds may continue to struggle. 
With 14,000 venture capital and private equity competitors, ""consolidation will definitely accelerate this year,"" he told a forum in Shanghai recently. To survive, the remaining funds must focus on high-tech investments, he said.
SELF-SUFFICIENCY
Some analysts see STAR Market as China's boldest capital market reform yet aimed at luring tech listings away from New York or Hong Kong.
Since Washington blacklisted Chinese tech giant Huawei on May 16, overseas-listed Chinese companies have dropped around 8%, far underperforming the S&P index, which is roughly flat. 
""Many (Chinese) tech companies - either those listed in the U.S. or those thinking about listing in the U.S. - are concerned that they will be caught up in the conflict,"" said Xuong Liu, a China-based managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal. 
With valuations of U.S.-listed Chinese tech firms hurt by the trade war, Liu suggested Chinese venture capitalists ""re-consider their exit strategies."" 
Terence Lin, CEO of boutique investment bank World Financial Holding Group, said the trade war is a source of concern for Chinese companies seeking a U.S. listing: ""Nine out of 10 clients would ask me about this issue. It's on their minds.""
The U.S. market, however, remains appealing to many Chinese companies, thanks to its ample liquidity, regulatory transparency, and simple listing rules, Lin said.
Drew Bernstein, co-managing partner of Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, a leading auditor for Chinese companies listed in the U.S., agreed.

""If you are looking for the deepest capital markets, most sophisticated technology analysts, and ability to have offshore liquidity and a global brand, the U.S. markets remain a very compelling proposition,"" he said. ""But it requires a real commitment.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Buyout firms KKR (N:KKR), Blackstone (N:BX) and CVC are among bidders competing for a stake in the hospital unit of Philippines' Metro Pacific Investments Corp (PS:MPI), people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Metro Pacific Investments, which has interests in power, water and other sectors, has said it plans to sell a 40% stake in Metro Pacific Hospitals at a valuation of $2-$2.5 billion, marking the country's biggest healthcare deal.
The bidders are, however, valuing the hospital unit at about $1.5-$2 billion, pegging the valuation at 15 to 20 times next year's estimated core profit of the unit, the people said.
The stake in the unit, the operator of 14 hospitals, many of which are among the country's largest and most modern, has also attracted interest from other financial and strategic investors, the people said, declining to be named as the talks are private.
The interest in the subsidiary underscores a strong appetite for healthcare deals in emerging markets, which are benefiting from rising spending by a rapidly growing consumer class.
""There's no asset of this sort in the Philippines. So, if you are looking to get exposure to local healthcare, this is a good play,"" one private-equity executive said.
Metro Pacific Investments, which owns an 85.6% stake in the hospital unit and has said it plans to use the funds from the sale to expand this business, declined to comment.
More than half a dozen investors have submitted first-round indicative bids and could team up with other parties for their final offers, the sources said.
Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings is among those interested in the hospital unit, one person said.
KKR, CVC, Blackstone and Temasek declined to comment.
One of Temasek's portfolio firms is Sheares Healthcare Group, which invests and provides healthcare services in Asia, focusing on China, India, the Philippines, Indonesia and others.
Metro Pacific Investments is a unit of  First Pacific  Co Ltd (HK:0142), that is owned by Indonesian tycoon Anthoni Salim.
HEALTHCARE ASSETS IN PLAY
Sources said while majority control was not being offered in Metro Pacific Hospitals, some bidders were keen to take a bigger stake by setting up different shareholding structures at a later stage. The Philippines' 40% cap on foreign ownership will apply as the unit owns real estate.
Besides running hospitals, Metro Pacific Investments' hospital subsidiary operates a network of primary care clinics and cancer centers.
Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, which bought a 14.4% stake in the hospital unit in 2014, and has an option to boost its holding via an exchangeable bond, is open to paring its stake, the people said. GIC declined to comment.
The Philippine sale process comes months after the Asian hospital business of Columbia Pacific Management, estimated to be valued at $2 billion, was launched, other sources said.
The sale of Columbia Pacific's Asia hospital business attracted keen interest from many investors, but steep valuations for the portfolio of mid-sized medical facilities on offer, mainly in India and Malaysia, affected the process.
A buyout firm and a strategic buyer are expected to jointly acquire part of the Columbia Asia business at a lower-than-expected valuation, the sources added.
There was no reply from Columbia Pacific to a Reuters email sent outside U.S. opening hours.

99,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2019 02:06AM ET</span>",Weight of history: Chongqing Steel and China's state sector dilemma,"By David Stanway
CHONGQING, China (Reuters) - A year and a half ago, Chongqing Iron and Steel Corp (CISC) (SS:601005) (HK:1053), China's oldest steelmaker, was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy in a deal hailed as a shining example of how struggling state companies can be revamped.
Today it is profitable and earned 616 million yuan ($87.51 million) in net income in the first half of 2019.
Chongqing Steel's savior: Four Rivers Investment Management, a private equity fund established in August 2017 by China's biggest steel producer, Baowu Iron and Steel Group (SS:600019), or Baosteel, which aims to benefit from a state-driven consolidation of the industry. 
Involved in the fund is W.L. Ross & Co, a distressed asset specialist established by Wilbur Ross, the U.S. commerce secretary, who has backed tariffs against China's steel producers. The company has operated as a unit of Invesco since 2006, and Ross sold his shares in December 2017.
The ultimate aim is to make the firm an attractive takeover target, Four Rivers executives told Reuters. Baosteel will get first refusal rights starting at the end of next year.
""Some in the West used to call steel a sunset industry, but I want to tell everyone that there's no such thing as a sunset industry that is still increasing its assets,"" Four Rivers chairman Zhou Zhuping said in a speech last November.
W.L. Ross & Co has experience with distressed steel assets in the United States, buying bankrupt mills such as Bethlehem Steel, which it sold to Mittal, now ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, in 2002. 
Baosteel and Four Rivers expect China's steel industry to consolidate and reorganize. U.S. tariffs on steel could add pressure to those forces - and Chongqing Steel could benefit. 
China's oldest steel mill was founded in 1890 but its modern history began during China's war against Japan, when it was forced to move to the Yangtze River port city of Chongqing to flee invading troops. 
In recent years, it has struggled to compete in an increasingly crowded market, and by 2017 it was on the brink of shutting down before a rescue deal restructured 40 billion yuan of debt.
Though the company has since turned a profit, critics say the rescue mostly shows that well-connected state firms are too big to fail. 
""They have let a good company (Baosteel) carry a bad one on its back, and this is the way state-owned firms have been restructured for years,"" said Zhang Wuzong, a parliamentary delegate and chairman of the privately owned Shiheng Special Steel. 
DISLOCATION
Chongqing Steel's new management blamed the firm's plight on a 2006 government decision to move 60 miles north from an inner-city site to the rural district of Changshou. 
Relocation costs eventually hit 37.6 billion yuan, more than double the original estimate, saddling CISC with annual interest payments of more than 1 billion yuan.
As a specialty shipping plate manufacturer, the firm also faced much higher logistics costs than its rivals, and it was unable to meet local demand for the cold-rolled steel used by auto and home appliance manufacturers. 
""Its location is in Chongqing but its products were designed for coastal areas,"" said Yu Hong, a Four Rivers executive now serving as secretary of CISC's board of directors. 
Making matters worse, CISC had too much capacity when the 2008 global financial crisis sent steel demand into a tailspin. 
Even though it was operating at only a third of its capacity, the local government was urging it to expand further, with Chongqing's mayor, Huang Qifan, saying in 2011 it would aim to become a ""100-billion yuan enterprise"" within four years.
By 2015, China's steel market was entering its worst-ever slump, and in 2016 more than 70% of the country's mills were losing money. Efforts to switch to overseas markets led to dumping investigations in the United States and Europe, and raised risks of tariffs. 
Chongqing Steel suspended share trading in June 2016 and in 2017 it faced thousands of unpaid debt claims from suppliers. A former staff member told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the company looked ""beyond salvation."" 
""No one dared to take over this mess, because there was so much debt,"" said Four Rivers' Yu.
RESCUE
At the start of 2018, shareholders and creditors finally agreed a restructuring deal that cut CISC's debts from 20 billion yuan to 3.5 billion yuan and transferred unprofitable assets to the local government. 
After years of losses, CISC turned profitable in 2018. Its interim report this year singled out Baosteel's intervention as a key reason for the turnaround. 
Baosteel, the world's second-biggest steelmaker, will have the option to take over Chongqing Steel at the end of next year. The company expects to benefit from a state plan to put 60% of total capacity in the hands of its top 10 producers, up from about 40% now, and it has also been in talks to take over the smaller Magang Group. 
Executives admit CISC's upturn in fortunes came amid an improvement in the steel market, with prices revived by state efforts to shut down low-grade, polluting mills. The aim is to make the company sustainable even during downturns.
""What we want to build in ourselves is the ability to be competitive in the regional market, and when everyone is doing badly, it becomes a sector problem,"" CISC's chief executive Li Yongxiang told Reuters.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.6% and 0.9% by 11:23 AM ET (03:23 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.7%. 
China “has no choice but to take necessary measures to retaliate,” China’s State Council Tariff Committee said in a short statement on Thursday, without providing any specific measures. 
The U.S. imposed a new 10 per cent tariff on $300 billion of Chinese goods earlier this year. The additional tariffs were set to become effective in early September, but Trump announced that some tariffs against certain goods are now delayed until Dec. 15. 
Earlier this week, Trump appeared to have linked Hong Kong’s ongoing political unrest to trade talks with China and said he trusts Chinese leader Xi Jinping would want to solve the Hong Kong problem “quickly and humanely.”
“If President Xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters, there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem. I have no doubt!” the president tweeted. 
China responded by saying that they do not want external advice on how to deal with Hong Kong.
“Hong Kong is purely China’s internal affair. We have noticed that President Trump has previously said that ‘Hong Kong is part of China and they’ll have to deal with that themselves. They don’t need advice,”’ China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a written comments to a question about Trump’s tweet. 
“We hope that the U.S. side will do as what they say.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative David Cicilline urged Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai on Thursday to give the public the chance to comment on a draft order that would grant agency approval to the $26 billion merger of T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc and Sprint Corp.
Cicilline, chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, said in a statement Pai's order on Wednesday ""behind closed doors"" is rushing the merger that ""demands a thorough and transparent review.""
He urged the FCC to allow public comment on the proposed merger, which won antitrust approval from the Justice Department in July after the companies agreed to divest Sprint's prepaid businesses, including Boost Mobile, to  DISH Network  Corp (NASDAQ:DISH).
Consumer advocacy groups have raised concerns that the merger could raise the cost of wireless services.
An FCC spokesman said in a statement that ""the time has come for Commissioners to vote and for this proceeding to be brought to a close"" and that there have been ""multiple public comment cycles.""
The last public comment period ended in March - before the agreement with Dish was announced and before Pai issued his draft order.
Democratic FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said she was ""not convinced that removing a competitor will lead to better outcomes for consumers"" in a tweet on Wednesday and said the public should be able to comment before a vote.
The deal must still be approved by two of the other four FCC commissioners and it faces legal challenges from 16 state attorneys general."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Wednesday it was either directly or indirectly responsible for 2.4 million U.S. jobs, up 20% from the 2 million the technology company estimated in 2017.
The iPhone maker said its direct workforce grew from 80,000 to 90,000 in the 2-1/2 years since its last U.S. job estimate. But most of the estimated growth came from companies such as Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc which make parts in the United States for Apple products and from third-party software developers making apps for Apple devices.
App-related jobs totaled 1.9 million, up by 325,000 from its previous estimate, the Cupertino, California-based company said in a news post on its website.
Apple did not say how it arrived at its estimates or how the research was funded. Estimates of indirect job creation can vary widely depending on how the analysis is carried out.
Apple has faced criticism, including from U.S. President Donald Trump, for contracting factories to assemble most of its products in China. Apple has countered that it spent $60 billion on products and services from U.S.-based suppliers in 2018 and plans to increase that to $350 billion by 2023.
Apple said in December it would spend $1 billion to build a new campus in Austin, Texas, for up to 15,000 employees and that it was adding direct jobs in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City, California."
105,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 06:33PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Housing Market, Consumer Sentiment Data in Focus
Housing market numbers are on the calendar for Friday, with many eager to see whether weakness in homebuilder activity will continue even as lower mortgage rates are supposed to support demand. 
The Commerce Department will report on housing starts and building permits for June at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists expect that housing starts to rise to an annual rate of 1.257 million last month, up from a reported 1.253 million starts in June.
Building permits an indication of future demand, are forecast to show an increase to a rate of 1.270 million, up from 1.22 million units in June. Homebuilder confidence has been high this year because of low rates, and stocks of home builders have been strong performers as well. The iShares US Home Construction (NYSE:ITB) exchange-traded fund is up 29% this year. 
 
Consumer sentiment data is also expected to be closely watched for an insight into the strength of the US consumer. 
The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, due at 10:00 am ET. is forecast to show a reading of 97.2, down from the last month's reading of 98.4 while consumer expectations data will also be in focus. 
2. Rig Counts on Tap
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production, which remains close to record highs. 
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US fell by 6 to 764.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures on Thursday settled 1.4% lower at $54.47 a barrel. 
Oil prices fell further into the red on Thursday, following a 3% decline a day earlier as fears of a looming recession fuelled concerns about oil demand growth. 
3. Deere Earnings Due
Agricultural-and-construction-equipment maker Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) reports earnings before markets open on Friday. 
But the earnings report comes in the wake of a weaker farming backdrop, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier this week raising its corn supply numbers, sending corn futures prices tumbling. 
With farmers feeling the pinch from a decline in corn prices and ongoing U.S.-China trade war, major purchases of farming equipment may come under threat and muddy Deere’s guidance.
Deere, down 3.7% for the year, is expected to report earnings of $2.85 on revenue of $9.44 billion. "

""We believe that Berkshire's share price is likely to increase substantially over the coming years,"" Ackman wrote in a letter to clients one day after announcing in a filing that he had bought roughly $700 million worth of Berkshire stock."
107,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 05:45PM ET</span>",Stocks: S&P Rises After Wednesday Drubbing,"Investing.com - Stocks were mostly higher Thursday a day after recession fears caused one of the year's worst selloffs.
Better-than-expected earnings from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and a decent gain for Boeing (NYSE:BA) helped improve traders' moods.
The S&P 500 rose 0.29%. The Dow Jones industrials added 0.39%. But the Nasdaq Composite suffered a small loss, mostly because of weakness in Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
The market's performance was hardly an all-clear signal for the major averages.
The Dow gained about 100 points, but that was just 12% of the 800-point loss the index suffered on Wednesday, its worst one-day loss on the year and worst since Oct. 10, 2018. Plus, 95 points of the gain were due to Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) alone.
In addition, about half of the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 were lowe,r with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) the worst performer, with an 8.6% loss after guidance in Wednesday's earnings report disappointed investors.
Meanwhile, traditional retailers were hit hard again with Macy’s (NYSE:M) down 3.8%, Gap (NYSE:GPS) down 7.1%, and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) off 2.6%. 
  General Electric   (NYSE:GE) shares suffered an 11.3% loss to $8.01 -- and that wasn't even a 52-week low.
The stock slumped after Harry Markopolos, the forensic accountant famed for uncovering the Bernard Madoff scam, accused the company of accounting fraud in its handling of legacy long-term care insurance policies. The company dismissed Markopolos' claims as without merit and accused Markopolos of market manipulation. GE's percentage loss was its biggest since 2008.
With Thursday's close, the S&P 500 is off 5.9% from its late-July peak, but still up 13.6% for the year. The Dow is down 6.6% from the July high and ahead 9.7% in 2019, while the Nasdaq's decline from its peak stood at 6.9%. It ended the day up 17% for all of 2019.
A bright spot after hours was a 5.3% gain for shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after the graphics-chip maker reporter earnings and revenue that beat estimates. 
 
Oil prices were lower, with WTI crude falling 76 cents to $54.47 a barrel. Brent oil futures were off $1.41 to $58.07. Gold futures continued to climb, with the December contract settling at $1,531.10 an ounce.
The 10-2 Year Treasury Yield Spread widened slightly, although interest rates continued to fall. The 10-Year Treasury yield was 1.51%. The 2-Year yield was 1.484%.
Winners and Losers Among S&P 500 stocks
Scientific instrument company Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and distiller Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb) were among the top S&P 500 performers.

108,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 05:39PM ET</span>",GE shares fall on Madoff whistleblower calling its finances a fraud,"By Alwyn Scott and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) shares fell as much as 15% on Thursday after fraud investigator Harry Markopolos, who blew the whistle on Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, said GE was concealing deep financial problems, prompting a sharp rebuke from GE's new CEO.
Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said Markopolos' 175-page report contained factual errors and constituted ""market manipulation - pure and simple,"" because Markopolos stood to profit from short-selling tied to its release.
Short sales, or bets that a share price will fall, have risen 17% in GE stock over the past month to 110 million shares worth about $995 million before the report came out Thursday, said Matthew Unterman, a director at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm in New York. 
In the report http://www.gefraud.com, Markopolos accused GE of hiding $38 billion in potential losses and asserted that the company's cash and debt positions were far worse than it had disclosed.
""GE's true debt to equity ratio is 17:1, not 3:1, which will undermine its credit status,"" Markopolos said.
The report also says GE is insolvent and asserts that its industrial units have a working capital deficit of $20 billion.
""He is selectively front-running widely reported regulatory processes and rigorous investigations without the benefit of any access to GE's books and records,"" GE board member and audit committee chair Leslie Seidman said in a statement, referring to Markopolos. 
While investors sent GE shares sharply lower, the report echoes the assertions of some of Wall Street's more skeptical analysts, who have long raised alarms about GE's low cash flow, frequent accounting charges and writedowns, and what they describe as opaque financial reports. 
Culp, the first outside leader of the company who took over in October, has made no secret of its woes. 
The industrial businesses have seen a $2.2 billion cash outflow so far this year, and Culp said last month that GE may incur cash costs of $1.4 billion this year from the grounding of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX jetliner. GE makes engines for the jet through a joint venture with  Safran  SA (PA:SAF) of France.
The report alleges that GE faces $38 billion in future expenses that it has not disclosed. ""GE's $38 billion in accounting fraud amounts to over 40% of GE's market capitalization, making it far more serious than either the Enron or WorldCom accounting frauds,"" the report says.
In a statement GE said, ""We remain focused on running our business every day and ... will not be distracted by this type of meritless, misguided and self-serving speculation.""
GE said it ""stands behind its financials"" and operates to the ""highest-level of integrity"" in its financial reporting. 
It also said Markopolos was known to work for unnamed hedge funds that typically benefit from short-selling a company's stock.
BACKED BY A HEDGE FUND 
A disclaimer in the report stated that it was drafted by Forensic Decisions PR LLC, which will get compensation from a third-party entity that could benefit from a decline in GE's share price. The report did not name the entity.
Speaking on CNBC on Thursday, Markopolos said he would receive a percentage of any profits generated by the report. He declined to provide details about the compensation or name the fund involved, which he said was ""a mid-sized U.S. hedge fund.""
GE shares closed down 11.3% at $8.01 on Thursday, its biggest one-day percentage drop since April 2008.
A regulatory filing showed CEO Culp bought GE shares worth nearly $2 million in open market purchase at an average price of $7.93 per share. (https:// In the past two years, GE has announced more than $40 billion in asset writedowns and accounting charges. The company also has said its accounting is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. The report details GE's exposure to long-term care insurance, the subject of a federal class-action lawsuit awaiting a decision on GE's motion to dismiss.  It says GE's financial statements about its insurance business do not correspond to those of eight insurers that Markopolos says hold about 95% of GE's exposure. Markopolos is best known for alerting regulators in the early 2000s to signs that money manager Madoff's investment firm was a Ponzi scheme, a deception in which unusually high returns for early investors are generated with money from later investors. Madoff was arrested in 2008 and later sentenced to 150 years in prison. John Hempton, co-founder of the Sydney, Australia-based Bronte Capital hedge fund, wrote in a blog post https://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-flat-out-silly-markopolos-ge-report.html on Thursday that GE's 14.7% average profit margin in recent years was in line with the returns of its industrial peers, not ""too good to be true"" as Markopolos alleges.  ""GE remains the unequivocal leader"" in medical imaging and jet engines and its currently depressed profit margin will likely rebound, he wrote, adding, ""Harry's report is silly. The market should ignore it."" Worried investors jangled phones on Wall Street Thursday. Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Baird & Co, said questions focused on $18.5 billion of the $38 billion in charges that Markopolos says GE is concealing.  Markopolos said GE will need to set aside that money to cover its long-term care policies in addition to the $15 billion it has already begun to set aside. Heymann said the remainder of the $38 billion was already largely known: charges related to an accounting rule change coming in 2021 and potential losses on GE's 50.4% stake in subsidiary Baker Hughes, which it plans to sell. ""I don't know the validity of the $18.5 billion,"" Heymann said. ""I'm trying to figure it out."" 
But he said if the figure was accurate, Culp would not have recently raised GE's 2019 financial targets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Walmart Inc (N:WMT) reported strong second-quarter results and raised its earnings expectations for the year, temporarily sidestepping concerns around consumer demand in the wake of tariffs on imports from China.
Walmart's performance was helped by shoppers who spent more at its stores and websites, indicating the U.S. consumer economy has not lost steam, sending its shares up 6.1% to close at $112.69.
The world's largest retailer posted a 20-quarter, or five-year, streak of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retail chain.
On Wednesday, Macy's Inc (N:M) lowered its annual earnings outlook amid worries over tariff-related price hikes and the resultant impact on demand. On Thursday, JC Penney (N:JCP) posted a 9-percent drop in sales.
Analysts said the contrast in performance indicates there is no evidence to suggest a broad drop in demand in the economy and retailers posting lower growth need to improve their business strategies.
U.S. retail sales surged in July, which could help to assuage financial markets' fears that the economy was heading into recession.
Consumers are responding to the changes the company is making to its business and the company is gaining market share, Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in a statement. Walmart gained share in grocery and general merchandise categories this quarter, the company said.
The retailer gets 56% of its revenue from food and grocery sales, which allows it to manage the pressure from tariffs better than many rivals, analysts said.
In an interview on Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said Walmart has raised prices on some items due to these tariffs, but it is not passing all the cost pressure it faces to consumers.
It is managing that by negotiating with suppliers and sourcing from alternate supply bases, he said.
""We still feel good about the consumer overall,"" Biggs said.
The company said it has expressed to the Trump administration that it wants negotiations with China to continue and communicated how this move impacts consumer and prices.
""We understand that free trade also has to be fair trade,"" Dan Bartlett, executive vice president of corporate affairs, told reporters on a conference call.
A Walmart shopping trip was 5.2% more expensive in June than a year earlier, according to Gordon Haskett Research Advisors, which compared prices on a basket of about 76 identical items over the past year.
U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10% earlier this year, a move that has begun pushing up prices of thousands of products including clothing, furniture and electronics.
Earlier this week, Trump backed off his Sept. 1 deadline for imposing 10% tariffs on remaining Chinese imports, delaying duties on cellphones, laptops and other consumer goods, to shield U.S. holiday sales.
The move offered relief to the retail industry but will do little to mitigate the impact on consumers during the holiday season. Most retailers have purchased their holiday-season merchandise, and the inventory has for the most part already arrived at U.S. ports and warehouses.
NO CHANGE IN GUN SALES POLICY
Walmart has also come under growing pressure and criticism over its policy to continue selling firearms after two mass shootings, one at its store, killed 31 people in Texas and Ohio.
The retailer said its policy to sell guns has not changed.
It said it has about 2 percent of the market for firearms and is not among the top three sellers. It has a 20 percent share of the ammunition market.
""We’re encouraged that broad support is emerging to strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger,"" Chief Executive Doug McMillon said.
McMillon said ""reauthorization of the assault weapons ban should be debated to determine its effectiveness in keeping weapons made for war out of the hands of mass murderers.""
Walmart's Bartlett said it has also made clear that employees can express their concerns on gun sales and no employee's job was in jeopardy for doing so.
A junior Walmart employee in California began a petition protesting the sale of firearms that gathered over 50,000 signatures. His access to Walmart's emails and messaging systems was temporarily blocked.
Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 2.8%, excluding fuel, in the quarter ended July 31. Analysts estimated growth of 2.07%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.27 per share, beating expectations of $1.22 per share.
The retailer raised its forecast for adjusted earnings-per-share to a ""slight decrease to slight increase,"" from a ""decline by a low single-digit percentage range."" That forecast includes the effect from the acquisition of Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart.
Online sales surged 37%, in line with the previous quarter's increase and higher than the company's expectation of 35%.
Walmart’s online expansion has come at a cost to profitability and losses at the U.S. e-commerce business could rise to about $1.7 billion this year from $1.4 billion in 2018, according to estimates from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Walmart is looking to sell ModCloth, the women’s apparel site it acquired two years ago, as it looks for ways to pare losses at its online business.
Total revenue rose 1.8% to $130.4 billion, beating analysts' estimates for $130.1 billion."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow gained ground in a late rally on Thursday as upbeat retail sales data offset recessionary fears amid the simmering U.S.-China trade tensions.
Wall Street zig-zagged from red to black and back much of the day as investors juggled mixed messages of a strong consumer and dropping U.S. Treasury yields.
The Nasdaq closed lower, weighed by a plunge in the shares of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO).
""You've an environment where we're digesting the move down in interest rates and the yield curve yesterday,"" said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Wealth and Investment Management in New York. ""Volume is lighter today. You're not getting outsized movements one way or the other.""
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc beat second-quarter analyst estimates and raised its full-year earnings outlook, sending shares of the world's largest retailer up 6.1% and soothing concerns about waning consumer demand.
Those concerns were further eased when retail sales data surpassed analyst expectations. Consumers, who account for about 70% of the U.S. economy, stepped up their spending across the board in July, according to the Commerce Department.
""One thing the market took solace in today is better U.S. economic data,"" Cronk added. ""That helped to calm some of the fears from yesterday."" 
Other economic data was less sanguine. Manufacturing output shrank more than expected in July, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve, and new claims for unemployment benefits came in above economist forecasts.
Belligerent rhetoric kept U.S.-China trade tensions at a low boil, as China vowed it would counter the last round of tariffs on Chinese imports and called on the United States to meet it halfway, while U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview any deal must be made ""on our terms.""
The prolonged escalation of the trade war between the world's two largest economies and the economic fallout have vexed global markets for months and have begun to drag on some companies' top lines.
Impending U.S. tariffs weighed on Cisco Systems, which plunged 8.6% after reporting a 25% drop in China sales and set sales and revenue forecasts well below analyst estimates. 
Trade tensions also sent the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield to a record low and the benchmark 10-year yield to a three-year trough.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 99.97 points, or 0.39%, to 25,579.39, the S&P 500 gained 7 points, or 0.25%, to 2,847.6, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.32 points, or 0.09%, to 7,766.62.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, six closed the day in positive territory, with consumer staples enjoying the largest percentage gain.
Shares of JC Penney Co Inc surged 2.2% after the struggling department store operator posted a smaller quarterly loss than analysts estimated.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co shares dropped 11.3% on the heels of a report from whistleblower Harry Markopolos accusing the conglomerate of hiding $38.1 billion in potential losses and claiming its cash situation was far worse than disclosed.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and 59 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 23 new highs and 282 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.72 billion shares, compared with the 7.53 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Midwest bankers reported that the percentage of farm loans their customers are having problems repaying hit a 20-year high in the second quarter this year, according to a survey released on Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
Farm incomes also dropped for the period, as record floods devastated a wide swath of the Farm Belt and the trade war between the United States and China entered a second year.
""The portion of the District’s agricultural loan portfolio reported as having 'major' or 'severe' repayment problems (6.2%) had not been higher in the second quarter of a year since 1999,"" the report said.
That drop in farm incomes also weighed on farmland values, which were down 2% for the quarter after being adjusted for inflation, according to the survey of 157 bankers across the 7th Federal Reserve District. The district encompasses Iowa, parts of northern Illinois and Indiana, southern Wisconsin and the lower peninsula of Michigan.
The state with the biggest price dip in the second quarter, Iowa, was down as much as 3% in some areas.
The district-wide dip was the first year-over-year decline since the third quarter of 2017, according to the report. But bankers did say they expect farmland values will stabilize, at least in the short term.
Bankers reported that while farmer demand for operational and other non-real estate farm loans was higher in the quarter than a year earlier, ""the availability of funds for lending by agricultural banks was lower.""
The reason, according to the Fed's report, is that banks had fewer funds available to lend in the second quarter of 2019 than a year ago.
Bankers also said nearly 70% of their farm customers were either significantly or modestly affected by the flooding and other adverse weather earlier this year - particularly in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.
The floods added more pain for farmers who have also been hurt by low crop prices and the trade war between Washington and Beijing, which has slashed shipments of U.S. agricultural products to China.
Due to the wet planting conditions this spring, bankers are expecting poor corn and soybean yields from their farmer customers this fall. The trade war is also expected to keep prices low, bankers said.
""It seems unlikely that these prices will rise enough to compensate for lost output, so the profitability of many corn and soybean farms will almost surely fall from their 2018 levels - possibly by a lot for some,"" the report said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) are bumping thousands of passengers off airplanes after their Boeing 737 MAX fleet's was grounded in mid-March following two fatal crashes.
The Federal Aviation Administration reported Thursday that American denied seats to 69,924 passengers voluntarily in the first six months of 2019, up from 28,409 in the same period last year, while involuntarily denying boarding to 5,022 passengers, up from 678 in the same period last year.
Southwest denied seats to 22,364 people voluntarily through June, compared with 10,364 in the first half of 2018, while it involuntarily denied boarding to 2,525, up from 1,045 in the first six months of 2018.
The FAA noted the airlines told the agency ""the grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft has negatively impacted their involuntary denied boarding statistics.""
American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said the airline's ""biggest challenge in the operation continues to be out of service aircraft. This reduces our ability to start the day right and to swap aircraft when needed as the day goes on.""
American has canceled about 115 daily flights into early November because of the ongoing grounding. It has been substituting other aircraft for its busiest flights while canceling others and temporarily suspending direct flights between Oakland, California, and Dallas-Fort Worth.
Some analysts have said they do not expect the MAX jets to fly again before the end of the year. American, with 24 of the 737 MAX aircraft and dozens more on order, is scheduling without the jets through Nov. 2.
Southwest has removed the aircraft from its scheduling through Jan. 5, 2020 and last month said it was ending operations at Newark Liberty International airport.
Southwest said in a statement that it does not oversell flights but that ""there were times that we had to down gauge a 175-seat MAX to our 143-seat 737-700 or try and accommodate customers on already-full flights.""
The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March after an Ethiopian Airlines plane plunged to the ground soon after take-off, five months after a similar Lion Air fatal crash off the coast of Indonesia.

Boeing (N:BA) hopes a software upgrade and new pilot training will add layers of protection to prevent erroneous data from triggering a system called MCAS, which was activated in both the planes before they crashed. Boeing hopes to conduct a certification test flight in the ""September time frame,"" a key step before the FAA can unground the planes.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 1.45% by 2:22 p.m. ET, underscoring a general malaise seen across chip stocks as rising US-China trade battles continued to spook chip investors. Nvidia is a key player in graphics chips used in games, artificial intelligence applications and related products.
Nvidia shares have struggled this month, falling some 12.3%. The shares are still up about 10.8%.
China earlier today warned the U.S. that it stands ready to hit back with ""countermeasures"" if Washington goes ahead with proposed tariffs not delayed and go into effect Sept. 1.
“China will have to take the necessary countermeasures,” China’s Ministry of Finance said in a statement. 
For Nvidia, the warning shot from China does little to justify the cautious optimism from Wall Street on the outlook of the chipmaker's gaming segment, which makes up the bulk of total revenue, ahead of its quarterly results due after closing bell. 
""We expect Nvidia to signal a return to a normalized gaming environment,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a recent note. 
Earlier this week, Wedbush also lavished praise on the company's gaming sector. 
“Fiscal second-quarter gaming revenues, as well as NVDA's fiscal third-quarter forecast, are likely to meet or exceed estimates in our view in light of modest expectations,” Wedbush said. 
Nvidia is expected to report earnings of $1.14 a share on revenue of $2.55 billion.
Along with Nvida, other semiconductor stocks struggled. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) were in the red, though off session lows. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was off 0.7%. mirroring weakness in Nasdaq stocks.
Broadcom's losses were exacerbated by a downgrade from Daiwa Securities to neutral from a buy. The brokerage also cut its price target on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to $290 from $345. "

The commission said the companies' goal was to narrow the price spread between the December 2011 and deferred-month wheat futures contracts, causing the market to sell cash wheat to the companies at lower prices, while earning them a profit on their speculative futures positions.
Wheat futures and options traders had also accused the companies of illegally manipulating the grain's price at their expense. 

The penalty is about three times the companies' alleged gain, the CFTC said in a statement.

124,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 01:41PM ET</span>",China bought U.S. pork last week as Beijing declared halt in U.S. farm purchases,"By Tom Polansek and Karl Plume
CHICAGO (Reuters) - China made its biggest purchases of U.S. pork in seven weeks last week as Beijing said Chinese companies suspended purchases of American agricultural products, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data issued on Thursday.
The world's largest pork consumer bought 10,211 tonnes of U.S. pork between Aug. 2-8 for shipment in 2019 as a highly contagious swine disease continued to ravage the Chinese hog herd.
China's Commerce Ministry said on Aug. 5 that Chinese companies stopped buying U.S. farm products in the latest escalation of the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
It was not clear if the purchases were made in the days before Aug. 5 or after.
The sales are a sign that China needs meat from the U.S. to offset the deaths of millions of pigs in an outbreak of African swine fever, analysts said.
""It was a new booking, which is positive,"" said Steve Meyer, economist for U.S. commodity firm Kerns and Associates.
China last year imposed retaliatory tariffs that remain in place on imports of U.S. farm products in the trade row, including duties of 62% on American pork.
The tariffs have slashed exports of U.S. crops including soybeans and sorghum and prompted the Trump administration to compensate American farmers for losses over two years with as much as $28 billion.
U.S. President Donald Trump this week backed off part of a plan for 10% tariffs on effectively all remaining Chinese imports beginning Sept. 1. China on Thursday vowed to counter the latest U.S. tariffs.
Although China has not made any new purchases of grain since suspending buying earlier this month, grain and soybeans bought before trade tensions escalated have continued to be loaded on boats and shipped to China.
The USDA confirmed that a China-bound shipment containing 53,788 tonnes of U.S. sorghum previously sold to an undisclosed buyer was loaded on the vessel Nord Summit at the Texas Gulf last week.
Another 25,000 tonnes of the grain sold to China in late July for shipment in September or later was rolled to the current marketing year, indicating that it would load and ship this month.
U.S. exporters also shipped 599,342 tonnes of previously purchased soybeans to China in the week ended Aug. 8 in the largest week of shipments since late February, according to USDA data."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. 30-year Treasury yields fell to a record low below 2% and benchmark 10-year notes dropped to a three-year trough on Thursday amid persistent worries about global trade tensions and economic slowdowns around the world.
A day after inverting, the U.S. yield curve steepened a little. Curve inversion, which occurs when long-term yields dip below short-term ones, is widely considered a warning that the economy is headed for recession.
""I don't think we have seen a bottom in yields yet,"" said Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth Management, in Boston.
""We'll likely have a reaction from the Federal Reserve at the next meeting. That could be something that fuels further moves lower in parts of the yield curve depending on how aggressive a stance they take.""
Data showing U.S. retail sales increasing by more than expected last month pushed yields a little higher from their lows. The retail numbers suggested fairly robust consumer spending that should help ease worries about a potential U.S. recession.
U.S. retail sales rose 0.7% in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 0.3%. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 1.0% last month after advancing by an unrevised 0.7% in June.
Other economic reports were not so upbeat, with initial jobless claims worse than expected and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions data having mixed details.
But the market's focus has been on retail sales.
In morning trading, yields on the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note (US10YT=RR) were last down at 1.558%, from 1.581% late on Wednesday.
Yields on 30-year bonds, which fell earlier from fresh record lows at 1.941%, were last at 2.0% (US30YT=RR) from 2.027% on Wednesday.
At the short end of the curve, U.S. 2-year yields fell to 1.54% from Wednesday's 1.577% (US2YT=RR).
The spread between 2-year and 10-year note yields widened a bit on Thursday at 1.8 basis points .
Wednesday's inversion of this yield curve roiled financial markets because of implications about a possible recession.
Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura, said the probability of recession has increased, but was not at an acute level. He cited mitigating factors such as the fact that many of the risks to the U.S. economy are from outside the country, although that didn't make it immune to external shocks.
""At this point, we think the risk of a U.S. recession over the next 12 months is somewhat elevated because the economy is slowing and because of a range of risks,"" Alexander said."

134,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 12:33PM ET</span>",Stocks Swing at Open as Data Fail to Banish Recession Fears,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets swung sharply at the opening on Thursday after weaker-than-expected industrial data poured cold water on a market that had appeared ready to rebound on signs that the U.S. consumer is still in good health.
Industrial production and manufacturing output both fell in July, disappointing hopes for a modest increase and focusing participants’ minds on the risks of a recession – the same risk that had handed the market its worst one-day losses in 2019 on Wednesday. Earlier manufacturing surveys from the Empire State and Philly Fed had also pointed to activity weakening, albeit not by as much as feared.
Wall Street had seemed set for a firmer opening after the Commerce Department said retail sales rose by 0.7% in July, more than double the 0.3% increase expected, and the strongest monthly increase since March.
The figures suggested that private consumption, which is the largest component of the U.S. economy, remains in good shape thanks to historically low jobless levels and steadily rising wages.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 80 points, or 0.3% by 10:05 AM ET (1405 GMT) in response to the data, although that was only a fraction of the 800 points that it shed on Wednesday, its worst day this year.
The S&P 500 rose 9.1 points or 0.3% while the Nasdaq 100 rose 14.5 points or 0.2%.
Analysts were at pains to play down the bond market contortions that had triggered Wednesday’s selling.
Mark Haefele, chief investment officer with UBS, said that the yield curve inversion – in which 10-year Treasury yields fell below 2-year ones – may not be the inevitable herald of a recession that many fear, especially if the Federal Reserve meets expectations by cutting short rates to restore the curve’s normal upward slope.
“Neither does a yield curve inversion indicate it is time to sell equities,” Haefele said in a blog post. “Since 1975, after an inversion in the 2-year/10-year yield curve, the S&P 500 has continued to rally for nearly two years, and has risen by 40% on average until hitting a bull market peak.”
Among individual stocks, there was confirmation of the strong consumption trend at company level: Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shares surged at the open after it reported a stronger-than-expected quarter ending in July. U.S. online sales surged 37% on the year, with the company noting particularly strong growth in grocery sales. Overall sales rose 2.9% in currency-adjusted terms, while operating profit fell due to the incorporation of its Indian acquisition Flipkart.
Elsewhere,   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) slumped over 6.4% after Harry Makropolos, a whistle-blower famous for exposing the Ponzi scheme of the late Bernie Madoff, accused it of creative accounting to prop up the company’s market value as it wrestles with a major turnaround.
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), meanwhile, fell 7.3% after saying after the bell on Wednesday that its sales growth would slow to a crawl in the current quarter due to slowing business in China and, to a degree the U.K. under the impact of trade disputes and Brexit uncertainties."

136,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 12:21PM ET</span>","J.C. Penney quarterly loss halves, sales still fall amid turnaround","By Aishwarya Venugopal and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday, as the department store operator's efforts to cut costs and shutter unprofitable businesses paid off, sending shares of its penny stock higher by as much as 14%.
The 117-year-old retailer, one of the worst-hit by the surge in online shopping in the past decade, reaffirmed it expected positive free cash flow this year and would have funds of around $1.5 billion available at the end of 2019.
Last month, Reuters exclusively reported that the company had hired advisers to explore debt restructuring options. 
The Plano, Texas-based retailer also gave a forecast for 2019, the first full-year outlook it has given since withdrawing its 2018 expectations in November to give new Chief Executive Jill Soltau time to settle in.
Penney's sales continue to fall, down 9% in the quarter, and it forecast that comparable sales would drop in 2019 between 7% and 8%, worse than current analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv data. 
But the company's net loss more than halved, to $48 million, compared with the same period a year ago, and Soltau said the company was benefiting from a reduction in excess inventory and reining in permanent price markdowns.
""While we still have work to do on our topline, I strongly believe that growing sales in an unprofitable way is simply not an option,"" she said.
The company announced on Thursday it would start selling secondhand women's clothing and handbags at 30 stores in partnership with fashion resale marketplace thredUP, starting this week.
""With the exponential growth in resale, there's no doubt that demand for affordable luxury is at an all-time high,"" Soltau said. ""There's an emotional thrill that comes with finding a high-quality, secondhand products for much less.""
Rival Macy's Inc (N:M) also announced a partnership with resale company thredUP a day prior, underscoring how department stores are aiming to reach a new and younger customer in fresh ways. 
Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said Penney's improvement in gross profit margin, which rose to 39.5% from 35.3% a year ago, was ""the big upside surprise in the quarter – led by lower markdowns, better shrink control, and overall better merchandise margin rates,"" adding that ""these factors should trump the top-line weakness, which is partly self-inflicted."" 
To stem falling sales, boost margins and ultimately reassure investors it can lure shoppers back into stores amid fierce competition from online giants like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and discount retailers like TJX Cos Inc's (N:TJX) Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains, Soltau has been reducing inventory at stores and closing underperforming outlets. 
Earlier this year, Soltau chose to stop selling major appliances and furniture in store, re-focusing on the retailer's once-thriving and higher-margin apparel business.
Fine jewelry, women's and men's apparel and footwear outperformed in the second quarter, ended Aug. 3, the company said, while women's accessories underperformed.
Soltau, hired late last year from craft and fabrics seller Jo-Ann Stores, told investors on a post-earnings call the ongoing trade spat between the United States and China has had ""minimal impact"" on the business thus far, and that Penney has and will continue to diversify its sourcing and reduce its exposure to China. 
Excluding items, Penney posted a loss of 18 cents per share, lower than estimates of 31 cents.
Penney ended the quarter with liquidity of about $1.70 billion.
Shares in the company have fallen 45% this year as of Wednesday's close. On Thursday, they were up 4% at $0.59 in afternoon trade.

Last week, the New York Stock Exchange said Penney had six months to get its stock price above $1 or its shares could be de-listed.

(Reuters) - Burford Capital (L:BURF), the litigation funder embroiled in a stand-off with short-seller Muddy Waters, on Thursday replaced its chief financial officer after investors raised concerns about her marriage to the CEO.
Burford said Elizabeth O'Connell would be replaced by Jim Kilman, a former vice chairman of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Banking, with immediate effect, a search would begin for two new independent board directors and Chief Executive Christopher Bogart would join the board ""in due course"".
Kilman would ""buttress confidence in Burford's financial disclosures"" and guide the company as it explores a dual listing in the United States -- or a listing on London's blue-chip market if a transatlantic market debut is too challenging, Burford said.
""Mr. Kilman has agreed to serve for up to two years as CFO and the board, once reconstituted ..., will take up succession planning for the CFO role as a priority,"" Burford said.
The company's beleaguered stock, which plunged more than 50% after Muddy Waters issued a report last week challenging its accounts, pared further losses and climbed 12.42 percent to stand at 880.75 pence by 1540 GMT.
But Muddy Waters, founded by Carson Block -- an American who built up his reputation by alleging fraudulent activities at Chinese firms he targeted -- called the notion that Kilman would improve governance ""a farce"".
""It is clear from this that Burford is more interested in imposing fig leaves than real guard rails,"" the hedge fund said in a statement. ""We note Mr. Kilman was Burford's principal investment banker at Morgan Stanley...""
""Burford investors would be much better served by a CFO from the outside..."""

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) expects minimal cancellations with affected passengers flying out at different times if pilots in Britain and Ireland go ahead with a two-day strike next week, the airline's chief people officer said on Thursday.
Ryanair staff unions in Ireland, Britain, Spain and Portugal have announced plans to strike in the coming weeks, a year after an initial wave of strikes over pay and conditions forced it to cancel hundreds of flights and hit its profits.
Members of its British pilot union, which the airline said represents half of its pilots there, voted last week to stage a two-day strike from Aug. 22, when directly employed pilots in Ireland also plan a strike.
Unionized Irish pilots represent less than half of Ryanair's pilots in its home market.
""Our hope is that we're going to cover the majority of the operation both in the UK and Ireland, and unless you hear from us, your flight is going ahead as normal,"" Eddie Wilson told Reuters in a telephone interview, adding that planned action by Portuguese cabin crew next week would be minor.
""We'll be protecting as a priority the summer destinations and there may be some cancellations on multi-frequency routes between Ireland, the UK or on UK domestics where people can make free changes, etc. There will not be travel chaos.""
""OFF THE WALL""
Responding to the British Airline Pilots Association's call on Thursday to meet for mediated talks to resolve the dispute on pay and benefits, Wilson said Ryanair was still waiting on the union to reply to a legal letter stating it had to re-engage directly first, as per a deal struck last year.
Mediated talks broke down on Wednesday in Ireland, where a series of one-day strikes last year were quelled when concerns on transfers and promotions when settled.
Wilson said on Thursday that subsequent union claims for increases in total earnings of between 57% and 101% for some pilots were ""off the wall,"" particularly at a time when ""the world is falling apart aviation-wise.""
Asked if there had been any impact on bookings, Wilson said that while talk of strikes could worry some potential customers, the holiday season of August is the time of the year where the airline has its highest number of advance bookings.
He also confirmed reports from unions that Ryanair is likely to close its base in Faro and two in the Canary Islands as part of plans to cut is presence on the ground in airports due to delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX.
A final decision has yet to be made on how many bases, jobs and routes will be cut as a result, Wilson added."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's top food retailer X5 (L:PJPq) is gearing up to compete with burgeoning online players to meet growing demand for convenience foods from time- and price-conscious consumers, Chief Executive Officer Igor Shekhterman told Reuters.
""We used to compare ourselves with offline players, but we now say that we work in the food market and our competitors not only count traditional players, but also digital companies ... and fast-food restaurants,"" Shekhterman said.
E-commerce has flourished in Russia over the past decade, prompting brick-and-mortar retailers to invest in online services and delivery. In recent years, grocers have also felt the pinch from thriving online meals ordering companies.
""We see that this need is growing everywhere, it really is a trend: people want to cook less,"" Shekhterman said.
Even as Russians buy fewer and cheaper items due to falling disposable incomes, consumer's drive toward convenient food is only expected to rise, according to Shekhterman.
To meet this need, X5 opened this year its own ready-to-eat food production facility to cater to the Moscow region and plans to open a similar factory in St Petersburg in 2020-2021.
X5 also continues to expand the product range of its online shop perekrestok.ru and expects it to break even on the EBITDA level in 2021-2022, Shekhterman said.
Most of X5's over 15,000 stores are Pyaterochka low-cost neighborhood shops, and its second key format are more upscale Perekrestok supermarkets.
X5, which boosted sales 18% last year as it added 2,310 stores on a net basis, is on track to open a net 1,800 stores in 2019, Shekhterman said, adding that 2020 opening numbers were unlikely to be higher.
Competition from digital players has put pressure on food retailers' margins and Sherkhterman expects that the Russian market will gradually see EBITDA margins decline.
Unconventional players have also shown interest in online retail business. Sberbank (MM:SBER), Russia's top lender, said this week it had indirectly invested in Instamart, a company that delivers food from grocery shops.
X5 plans to raise capex for IT-projects next year, in order to automate assortment, price and promotions management.
""Clearly, digital players are coming, but we want to catch up with them first in terms of business processes,"" he said. The company currently spends around 10% of its capex on IT.
Sherkhterman hopes X5's ""digital transformation"" will result in savings that it can re-invest in keeping prices low."

DETROIT (Reuters) - UPS said on Thursday it has bought a minority stake in self-driving company TuSimple, and the world's largest package delivery company has been testing the startup's autonomous trucks since May on a busy freight route in Arizona.
The investment by UPS Ventures, the venture capital arm of  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), underscores bets that autonomous vehicle technology can expand more rapidly in commercial vehicles than in robotaxis.
It could take years to test and develop self-driving vehicles and for the government to build out a regulatory framework. But UPS sees the investment as a way to apply autonomous driving features like lane departure technology, advanced braking systems or sensor technology in its own fleet in the short term, said Todd Lewis, managing partner at UPS Ventures.
""From the regulatory perspective there is a long way to go,"" Lewis told Reuters. ""But the technology has a ton of implications today.""
UPS and TuSimple did not disclose the size of the investment. TuSimple's other investors include Chinese online media company  Sina Corp  (O:SINA) and U.S. chipmaker  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA).
In February TuSimple said it had raised $95 million in a funding round led by Sina, which valued the startup at $1 billion.
The company is also working with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) as the online retail giant builds out its own transportation ecosystem.
The TuSimple road tests for UPS' supply chain business run on a busy stretch of highway covering a little over 100 miles (160 km) between Phoenix and Tucson.
The trucks run around the clock, with the self-driving trucks delivering freight within UPS' system. TuSimple has a professional driver behind the wheel and an engineer in the passenger seat.
Silicon Valley firms to traditional carmakers are racing to put fully commercial self-driving vehicles on the road, while efforts by robotaxis companies such as General Motors Co (N:GM) unit Cruise and  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) have stumbled because it is very difficult and expensive to develop self-driving cars capable of anticipating and responding to humans in urban areas.
Experts says self-driving trucks are an easier proposition than robotaxis.
Self-driving trucks run consistently on predictable highway routes - in UPS' case carrying large numbers of revenue-generating packages or goods - around the clock, including in the early hours of the morning when driving conditions are ideal.
Robotaxis, however, pick up and drop off passengers at random locations, at random times, mostly during the day, leaving expensive assets largely unused overnight. That random business model also requires more extensive, costly mapping.
""The economics for a robotaxi are just not as strong as for a truck,"" TuSimple Chief Financial Officer Cheng Lu told Reuters. ""And a lot of investors see it that way as well.""
The startup also ran a two-week test for the U.S. Postal Service earlier this year transporting mail across three Southwestern states.
Chief Product Officer Chuck Price said TuSimple is currently evaluating the results of that test."

LONDON (Reuters) - China's threat to impose counter-measures in retaliation for the latest U.S. tariffs knocked stocks sprawling on Thursday, checking earlier attempt to recover from a rout sparked by fears of a world recession.
Wall Street futures erased earlier losses and were trading in positive territory, but the relentless drop in global bond yields raised fears the world economy was hurtling toward recession and weighed on global equities. 
Expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks would respond robustly to the recession warning helped world stocks to steady earlier. But that recovery was cut short by the latest rhetoric from Beijing
""The only game in town is the central banks, hence the bond markets are rallying,"" said Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
""We have regional bonfires in Hong Kong, Argentina, Japan against South Korea, and none of these are going away easily; each and every one is not necessarily strong enough to cause trouble.""
Recession fears grew on Wednesday after yields on 10-year Treasury bonds (US10YT=RR) dropped to less than two-year rates for the first time in 12 years, when the same yield curve inversion presaged the 2008 recession.
The curve has inverted before every recession in the past 50 years and sent a false signal just once [US/]. 
(GRAPHIC - U.S. yield curve inversion Aug. 14 2019 Image: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YQ1VhR)
The latest inversion has since reversed, albeit marginally, and yields on 30-year Treasuries (US30YT=RR) rose off the record 1.965% low reached in Asian trade. But they are still down 60 basis points in just 12 sessions.
Markets appear to be pinning their hopes, yet again, on central banks, betting that scale of the scare would alarm policymakers, especially at the Fed. Money markets price in a growing chance the Fed will cut rates by half a point at its September meeting. 
""We have seen stocks trading very poorly as a result of the yield curve inversion, so that will be flashing some additional warning lights for the Fed that they have to do more,"" said Andrea Iannelli, investment director at Fidelity International.
""The only question is, can the Fed out-dove the market? At the very least they will have to match market expectations in the short term."" 
The Chinese comments sent a pan-European equity index down more than half a percent (STOXX) and markets in London and Frankfurt lost over 1%. Earlier, Asian shares fell 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei shed 1.2% as a yen surge hit the export-heavy market (N225).
German 30-year yields are below minus 0.2% (DE30YT=RR) for the first time. Ten-year yields touched a record low of minus 0.67% (DE10YT=RR).
The growth worries come amid economic stress in Argentina and some other emerging markets, fears of Chinese military intervention in Hong Kong and trade tensions that show no sign of abating.
""Hoping for the best on the policy front but positioning for the worst on the economic backdrop seems to be the flavor of the day,"" said Stephen Innes, a managing partner at Valour Markets. ""The Fed, now out of necessity alone, will need to adjust policy much more profoundly than they expected.""
Not everyone buys the argument that recession is inevitable -- bond markets have been distorted by a decade of multi-trillion-dollar central bank stimulus. 
Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said how long the curve remained inverted, and to what extent, was crucial.
""If Fed rate cuts successfully steepen the curve comfortably into positive territory, this brief curve inversion may be a premature recession signal. Neither does a yield curve inversion indicate it is time to sell equities,"" Haefele said.
He noted that since 1975, every curve inversion had been followed by an S&P 500 rally that lasted almost two years and delivered average gains around 40%.
SAFETY PLAYS
As the Sino-U.S. trade war escalates, long-dated bond yields have fallen across the developed world, flattening yield curves in what is considered a clear signal of a worsening growth outlook.
What sent the U.S. curve over the brink into inversion was German data on Wednesday that showed the economy had contracted in the quarter to June. That came on the heels of dire Chinese data for July.
The British yield curve also inverted. The German curve is at its flattest since 2008.

153,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 07:55AM ET</span>","Alibaba results beat estimates on cloud, e-commerce growth","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit on Thursday, aided by growth in its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses.
The beats show the company is managing to outperform expectations even as it weathers an increasingly competitive e-commerce industry and a tougher macroeconomic environment.
Alibaba's revenue rose 42% to 114.92 billion yuan ($16.3 billion) in its first quarter ended June 30 from 80.92 billion yuan, a year earlier.
Analysts had expected revenue of 111.73 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
U.S.-listed shares in the company, which makes money primarily by selling advertising and promotional services to third-party merchants on its Taobao and Tmall sites, rose 3% to $166.72 in trading before the bell.
Two of the world's biggest e-commerce sites, Taobao and Tmall initially grew popular as internet adoption and mobile phone penetration soared in China.
Both Alibaba and smaller rival JD.com (O:JD) however are seeking to diversify amid slowing e-commerce revenue growth at home, due in part to markets in China's biggest cities becoming saturated.
JD also reported better-than-expected second-quarter revenue on Tuesday, boosted by stronger sales in its online retail business.
In response to a saturated user-base in wealthier parts of the country and growing competition from startup  Pinduoduo  (O:PDD), Alibaba is now targeting consumers in smaller cities. 
It has also tied up with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to deliver coffee.
Alibaba has been diversifying into cloud computing and digital entertainment as growth at its massive core e-commerce business slows, and has made major management changes.
Chief Executive Daniel Zhang is expected to formally take over founder Jack Ma's position as chairman in September, while the Chinese behemoth has put Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu in charge of its strategic investments unit. 
It has also expanded its brick-and-mortar Hema stores, to 150 by the end of the June quarter. In June, Alibaba said the stores would operate as a standalone business unit.
Revenues at its cloud computing business rose 66% to 7.79 billion yuan, while those at its core commerce business rose 44% to 99.54 billion yuan.
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was 21.25 billion yuan.
Excluding items, the company earned 12.55 yuan per American Depository Share. Analysts were expecting 10.25 yuan per ADS, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Alibaba is planning a secondary listing in Hong Kong according to sources, to replenish a war chest that has been diminished by investments to subdue threats from rivals such as food delivery firm Meituan.
Reuters reported in June that the company had confidentially filed for an IPO in the city that could raise up to $20 billion.
Alibaba has not yet commented on reports of such plans, but investors are watching keenly as increasingly violent demonstrations in Hong Kong take a toll on the city's image as Asia's biggest financial hub. 

The Hang Seng Index has dropped roughly 12% since late July, when protestors staged a sit-in at the Hong Kong International Airport.

LONDON (Reuters) - Negative interest rates, toppling bond yields, greater regulation and rising recession signals have wiped out most of the value of European banks, with their shares now at meltdown prices approaching the days of the Berlin Wall.
The index of the bloc's big banks (SX7E) plunged on Thursday to the level it hit in 2012 at the peak of the euro zone debt crisis.
That means the banks are worth now what they were when Greece, Ireland and Portugal needed bailouts, Cyprus ordered its banks to seize some deposits and Spain's banks were saved from collapse only by a government rescue.
Though it still hasn't quite matched the bottom of the 2008 financial crisis, the index has lost 84% of its value since its peak in 2007.
It is now a few points away from hitting levels seen in the 1980s, when the euro was barely a dream and some of the countries that now use it were still using Soviet roubles.
The wider banking sector for the bloc is now worth less than half a trillion dollars -- about half the size of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). It was down nearly 3% on Wednesday after Germany's economy shrank and the U.S. bond market showed red flags pointing to recession.
At their 2007 peak, euro-zone banks were worth $1.7 trillion, well above the value of their U.S. peers. Today, they are just one-third the size of banks on the other side of the pond.
1/ BANKS HAVE LOST OF 84% OF THEIR VALUE SINCE 2007
(GRAPHIC - Eurozone banks performance: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YNGnCp)
Rates are already in negative territory and markets are pricing in at least another 20 basis point cut by the European Central Bank (ECB), which would hit the banks' already low profitability.
Though the ECB has promised some mitigating measures such as deposit tiering -- lowering the charge that banks pay on some of their excess cash -- to dampen the impact of negative interest rates, it's still not clear how much it would help them.
""We do not expect it to be especially generous to the banking sector given the ECB's belief that negative rates are not yet hurting banks' profitability,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) lead banking analyst Jon Peace said.
2/ EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS TRACK BUND YIELDS
(GRAPHIC - Euro-zone bank earnings versus bund yields: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YLlmbD)
Europe's largest economy, Germany, is also at the brink of a recession and this is unnerving investors as this could mean that another banking crisis is looming.
The concerns this time are mainly centered around their profitability unlike last time when solvency was the issue, said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments.
""It's simply the consequence of a decade of extra regulation, unconventional monetary policy and deleveraging... There are not that many ways for banks to get out of this.""
On the other hand, U.S. banks have outperformed Europe by a huge margin on higher interest rates and stronger performance in investment banking and with elevated capital levels. They were also unscathed by the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.

3/ U.S. BANKS ARE NOW THREE TIMES BIGGER
Natixis believes the ""abnormally low capitalization"" of euro-zone banks would make them easy prey for U.S. banks.
The low level of return on equity also prevents the European banks from raising capital. Since they can't expand, they will have less capacity to fund business on the continent.
European companies looking for financing will increasingly have to raise it from markets or borrow it from U.S. or other foreign banks, Natixis analyst Patrick Artus said.

U.S. equity futures swung from gains to losses and back again on Thursday amid multiple headlines from China on the trade war. Treasuries and European bonds climbed.
Futures for the three main U.S. stock gauges had already reversed an earlier jump after Beijing pledged countermeasures to the next round of tariffs threatened by the White House.

156,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 07:42AM ET</span>",Alibaba’s Revenue Beat Highest Estimate As Online Sales Quicken,"(Bloomberg) --  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s quarterly revenue beat the highest analysts’ estimates after personalized shopping recommendations and a June sales bonanza drove China’s leading online retail business.
Revenue at Asia’s biggest company rose 42% to 114.9 billion yuan ($16.3 billion) in the three months ended June. That compares with the 111.6 billion yuan average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings per share came to 12.55 yuan versus the 10.3 yuan projected.
Alibaba, whose business is predominantly domestic, is riding a surge in internet shopping in defiance of a slowing home economy. Chinese online sales accelerated in the June quarter from the previous three months, helped by sales promotions that unfolded across the country’s largest e-commerce platforms. Alibaba is also fine-tuning services that target buyers based on personal preferences, introducing tweaks to product feeds for instance to boost ad revenue and buying.
“E-commerce growth remained strong in the second quarter,” David Dai, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Bernstein, said in a report before the earnings release. “We expect Alibaba user and transaction growth to accelerate in the second quarter.”
Alibaba is approaching a critical juncture just as Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang prepares to replace billionaire founder Jack Ma as chairman in September. A U.S. campaign of tariffs and other curbs is heightening uncertainty around the world’s second-largest economy, while the emergence of rivals at home such as Pinduoduo Inc. tests its longstanding dominance of Chinese online retail.
The e-commerce titan may be on the look-out for assets to bolster its lead. Alibaba is in talks to pay $2 billion for NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc.’s Kaola, which specializes in selling foreign goods to Chinese consumers, local media outlet Caixin reported.
The company is also hatching plans to raise more capital. Alibaba’s quarterly out-performance bolsters its ambition of pulling off what could be Hong Kong’s biggest share sale since 2010. The company is said to have already filed confidentially for a stock listing, but it’s unclear when it might go ahead with the float given the widespread protests that have gripped Hong Kong over the past 11 weeks."

We’re gonna need a smaller boat.
That’s one way to interpret the message from Maersk, the world’s largest shipping line, as it announced earnings Thursday with a subtle warning about the outlook for trade and possibly weaker demand growth for containers.
First came the good news: The Copenhagen-based company, which controls a fifth of the globe’s container fleet, said demand worldwide grew by about 2% in the second quarter from a year earlier — in line with its expected full-year growth of 1-3%. Profit beat analysts’ expectations. Chief Executive Officer Soren Skou said the company is managing the trade turmoil quite well so far. The stock jumped.
Then came the bad news, stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump’s import taxes on Chinese goods and Beijing’s retaliation. “The impact of the newly imposed tariff hike is expected to be significant for the U.S.-China bilateral trade and could in isolation remove up to 0.5% of global container demand in 2019 and 2020, and when U.S. tariffs on additional $300 billion is implemented later in the year, it could result in a reduction of up to 1% in 2020,” the company said.
A bite to demand of 0.5%-1% doesn’t sound that painful unless you consider that expectation for 2019 worldwide container growth is just 1%-3%.
All the unknowns about tariffs are hurting the shipping industry and the global economy more broadly, sending stocks and bond yields tumbling this week. Recession fears are rising in the U.S., Germany and the U.K., and trade hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong are on the edge of downturns. Meanwhile, the U.S. and China remain far apart on the substance of any deal. Beijing just announced plans to retaliate imminently against the 10% tariffs on about $110 billion of Chinese imports that Trump announced earlier this week. 
“There is a lot of uncertainty,” particularly about the U.S. and China, Maersk’s Skou told Bloomberg Television. “Right now there’s not much that suggests a deal will be done anytime soon. It seems to be going in the other direction.”
The bottom line from Maersk’s vantage point: We probably haven’t seen the worst of this storm yet.
Charting the Trade War
Twenty-four product categories — encompassing imports worth $1.9 billion — were dropped off Trump’s new China tariff lists published Tuesday. Newly exempted items include skinned haddock fillets, booster seats and radioactive elements.

158,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",U.S. Stock Futures Fall after China Threatens to Hit Back on Trade,"Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a sharply lower open on Wall Street on Thursday, erasing earlier gains as trade tensions escalated after Beijing vowed to take “countermeasures” over U.S. plans to slap new tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports.
China’s finance ministry said in a statement Thursday it has to take “necessary countermeasures” against U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods. The statement added that the tariffs violated a consensus reached by the leaders of both countries.
The escalation in the trade war came a day after a tweet by Trump that linked the dispute and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s handling of protests in Hong Kong.
Earlier this month Trump said the U.S. would impose tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods from Sept. 1, which would effectively cover all Chinese imports. He later said the new tariff would be deferred until Dec. 1 for around half of the goods affected.
Dow futures were down 187 points or 0.7% by 06:55 AM ET (10:55 GMT) while S&P 500 futures were down 16 points, or 0.6%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 79 points, or 1%.
The losses came after the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s worst day of the year on Wednesday, a day on which the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time in 12 years.
The inversion, where 2-year yields trade higher than 10-year yields, is considered by some analysts to be a sign that the U.S. economy is likely to enter a recession.
Investors were looking ahead to U.S. economic reports due out later in the day amid heightened concerns over the economic outlook.
Retail sales for July, the Empire State manufacturing index and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, as well as last week’s initial jobless claims and second-quarter unit labor costs all hit the wires at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Nationwide data for industrial and manufacturing output follow 45 minutes later, while the National Association of Home Builders’ Housing Market Index comes at 10 AM (1400 GMT).
Despite the gloomy news from China, there was better news closer to home as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) reported a stronger second quarter than expected and said its full-year profit would be at the top end of its previously announced range. The shares rose 5.8%, encouraged not least by a thumping 37% year-on-year rise in e-commerce sales.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Natalia Leontyeva, a Siberian sales manager, bought a second hand car in 2013 with a loan worth about four monthly salaries. She now owes the equivalent of at least four years of earnings, one of a growing number of Russians struggling with debt.
""You pay one month's instalment, then the second. But then something happens again and it all piles up,"" she said by phone from the city of Novosibirsk in Siberia where she works at a steelworks.
After five years of shrinking real incomes, many Russians are borrowing to make ends meet or even just to pay off their creditors - and the issue is climbing up the political agenda.
""A third of those people taking loans already owe more than their annual income,"" Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Oreshkin, Russia's economy minister, told Reuters. ""This is an issue of financial education, a debt trap, in some cases worse than gambling.""
For Russia as a whole, the burden of total household debt is relatively low, partly because only 5.5 million of its 147 million people have mortgages.
But interest rates on personal loans are high and more than half of Russians surveyed by state pollster VTsIOM said they had debts. For a significant number, they are a major concern.
Some 2.5 million people earning up to 20,000 roubles ($303.09) a month, which is less than half the average wage, spend more than half of that on loan repayments, the National Association of Professional Collection Agencies estimates.
On Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin discussed consumer debt with Andrey Kostin, head of second-biggest state-run bank VTB (MM:VTBR), telling him in televised comments, ""people should not be pushed to some kind of extreme state"".
Kostin told Putin he understood the problem and that banks should wear a ""human face"" when dealing with its clients.
Their exchange highlighted the sensitivity of the problem for Putin, whose popularity ratings have slipped since he was reelected by an overwhelming majority last year.
Moscow is in the grip of protests over the exclusion of opposition candidates from a local election and sporadic protests over issues ranging from waste disposal to unwanted construction have flared elsewhere.
TIGHTENING
The central bank has tightened lending rules in recent years, and raised the amount of money banks need to set aside to cover loan losses.
This has moderated the potential fallout for the financial system but Oreshkin said borrowers are still exposed.
""In consumer lending, there is high indebtedness and ... it is growing at a rate far higher than the nominal increases in incomes,"" he said.
Outstanding loans were 16.3 trillion roubles ($248 billion) as of early July, up from 10.6 trillion five years ago, according to central bank data.
And while the rate of consumer lending increase has dropped from a 60% year-on-year peak in 2012, it was still over 20% last year despite the central bank's attempts to rein it in.
Consumer lending growth rate has currently stabilized at 24-25% in annual terms, the central bank said in a response to a request to comment from Reuters.
""A fast increase in... outstanding consumer debt is leading to a rising debt burden for households,"" it said. ""This increases vulnerability of the financial system but the size of this lending segment does not pose... a threat, either for the banking sector's stability, or for the economy.""
Olga Ulyanova, an analyst with Moody's rating agency in Moscow, praised the central bank's measures but said more actions might be needed including a possible ban on lending to highly indebted borrowers.
""The central bank's measures are timely and preemptive,"" she said. ""But it will have to continue the policy of tightening as the current measures are not sufficient to normalize the segment's growth rate.""
The central bank said in its response that it will raise risk requirements again for consumer loans in October, under which banks will have to evaluate a borrower's existing debt before issuing a new loan.
Oreshkin has also said there was no risk for the financial system's stability as banks have enough provisions while adding, in comments to Russian media last month, that there was a bubble in consumer lending when it came to certain households.
The economy ministry is working on proposals to simplify the process of individuals declaring themselves bankrupt and on changing the criteria for people to claim insolvency based on income left over after loan repayments, he told Reuters.
""POINT OF NO RETURN""
Russia's household debt to gross domestic product ratio is 14%, compared with around 30% in Czech Republic and Poland and 75% in Sweden, Moody's said.
Non-performing loans, or outstanding debt by individuals that is not being serviced for more than 90 days, stood at 797 billion roubles, or 5% of the total retail loans held by banks, as of July 1, according to the central bank. These loans are provisioned by over 90%, it said.
But almost one in five new loans are being spent on servicing existing debt and more than 30% of consumer loans issued in January-March 2019 went to people already spending more than half their income on debt servicing, Moody's said, citing central bank data.
This means the lending is not fully filtering into growth in the economy, which is projected to grow at 1-1.5% this year versus 2.3% last year, under pressure from drop in oil prices and sanctions since 2014 over Russia's annexation of Crimea.
One high-ranking government financial official who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue said that when it came to those already spending large sums in debt servicing, ""the point of no return has been passed already"".
""The most dreadful thing is not that banks or the central bank do not realize there is an issue, but that people with salaries of 30-40,000 roubles have to spend 20,000 on servicing their debt,"" the official said.
The number of bankruptcies has grown from up to 20,000 in 2016, the year after a new private bankruptcy law came in, to almost 44,000 in 2018. It grew by around 29,000 in the first six months of this year, a 52% rise year-on-year, according to Russian official registry Fedresurs.
Consumer lending accounts for over a tenth of total loans at Russia's top banks, state-owned Sberbank (MM:SBER) and VTB (MM:VTBR), while for private TCS Group (L:TCSq) consumer lending forms its core business.
Mikhail Matovnikov, chief analyst with Sberbank, said that consumer lending growth is already slowing down and does not pose systemic risks.
VTB said that consumer loans are one of the most profitable businesses for the bank. But it said that VTB has a high quality consumer loan portfolio so there is no rise in non-performing loans in this area.
""Our bank has had risk processes for a long time already which do not allow loans to highly-indebted borrowers,"" VTB said in a written reply to Reuters. TCS did not reply to a request for a comment."

European stocks declined and U.S. equity futures pared a gain as China pledged to take countermeasures against planned American tariffs. Treasuries and most European bonds advanced.
The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell while the three main American equity contracts trimmed an earlier jump after China’s Ministry of Finance said the latest 10% tariffs on Chinese goods by the U.S. derail efforts to solve disputes via negotiations. Earlier equities climbed in Hong Kong and Shanghai, though they fell overall across Asia a day after the S&P 500 Index dropped as much as 3%. The onshore yuan steadies as China’s central bank added liquidity to the financial system. Gold reversed an earlier decline to edge up.
Investor caution remains high on risk assets, helping to drive the yield on 30-year Treasuries below 2% for the first time, while the world’s pile of negative-yielding debt surpassed $16 trillion. China’s promised response to new tariffs came just as markets seemed to be settling in the wake of Wednesday’s rout. Traders will now await any response from President Donald Trump, as well as data on U.S. retail sales and manufacturing.
“The bond market rally is as much a global story as a U.S. one, and yesterday it was weak data in Asia and Europe that dragged U.S. yields down,” Kit Juckes, a strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, wrote in a note. “But at some point, U.S. data need to justify the fall in U.S. yields, or at least a bigger part of them than recent data have.

Investing.com -- Fears of a global recession kept Europe’s stock markets under pressure again on Thursday, although pockets of strength in the ongoing second-quarter earnings season prevented a renewed rout.
By 5:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was down 0.4% at 364.72, while the German Dax was down 0.6% and the FTSE 100 was down 0.8% as sterling recovered on hopes that a No Deal Brexit may yet be avoided.
Trading was thinner than usual due to the Feast of the Assumption holiday in some markets.
Danish brewer Carlsberg (CSE:CARLa) helped drown some of the continent’s sorrows as a successful campaign of focusing on premium brands resulted in a 6.5% rise in half-year sales and a 1.6 percentage point improvement in operating margins. That was despite volume declines in its biggest single market, Russia. The shares rose 4.9% to a new all-time high and are now up 44% in 2019, one of the best-performing stocks in the region.
There was more good news out of Denmark with AP Moeller - Maersk (CSE:MAERSKa) rising 2.6% after a comparatively strong set of earnings. However, in contrast to Carlsberg (CSE:CARLa), the shares are merely correcting upwards after a drop of nearly 50% in the last two years. Trade wars generally aren’t kind to shipping companies, after all.
In the U.K., gambling company GVC, the owner of   Ladbrokes   (LON:LCL) and Corals, announced stronger-than-expected earnings and raised its dividend after absorbing the impact of tighter U.K. regulation. The company trimmed its forecast for shop closures in the U.K. by 10% after saying that customers had found other ways to gamble with them after lawmakers cracked down on the use of so-called Fixed-Odds Betting Terminals. 
As with Maersk, GVC has much ground to make up after losing half of its value (and its chief executive) in the last 13 months.

(Reuters) - China's Lenovo Group, the world's largest PC maker, warned it will have to raise product prices if U.S. tariffs increase, sending its shares tumbling 6.5% to two-month lows.
Lenovo's warning amid mounting business uncertainty due to the U.S.-China trade war cast doubt on its sales outlook and took the shine off forecast-beating quarterly results where robust PC sales helped the company more than double its profit.
U.S. President Donald Trump said this week that he would postpone imposing an additional 10% tariff on Chinese-made products including tablets and laptop computers until December, but would still impose the tariffs on desktops from September.
""Retail prices for products like PC and smartphones will increase if (U.S.) tariffs increase,"" Lenovo Chairman Yang Yuanqing told an earnings call on Thursday.
He also said shifting manufacturing from China to avoid U.S. tariffs would also lead to product price increases, although Lenovo's global production footprint gives it flexibility in making adjustments, and it remains committed to China.
The global PC market grew 1.5% in the June quarter after falling for two consecutive quarters, as threats of increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods prompted some manufacturers to frontload shipments, industry analysts said.
Lenovo emerged as the biggest winner of the global PC market's surprise rebound in the second quarter. Citing industry data, the company said it had a record 25.1% market share in the quarter.
Lenovo said it was the fastest growing PC maker among the top five manufacturers and its improved product mix also helped the business' pre-tax profit margin rise to 5.4%, the highest margin ever attained in a fiscal first quarter.
Revenue from Lenovo's personal computer and smart devices group grew 12%, while its mobile business group recorded a 9% fall in sales. 
Its PC and smart devices business generates more than three quarters of the group's total revenue, which rose 5%.

Net profit rose to $162 million in the quarter ended June, compared with an average estimate of $154 million by nine analysts, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue rose to $12.51 billion, in line with expectations.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 04:31AM ET</span>",More major banks bet on steeper Australian rate cuts as trade risks rise,"By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank, HSBC and Citi are betting that Australia's central bank will cut interest rates more steeply than previously thought as global trade tensions ratchet up and domestic hiring intentions slow.
Economists at CBA (AX:CBA), Australia's biggest bank by market capitalization, said in a note on Thursday they expect one 25 basis point (bps) easing in November followed by a second in February, taking the key rate to 0.5%. Earlier, they had predicted just one cut to 0.75%.
HSBC and Citi followed up with a similar predictions of two cuts.
HSBC had expected the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to halt its current easing cycle after two back-to-back reductions in June and July to a record low of 1%. Citi had earlier forecast another easing to 0.75%.
With the RBA pledging to do more if needed, the revised expectations from these banks now match financial market pricing .
""There has been further escalation in the trade and technology tensions between the U.S. and China, which is now having a more distinct impact on currency markets too,"" HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham said in a note.
""We expect the local labor market and global downside risks to motivate the RBA to cut further,"" Bloxham added.
The clear and present danger to the economy prompted RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle to warn of the growing risks from the trade war. In a speech on Thursday, Debelle said a slowdown in business investment decision risked a self-fulfilling global downturn.
HSBC's change in view was led by an abrupt escalation in the trade war this month when U.S. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports. That led to a sharp depreciation in the yuan, prompting Washington to label China a ""currency manipulator.""
The rising tensions have heightened fears that a significant economic slowdown in China would severely hurt Australia's growth as the two economies are closely intertwined.
Further raising concerns about domestic momentum, official data on Thursday showed Australia's jobless rate was stuck at a disappointingly high 5.2% in July even as employment surged past expectations.
""The leading indicators of the labor market are pointing to reasonable jobs growth. But they are running at a level that suggests progress in reducing labor market slack will stall,"" CBA's economics team wrote.
Australia's economy has dodged a recession since the early 1990s thanks to insatiable appetite from China for its key commodities but growth has now slowed to the weakest since the global financial crisis.
The protracted Sino-U.S. trade war has fueled fears of a global recession, hammering financial markets overnight and pulling yields on 10-year Treasuries below those on two-year paper. That inversion of the curve has been a reliable predictor of recessions in the past.
Financial markets are pricing in policy easing by all major central banks.
""The global backdrop looks more risky,"" Citi economist Josh Williamson said.
""The domestic economy requires more policy accommodation."""

170,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 02:44AM ET</span>",Boeing delays delivery of ultra-long-range version of 777X,"By Eric M. Johnson and Jamie Freed
SAN FRANCISCO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has pushed back the entry into service of an ultra-long-range version of its forthcoming 777X widebody, the U.S. planemaker said on Wednesday, as it grapples with fallout from the 737 MAX crisis and engine issues with the 777X.
The fresh delay comes as the grounding of Boeing's money-spinning 737 MAX single-aisle entered a sixth month in August, and as the world's largest planemaker faces engine-related delays on the 777X widebody that have pushed the first flight of the 777-9 into 2020. 
The delay in the slower-selling, longer-range 777-8 will hamper Boeing's ability to provide a plane in line with the schedule for Qantas Airways Ltd's plan for 21-hour non-stop Sydney-London flights. 
The Australian airline had hoped for first deliveries of the planes in 2022 and the launch of the world's longest commercial flight in 2023.
""We reviewed our development program schedule and the needs of our current 777X customers and decided to adjust the schedule,"" Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said by e-mail, adding that the manufacturer remained committed to the 777-8. 
""The adjustment reduces risk in our development program, ensuring a more seamless transition to the 777-8. We continue to engage with our current and potential customers on how we can meet their fleet needs. This includes our valued customer Qantas."" 
The Air Current website first reported the delays, saying the 350-seat 777-8 model revised for ultra-long-range flights had originally been scheduled to enter service in 2022 after the arrival of the 777-9 in 2020.
The decision effectively means Boeing engineers have frozen development work on the ultra-long-range version of the 777X. The schedule delay could jeopardize competition with European arch-rival Airbus SE for a slice of the ultra-long-haul travel market.
Airbus, which is offering an ultra-long-range version of its A350-1000, and Boeing have already submitted their ""best and final"" offers to Qantas for planes capable of the 17,000 km (10,560 mile) Sydney-London route, a Qantas spokesman said.
""We still expect to make a decision by the end of this calendar year,"" he said.
Boeing's proposal included a ""compelling option"" to help deal with the 777-8 delay because it was keen to the stay in the race, according to a source with knowledge of the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. 
An Airbus spokesman said details of its discussions with Qantas remained confidential but the A350 was a ""perfect solution"" to meet the airline's needs.
To date, Emirates and Qatar Airways are Boeing's only customers for the 777-8, having ordered 35 and 10 respectively. The Seattle Times in June reported Emirates was renegotiating its 777X orders.

Emirates and Qatar Airways did not respond immediately to requests for comment about the 777-8 delays.

The brewer posted improved earnings but saw declining sales in Russia, its key market, due to tough competition and price hikes at the beginning of the year leading to a loss of market share.
Total volume in Russia declined by 3%, the company said. 
Asia, the brewer's fastest-growing market, delivered organic net revenue growth of 15%, lifted by 8.5% volume growth and increased sales of premium brands, even though the Chinese market declined slightly, the company said.
""Asia continues strongly as expected. It looks good over there both on volume and price mix and their craft and specialty beer"", Jyske Markets analyst Henrik Hallengreen Laustsen told Reuters. 
Carlsberg has shifted its focus from cost-cutting to revenue growth, especially by selling more of its pricier brands. 
The brewer reported a 3% increase in price/mix, which indicates whether the company sold more of its expensive brews. 
Sales in the first six months of the year came in at 32.99 billion Danish crowns ($4.9 billion), the company said. 
""We delivered a strong set of results for the first six months of 2019, with healthy top-line development, strong margin improvement and continued solid cash flow"" Chief Executive Officer Cees 't Hart said.
Operating margins came in at 16%, an improvement of 160 basis points, the company said.

Net profit for the period jumped to $162 million, compared with the expected $154 million. Revenue was recorded at $12.51 billion, in line with expectation.
Despite the positive numbers, Lenovo warned that the company's outlook is uncertain due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China.
""There is a complexity of macro risks arising from ongoing trade negotiations, import tariff changes implemented by countries and challenges alongside geopolitical uncertainties,"" according to the company statement.

173,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 01:13AM ET</span>",Bond Rally Charges On With 30-Year Treasury Yields Below 2%,"(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
Alarm bells are ringing louder in bond markets.
Among the superlatives: the yield on 30-year Treasuries fell below 2% for the first time and the world’s pile of negative-yielding debt surpassed $16 trillion. And looming over it all was the 10-year Treasury yield dipping below the two-year, in what’s considered a harbinger of a U.S. economic recession in the next 18 months.
That expectation, nurtured in recent weeks by worsening U.S.-China trade relations and signs global growth is slowing, was bolstered by weak Chinese and German economic data. The so-called yield inversion drew the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump, who tweeted that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is “clueless.”
“We’re heading into a global recession and central banks don’t have much ammunition to counter it,” said Nader Naeimi, AMP Capital Investors Ltd.’s head of dynamic markets in Sydney. “The huge shock from the trade war has basically offset whatever central banks are doing, and that’s some of the signals from the yield-curve inversion.”
The 30-year Treasury yield fell as much as three basis points to 1.9883% in Asia trading on Thursday, after sliding 15 basis point the day before.
Meanwhile, an inversion of the 2-10 year yield curve that briefly occurred during New York trading surfaced again. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped as much as 2 basis points to 1.5573%, below the 2-year’s rate of 1.5609%.
Bad European and Chinese data were the trigger for the global bond rally, said Praveen Korapaty, chief global rates strategist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). “From the pace of the move, I suspect some long-held steepeners are being unwound as well.”
Another widely-watched recession indicator, the yield difference between three-month and 10-year Treasuries, inverted in March and has been negative much of the time since, bedeviling investors who anticipated that the curve would steepen as the Fed began to cut interest rates. The global rush for bonds also inverted the two-year to 10-year U.K. yield curve Wednesday.
Trump placed the blame for the “crazy inverted yield curve” squarely on the U.S. central bank, which he believes raised interest rates too quickly. The Fed’s reluctance to ease policy more aggressively is “holding us back,” he tweeted.
Yield curves normally slope upward as investors demand compensation for putting money at risk over longer periods.
As fears grow of a weaker economy in the future, investors drive down yields on longer-dated assets on expectation that rates will drop. There’s another incentive to buy longer bonds, and that’s due to the positive convexity value. This means that those with a longer duration will see larger price climbs in a rally than those with shorter maturities.
The U.S. bond market has been a destination for haven flows given that there are fewer and fewer positive-yielding assets to park cash in globally, according to Richard Kelly, head of global strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank.
“The curve inversion to this point is flagging a 55-to-60 percent chance of a U.S. recession over the next 12 months,” Kelly said. “We can all debate whether those signals are as accurate as they once were, but we still seem to be in a slow grind lower for sentiment and momentum and need some positive surprises to change those trends.”
The curve isn’t the only thing flashing high alert. The New York’s Fed index showing the probability of a recession over the next 12 months is close to its highest level since the global financial crisis, at around 31%.
Others aren’t ready to sound the alarm yet. Former Fed chair Janet Yellen said Wednesday that the economy has enough strength to avoid a recession, but noted that the odds have “clearly risen.” She also said that the yield curve has become a “less good signal” of a downturn.
There’s little evidence in U.S. economic data to suggest a recession is imminent, according to Goldman’s Korapaty, who sees the 10-year yield returning to 1.75% by year-end. Independent strategist Marty Mitchell said the yield curve’s brief inversion is unlikely to materially sway traders’ behavior.
“Investors, portfolio managers, asset managers, hedge funds, and quants aren’t likely to change their market and economic thesis simply because the 2yr/10yr spread moves from +1bp to -1bp,” wrote Mitchell in a report Wednesday. “Yes, a more severe and prolonged inversion will cause them to make adjustments, but that’s not where we are today.”
Others including macro hedge fund Ensemble Capital are more wary of rising recession risks.
“Yes, recession is coming,” according to Ensemble’s Chief Investment Officer Damien Loh. “The ball’s in the court of the White House and Trump given the flip flops on trades we’ve seen.”

174,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 01:12AM ET</span>",German Profit Warnings Signal Trade Woes May Bring On Recession,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany Inc.’s outlook for the rest of the year is filled with gloom, suggesting a recession could be in the cards.
Companies from Europe’s largest economy lead the list of profit warnings issued in the region during the latest earnings season. Daimler, BASF, Continental, Henkel, Lufthansa and Metro are among those that have cut their outlook. Many more have drawn bleak pictures of their prospects.
The combined misery of corporate Germany was highlighted on Wednesday, when a report showed a quarterly contraction of the economy, the second in the past year. Surveys for the third quarter have hinted at a further deterioration, with a manufacturing gauge firmly pointing to shrinking output.
At the heart of companies’ concerns are weaker global growth, dwindling demand from China, and trade tariffs -- factors that hurt Germany’s export-heavy industrial sector in particular.
Industrial companies have fared worst during the second-quarter earnings season. Expectations for German businesses were comparatively low, but even so, only 41% of them managed to beat sales estimates. The ratio is well above 50% in France, Italy and Spain.
The consequences are starting to be felt. Unemployment rose by a total of 62,000 in the three months through July and demand for new workers continued to soften.
That’s bad news for a country hoping to make up dwindling exports with consumption and investment. Domestic demand still supported the economy in the second quarter but that might change once uncertain prospects prompt companies and households to rein in spending.
Economists at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and ABN Amro Bank see Germany’s economy contracting again in the third quarter, pushing the nation in recession -- it’s first in six and a half years. Many more analysts say the risk of such a scenario has increased significantly after Wednesday’s report.
European banks are already preparing for an economic slump. Loan-loss provisions have risen for a second quarter, after declining during all of 2016 and 2017.
Shares in Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), which has revamped its business model to focus on lending to corporate and individual clients in Germany, have slumped to a record low.
“Earnings are shrinking and entire sectors are in deep crisis,” said Andreas Lipkow, a strategist at Comdirect Bank. “The current effects of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China have noticeably arrived at German export companies.”"

The MSCI All-Country World Index closed below its 200-day moving average on Wednesday for the first time since early June. It was joined by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A break below the support level is seen by some traders as a bearish signal for stocks.
“For the Dow itself, this violation of its 200-day average comes barely a month after it was trading at a new high,” said Sundial Capital Research Inc. founder Jason Goepfert in a note. “That’s a quick turnaround for the venerable index, and of course raises the prospects that the latest push to its highs was a false breakout, with the 200-day violation indicating likely weakness ahead.”
The Dow’s drop means that two of the so-called Big Four U.S. benchmarks are now below their key averages, with the Russell 2000 Index of small stocks having done so earlier this month. While the S&P 500 Index is about 6% off its record high from July, it remains above its 200-day support around the 2,796 level.
“The S&P is not broken, but clearly it’s not ‘strong’ either having swung more than 1% intraday in each of the past 8 sessions,” Evercore ISI technical analyst Rich Ross wrote Wednesday. “I thought this period of outsized volatility would resolve itself higher, but my confidence in that view has waned as we test support at 2,850.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai on Wednesday circulated a draft order that would grant approval to the $26 billion tie-up of T-Mobile Us Inc and Sprint Corp.
""The evidence conclusively demonstrates that this transaction will bring fast 5G wireless service to many more Americans and help close the digital divide in rural areas,"" Pai said in a statement.
The order must still be approved by two of the other four FCC commissioners. The U.S. Justice Department approved the merger last month, but the deal still faces a court challenge from 16 state attorneys general. A trial is set for Dec. 9 on the legal challenge by the states.
The lengthy draft FCC order has not been made public.
In May, Pai came out in favor of the deal after the companies offered concessions, including selling Sprint’s Boost Mobile prepaid cellphone service, as did FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican. The panel’s third Republican, Mike O’Rielly, said in May he was ""inclined to support"" the proposed merger.
On Wednesday, Democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel wrote on Twitter she was ""not convinced that removing a competitor will lead to better outcomes for consumers"" and said the public should be able to comment before the commissioners vote.
The third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless companies have agreed to divest Sprint’s prepaid businesses to satellite television company Dish Network Corp to create a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Critics, including some state attorneys general, say competition will not increase and prices for mobile phone plans will rise.
T-Mobile USA Chief Executive John Legere wrote on Twitter the order was ""another milestone toward bringing #NewTMobile and #5GForAll to life for US consumers!""
Advocacy group Free Press research director S. Derek Turner questioned Pai's decision to back the merger before a formal order had been drafted.
""Given the harmful impacts of this merger and the shady manner in which the FCC’s approval was reached behind closed doors, the public should have the opportunity to weigh in and comment before the full agency vote is final,"" Turner said in a statement.
Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim praised Pai's announcement. ""We are now one step closer to strengthening competition for high-quality 5G networks that will benefit American consumers nationwide,"" he said in a statement."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors in the upcoming initial public offering of WeWork's parent, The We Company, are being asked to lower their standards for corporate governance beyond what other technology startups have demanded, securities law experts said on Wednesday.
Adam Neumann, the company's CEO and co-founder, will control the company through his ownership of shares with high voting power, a common structure among newly listed Silicon Valley unicorns, including ride-sharing startup  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), Snapchat owner  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) and social media giant  Facebook Inc  (O:FB).
The We Company will take a financial hit for this decision, as the S&P 500 and some other major indices exclude companies with dual-class shares. On the other hand, many investors have overcome their concerns about founders retaining a tight grip on fast-growing startups, because of fear of missing out on potentially lucrative returns.
But We Company, whose losses are widening with no stated path to profitability, has awarded Neumann unusual privileges that go beyond what most stock market investors are accustomed to, corporate governance experts said.
These include giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donates to charitable causes, according to We Company's IPO filing made public on Wednesday.
""WeWork is pushing the outer bounds of what's acceptable for a public company,"" said Glenn Davis, research director at the Council of Institutional Investors, an investor advocacy group. ""The IPO filing indicates that the objective is to preserve incumbent control indefinitely.""
We Company co-founder Rebekah Neumann, Adam Neumann's wife who is the company's chief brand and impact officer, will pick his successor if he dies or is permanently disabled in the 10 years following the IPO, alongside two company board members. She will get to pick those board members if two people currently on the board, Bruce Dunlevie and Steven Langman, step down.
The set-up is odd, according to Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware.
""You want someone independent to be in charge of succession planning,"" Elson said. ""Given the fact it's a dual-class company, though, it doesn't really matter because no matter what happens, he and his family remain in control.""
The couple is also incentivized to donate $1 billion to charities over the next decade to keep their control of the company at current levels. Neumann will retain his high vote shares if he hits the target, if not, the number of votes per share will decrease, according to the IPO filing. While he would still likely control the company, his grip could loosen if the voting power of his shares becomes diluted.
""Could they give money to their own organization? These are the types of specifics shareholders would like to look at,"" said Anne Sheehan, who is the chair of the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's investor advisory committee, which makes recommendations for the agency to consider but does not represent its views.
""The conflict could be huge and they benefit on both sides.""
A spokesman for We Company, which rents out workspace to clients under short-term agreements, declined to comment beyond its IPO filing.
SELF-DEALING
Neumann has entered into several transactions with the We Company over the years, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent. He has also secured a $500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.
The We Company also revealed on Wednesday it plans to go public with an all-male seven-member board of directors, a practice major investors such as BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) frown upon. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, encourages companies to have at least two women directors on their board, according to its guidelines for corporate ballots released this year.
""Given the fact that this is the first time in history that boards of directors of S&P 500 companies have at least one woman on the board, it would be very unusual for a company to go public today without having diversity of gender on the board,"" said Steve Balet of corporate governance advisory firm Strategic Governance Advisors."

Pivotal shares jumped 63% to $13.60, while shares of VMWare were down about 3% at $148.25 in extended trading. Dell is the controlling stockholder for both the companies. Dell's shares dropped 1.65% to $47.80 in after-market trading on Wednesday.
Special board committees at both companies are negotiating an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Class A stock of Pivotal for cash at $15 a share, according to a regulatory filing.
The offer price represents an 81% premium to Pivotal's Wednesday close. Shares of Pivotal, which provides tools for software developers working with cloud services from different companies, have fallen 49% this year.
VMWare provides cloud computing and virtualization software and services.
Pivotal confirmed that it was in discussion with VMWare but said a definitive agreement between the companies has not been executed.
The VMware Special Committee has requested that Dell exchange Pivotal Class B stock for VMWare Class A stock.
Dell and the VMware special committee are discussing a to-be-agreed upon exchange ratio, the regulatory filing showed.
Michael Dell and Dell owned 131.3 million shares of Pivotal Class B stock, not including the 44.2 million shares of Pivotal Class B stock held by VMware, according to the filing."

(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) said on Wednesday that impending U.S. tariffs and Chinese customers shunning the networking company's gear were weighing on its business, and it forecast sales and profit below Wall Street targets.
Cisco executives said sales in China fell 25% and that the country's state-owned enterprises were no longer taking bids from Cisco.
""We're not being allowed to even participate anymore,"" Cisco Chief Executive Chuck Robbins told investors on a conference call.
Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said in an interview that Chinese companies were dropping Cisco gear and instead buying hardware from domestic Chinese companies.
""There's a certain sense of nationalism,"" Kramer said.
Cisco estimated first-quarter revenue growth of 0% to 2%. This implies a range of $13.07 billion to $13.33 billion, while analysts expect $13.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
It estimated adjusted earnings of 80 cents to 82 cents per share in the first quarter of 2020, below analysts' forecast of 83 cents.
Shares of Cisco, a Dow component, fell 3.4% in the runup to results amid broader declines in the market, and dropped 8% to $46.53 in after-hours trading.
While sales to China fell sharply, they comprised less than 3% of overall sales in Cisco's fiscal fourth quarter. Slower orders from large businesses, especially in the United Kingdom, also contributed to the below-expectations forecast.
Cisco said U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods would soon hit its products, dragging down margins in its fiscal first quarter. U.S. President Donald Trump said this week he would delay a 10% tariff on some Chinese-made goods until December. But Kramer said most of Cisco's goods were not part of the temporary reprieve and face tariffs next month.
""Nothing got excluded so far,"" Kramer said.
That would weigh on the company's margins in its fiscal first quarter, she added. Cisco forecast adjusted gross margins of 63% to 64%, virtually unchanged from the 62.9% in the just-reported quarter.
Since taking the helm in July 2015, CEO Robbins has emphasized growth areas such as the cloud, Internet of Things and cybersecurity through acquisitions.
Sales in Cisco's cybersecurity business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, rose 14% to $714 million in the fourth quarter, but missed estimates of $737.1 million.
Net income fell to $2.21 billion, or 51 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended July 27. Excluding items, it earned 83 cents, above estimates of 82 cents.
Total revenue rose 4.5% to $13.43 billion and beat the average analyst estimate of $13.39 billion."

A total of 26 firms with debts totaling $10.96 billion have filed for court restructuring through mid-August, according to the law firm's report.
Last year, 28 companies filed for bankruptcy, listing $13.2 billion in debt, while 24 firms sought protection in 2017 with $8.5 billion in debt.
""So far this year there has been an uptick in the number of filings,"" Haynes & Boone said, noting 20 of the filings have been since May.
Through most of 2019, U.S. light, sweet crude oil (CLc1) has been stuck in the $50-range on the New York Mercantile Exchange, finishing on Wednesday at $55.23. West Texas Intermediate averaged $65.06 a barrel last year. Natural gas prices also have fallen so low in some places that some companies have shut in wells and others have paid pipeline operators to take their gas.
Buddy Clark, a Haynes & Boone partner, said however that he did not predict a new wave of producer bankruptcies similar to that which followed the oil price collapse mid-decade. In 2015, there were 44 oil and gas producers filing for protection with combined debts of $17.4 billion.
""We're not going to see anywhere near the wave of bankruptcies in 2015,"" Clark said in an interview.
Many of 2019's filings are pre-planned, Chapter 11 restructurings, where creditors agree in advance on a financial restructuring plan, Clark said.
""I don't think you will see a lot of Chapter 7 (liquidations),"" he said. ""When you see Chapter 7s is when there are no assets left. Typically, there are always assets left.""
In the oilfield services industry, there were 10 bankruptcy filings so far this year, with Weatherford International Plc by far the largest. It filed in July, listing unsecured debts of $7.4 billion, according to the report. The remaining nine firms combined have debts with a total value of $205 million.
The bright spot in the industry was the midstream sector. Only one pipeline company,  Southcross Energy Partners LP  (PK:SXEEQ), filed for bankruptcy so far this year. It listed debts totaling $828 million."
182,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 06:32PM ET</span>",Ackman bets on idol Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire U.S. investor William Ackman has long described how Warren Buffett, often called the greatest stock picker ever, has influenced his career. Now he's paying the Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha the ultimate homage with a new investment in Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  (N:BRKa) (N:BRKb).
Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management bought 3.5 million Berkshire Hathaway B shares during the second quarter, the fund manager said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. At Wednesday's close, the investment would be worth roughly $686 million.
It marks the first time that Ackman's $8 billion fund has announced a new position since late last year when it bought a stake in  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX).
The new stake in the company with a $510 billion market capitalization will be a passive investment for Ackman's firm, a person familiar with his thinking said.
Pershing Square made its reputation as an activist investment firm by pushing for changes at companies ranging from railway Canadian Pacific (TO:CP) to restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG).
But Ackman is unlikely to offer suggestions or work behind the scenes to persuade the 88-year old Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's founder and leader, to change direction.
Indeed, Ackman has publicly credited Buffett with guiding his career. The 53-year old said he has studiously taken pointers from Buffett's investor letters, including the ones he wrote before creating Berkshire Hathaway. Four years ago, Forbes featured Ackman on the cover of its magazine, calling him 'Baby Buffett.'
At first blush, the investment might seem odd, as Berkshire Hathaway ranks among the world's best known stocks - one that parents often bestow as graduation gifts, designed to hold onto for a lifetime. Two Pershing investors Reuters spoke to grumbled that they would pay hedge fund-like fees for a name everyone knows.
But other investors and analysts called it a smart move and described it as a place for Ackman to put cash while searching for another activist position.
Currently Berkshire stock is considered to be less expensive than it has been for some time, having fallen 9% in the last three months.
One reason might be the Kraft-Heinz merger which Berkshire and private equity company 3G Capital engineered in 2015 and which Buffett said earlier this year that he overpaid for.
NEXT TARGET
Speculation has mounted for a week about what Ackman's next position might be after he told investors that he had exited Automatic Data Processing (ADP) (O:ADP) and United Technologies (N:UTX) and had a new position on.
Pershing Square has gained roughly 50% during the first seven months of this year, making it one of the world's best performing investment firms.
The gains illustrate how Ackman's efforts to rebuild his performance record after a few rocky years are bearing fruit, with bets on Starbucks and Chipotle proving to be big winners.
Recent changes in the portfolio also suggest that Ackman is not likely to hold onto an investment where he sees potential problems or where there is not much money to be made ahead.
He bought United Technologies in the first quarter of 2018 and exited after the company announced a planned merger with Raytheon (N:RTN) that he told management he did not like.
He owned ADP from the middle of 2017 and worked behind the scenes with management after having lost a proxy contest two years ago. He earned $1.25 billion on the ADP investment but told investors last week that he cashed out because gains might not be as steep in the months ahead."
183,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 06:18PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Retail Sales, Jobless Claims, Philly Fed, Industrial Output Due
With a host of retailers reporting earnings this week, retail sales for July will likely come under added scrutiny as investors look for signs that consumer spending, the backbone of the U.S. economy, remains robust.
The Commerce Department will release the numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that retail sales slowed to 0.3% last month and that core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, remained unchanged at 0.4%. The retail sales control group, which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP, is expected to slow to 0.5% from last month's 0.7% print.
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Aug. 11. Economists forecast that initial jobless claims rose to 214,000 from 209,000 previously.
At 8:30 a.m. ET, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank will release its measure of manufacturing activity in the region. The Philly Fed index is expected to fall to a reading of 10 from 21.8 last month, as manufacturing activity has been dented by the U.S.-China trade war.
New York manufacturing activity, meanwhile, is expected to fall to a reading of 3 from 4.3 last month.
An update on U.S. industrial production activity for July, due at 9:30 AM ET, is expected to show a slight uptick to 0.1% from 0% the previous month.
2. Banks on Notice as Yield Curve Sinks
The bond markets are likely to be closely watched again Thursday in what has become a running theme this week after the 10-year/2-year Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time since 2007.
The 10-Year Treasury yield briefly slipped below the 2-year on Wednesday, but remains a few basis points wide of inverting again, underpinning fears of a looming recession. 
Bank of Montreal highlighted -7.6 basis points as the next support level for the spread, the intraday low from May 2007, followed by -16.5 basis points and then -20.1 basis points.
Further declines in rates will likely trigger yet more pressure on banks that are vulnerable to a fall in net interest income, the difference between interest paid and interest received.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) fell more than 4% today, pushing the Financial Select Sector exchange-traded fund (NYSE:XLF) down more than 3.7%.
3. Nvidia, Walmart,  Alibaba  Report for Earnings Duty
The earnings season may be drawing to a close, but earnings from lNVIDIA, Walmart and Alibaba will be watched for clues about the underlying environment in their respective markets.
|
NVIDIA
Walmart is set to deliver fiscal-second-quarter earnings before the opening bell. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is expected to report earnings of $1.22 per share on revenue of $130.18 billion, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com.
Walmart’s quarterly report will also be parsed for an update on its efforts to offset increased costs from tariffs imposed on Chinese exports. The retailing giant, in the previous quarter, said it would raise prices to offset these costs.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) also reports earnings before the bell Thursday, with many keen to see if the company’s cloud-computing and business-to-business segments can offset some weakness amid the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.
RBC Capital expects Alibaba's cloud business to generate a 76% increase in top-line growth in the quarter.
Alibaba is expected to report earnings of $10.29 per share on $111.78 billion in revenue.
Ahead of NVIDIA's fiscal-second-quarter earnings – due after the market close – analysts have delivered a mixed outlook on the company's two main segments.
“Fiscal second-quarter gaming revenues, as well as NVDA's fiscal third-quarter forecast, are likely to meet or exceed estimates in our view in light of modest expectations,” Wedbush said in a note to clients. But data center revenues are more of a question mark, the brokerage added.
NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to report earnings of $1.14 a share on revenue of $2.55 billion."
184,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 05:47PM ET</span>",Stocks - Major Wall Street Indexes Sink 3% as Yield Curve Sounds Recession Alarm,"Investing.com - Stocks plunged Wednesday after a key economic signal warned that the slowing global economy may produce a recession and both Germany and China showed more signs of slowing growth.
At the close, the S&P 500 fell 2.93%. The Nasdaq Composite and Dow were both down a little more than 3%. The Dow fell more than 800 points, its biggest one-day loss of the year and worst since Oct. 18, 2018, when the index fell nearly 832 points.
The emotional catalyst came early in the day when the yield on the 10-Year Treasury note briefly fell below that of the 2-Year Treasury for the first time since 2007. When the yield curve inverts, paying higher yields for shorter-term securities, it indicates that investors are not only moving out of stocks and into safer bonds, but that they are worried about short-term prospects and piling into longer-term debt.
The 10-year yield closed at 1.595%, while the 2-year yield was at 1.589%. 
The market slump has seen the Dow fall 7% from its record high in July. The S&P is off 6.2% from its July peak and the Nasdaq is down 6.8%.
The market stress comes amid the backdrop of the continuing trade fight between the United States and China. The Trump Administration has imposed tariffs on a wide variety of goods and is set to impose more on Sept. 1. Another round is due on Dec. 15, which would include cell phones and other electronics and consumer goods. The tariffs have hit Chinese exports and forced a number of companies to search out new manufacturing sites outside China, mostly in Southeast Asia.
Meanwhile, China has retaliated against the U.S. with their own tariffs. In addition, China has shied away from buying some U.S. products, especially soybeans.
At the same time, slumping exports sent Germany's economy into reverse in the second quarter, while Chinese industrial output growth cooled to a more-than-17-year low in July.
Interest rates globally have fallen as the scope of the slowdown has emerged. The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate on July 31 to 2% to 2.25% even as President Donald Trump bitterly bashed the central bank and called for much lower rates. His criticism continued Wednesday. The Fed is expected to cut rates again at its meeting in mid-September and in October, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
None of the Dow stocks were higher, although Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), both classic defensive stocks, were off about 1%. Boeing (NYSE:BA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) were the biggest contributors to the Dow's decline.
Boeing's 3.7% decline was worth 84 Dow points. Goldman Sachs, off 4.2%, subtracted 57 points from the index.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were all off at least 3%. 
Cisco fell an additional 6% after hours after the guidance in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report disappointed Wall Street.
Only one stock in the Nasdaq 100 Index was higher on the day, Chinese internet company NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) rose 0.5%. The index fell 3.1%.
The day was so bad that just three S&P 500 stocks showed gains on the day: Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM), Ventas (NYSE:VTR), a real-estate investment trust, and Midwestern utility company Evergy (NYSE:EVRG).
The day was so bad that just three S&P 500 stocks showed gains on the day
Energy, communications services (which includes Facebook and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and financial stocks were the weakest sectors, along with retailers, including Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), both down more than 10%. 
Real estate and utilities were only slightly lower because of falling interest rates.
Stocks globally were lower, with stocks in Germany and France off more than 2% and Brazil's Bovespa index down more than 3%.
Oil prices were lower, with West Texas Intermediate crude futures down $1.87 to $55.23 and gold futures settled up $13.70 to $1,527.80. Gold is up more than 6% in August and 19% on the year.
In seven of 11 trading days so far in August, the Dow has risen or fallen more than 275 points during the day. The violence and speed of moves up and down for the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq this month is likely due to computer algorithms making split-second buying and selling decisions."

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) on Wednesday said it boosted its stake in Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) by 11% during the second quarter, increasing its bet on the powerful online retailer even as stocks traded near record highs.
Berkshire said it ended June with 537,300 Amazon shares worth about $1.02 billion, up from 483,300 shares three months earlier.
It made the disclosure in a regulatory filing detailing the $208.1 billion of U.S.-listed stocks it owned as of June 30.
Buffett, the world's fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine, also drew attention in the quarter from fellow billionaire William Ackman, whose Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management revealed a $749 million Berkshire stake.
Berkshire's stock price is more than 12% below its record high set in October.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns more than 90 businesses such as the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream.
Berkshire had disclosed earlier this month that it sold more stocks than it bought during the quarter, suggesting possible concern among Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler about valuations.
Wednesday's filing includes investments by all three without saying who bought and sold what, though Buffett has said Combs or Weschler made the initial Amazon investment.
It was unclear whether Berkshire did any buying or selling on other exchanges during the quarter. Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The biggest investment to exit Berkshire's portfolio was a roughly $1.7 billion stake in USG, a wallboard maker acquired by Germany's Knauf KG in April.
Berkshire had agreed to sell its roughly 31 percent stake in USG, a nearly two-decade old investment that Buffett had labeled disappointing, as part of that merger.
The net selling contributed to Berkshire's ending June with a record $122.4 billion of cash and equivalents.
Berkshire invested $10 billion of that cash this month in Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY), which completed its takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).
Berkshire's biggest stock market commitment remains in financial services, where it is the largest shareholder in  American Express  Co (N:AXP), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and has a significant stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), where Combs is a director.

Department-store stocks plunged Wednesday following weak results and guidance from Macy’s (NYSE:M). The sharp selling came just a day after the Trump Administration’s delay of new tariffs on China, in part to safeguard holiday sales, lifted retailers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street sold off sharply on Wednesday as recession fears gripped the market after the U.S. Treasury yield curve temporarily inverted for the first time in 12 years. 
All three major U.S. indexes closed down about 3%, with the blue-chip Dow posting its biggest one-day point drop since October after 2-year Treasury yields surpassed those of 10-year bonds, which is considered a classic recession signal. 
Dire economic data from China and Germany suggested a faltering global economy, stricken by the increasingly belligerent U.S.-China trade war, Brexit woes and geopolitical tensions. 
Germany reported a contraction in second-quarter gross domestic product, and China's industrial growth in July hit a 17-year low.
""It was all negative and not much positive today,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""We're outside of the earnings season and markets are being batted around by news.""
""It's a reactionary market right now and probably will continue to be,"" Carlson added. ""My guess is we're probably in for this until after Labor Day."" 
Wednesday was the first time that yields for 2-year and 10-year Treasuries had inverted since June 2007, months before the onset of the great recession, which crippled markets for years.
The U.S. yield curve has inverted before every recession in the past 50 years.
""It could be different this time,"" Carlson said. ""When you've got $15 trillion in global government debt at negative yields, that's a new animal. 
""Even if it is accurate in foreshadowing a recession, that doesn't mean it's coming tomorrow,"" he added.
The CBOE volatility index, a gauge of investor anxiety, jumped 4.58 points to 22.10. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 800.49 points, or 3.05%, to 25,479.42, the S&P 500 lost 85.72 points, or 2.93%, to 2,840.6, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 242.42 points, or 3.02%, to 7,773.94.
Over 300 of the S&P 500's components are down 10% or more from their 52-week highs, according to Refinitiv data. More than 180 of those stocks have fallen more than 20% from their 52-week highs, putting them in bear market territory.
All of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 closed in negative territory, with energy, financials, materials, consumer discretionary and communications services all falling 3% or more. 
Interest rate-sensitive banks tumbled 4.3%. 
Macy's Inc's shares plunged 13.2% after the department store operator missed quarterly profit estimates and cut its full-year earnings estimates.
Rival department store operators  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) and Kohls Corp slid 10.6% and 11.0%, respectively.
A U.S. House of Representatives oversight panel called on Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd to turn over documents as part of a review into generic drug price increases.
Mylan fell 8.5% while U.S.-listed Teva shares dipped 10.5%.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) slid 4.6% on news that the European Union's lead regulator is investigating how the social media company handled data during the manual transcription of users' audio recordings.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 5.33-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and 51 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 23 new highs and 282 new lows.

Since the Montreal-based engineering firm would have benefited financially from Trudeau’s efforts, the prime minister’s actions contravened the act, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion said in a report released Wednesday in Ottawa. Trudeau is scheduled to speak to reporters at 2 p.m.
The watchdog’s reprimand is a blow to Trudeau, just 10 weeks ahead of an October election, and will bring renewed focus to what has been the most damaging scandal of his Liberal Party administration. The prime minister has seen his popularity sink this year amid accusations of judicial interference, though his poll numbers had been lately recovering, as the controversy settled over the summer.
Dion concludes Trudeau and his staff pressured the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to intervene in the legal case involving SNC. The Canadian leader has claimed he did nothing wrong and was only attempting to protect jobs, but the scandal cost him two high-profile cabinet ministers, including Wilson-Raybould, and his top aide.
The report doesn’t outline any sanctions related to the decision. “It is up to the Prime Minister to implement any further action,” it said.
Dion called Trudeau’s actions “troubling,” and said the evidence showed on at least four separate occasions that political interests were put before Wilson-Raybould, directly or indirectly.
“The authority of the Prime Minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as the authority of Ms. Wilson‑Raybould as the Crown’s chief law officer,” the commissioner said in the report.
It’s not the first time Trudeau has violated the act. In a separate 2017 decision, the ethics commissioner found Trudeau broke rules when he and his family vacationed on an island owned by the Aga Khan.
In a tweet, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer admonished Trudeau for being the first prime minister in history to be found guilty of breaking federal ethics laws.
Polling averages compiled by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. show the Conservatives and Liberals are statistically tied in voter intentions. After trailing the Liberals for most of the past four years, the Conservatives led by as much as seven percentage points at one point this summer.

193,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 04:34PM ET</span>","Wall Street Weighs If ViacomCBS Can Compete With Netflix, Disney","(Bloomberg) -- While there may be some relief now that CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS). and Viacom Inc. have finally settled on a merger plan, Wall Street’s attention has turned to whether the deal is enough to stem the bleeding subscriber declines plaguing the pay-TV industry.
Some analysts question if the estimated synergies of $500 million will be enough to compete with a market turning to streaming services. But “scale, after all, is a necessary (but not sufficient) first step to a robust [direct-to-consumer] offering,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a note to clients.
CBS fell as much as 7.7% Wednesday, the most since August 2015, while Viacom shares dropped as much as 7.9% to the lowest since March.
Still, there may be reasons to be optimistic. Bob Bakish -- crowned as ViacomCBS’s chief executive officer by Shari Redstone -- said Wednesday in a Bloomberg TV interview that the companies’ combined content library will be enough to join the ranks of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)., Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co., and others entering the streaming battle.

Here’s what analysts are saying:
Wolfe Research, Marci Ryvicker
Maintains outperform ratings with ViacomCBS price target at $63; cuts Viacom PT to $38 from $42.
“We feel the most underappreciated part of this deal is where ViacomCBS fits in the TV ecosystem. Most important, as all other content providers are pulling their libraries inhouse, ViacomCBS will remain a global provider of content.”
According to Ryvicker, the “two surprises relative to our expectations” were the name ViacomCBS as the presumed name was simply CBS, and also the exchange ratio given the thought that Viacom “would get some level of a premium.”
The exchange ratio was lower than expected, likely “to stave off shareholder lawsuits.”
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Jessica Reif Ehrlich
The firm raises CBS to buy from neutral and lifts price target to $63 from $58. Maintains Viacom buy rating; lowers target by $1 to $38.
“We see limited hurdles to the deal being completed” as National Amusements Inc. “has already consented to the deal and there appears to be limited potential competitive impact.”
The anticipated deal close time, slated for year-end 2019, is “arguably the only surprise in yesterday’s announcement.”
While the merger “does not fully address the long-term uncertainties” confronting CBS and Viacom’s assets centered around pay-TV, the deal offers a number of benefits from greater scale in content production to cost savings and improved negotiation leverage.
Citigroup, Jason Bazinet
Rates CBS a buy, lowers price target to $57 from $60.
“We see scant regulatory risks” to this deal, according to Bazinet, who anticipates a deal close by year’s end.
“As the pay-TV market slowly pivots to cloud-based direct-to-consumer offers, this deal makes sense.”
But in order for ViacomCBS “to benefit from multiple expansion, the management team will need to take bolder steps by, for example, putting the lion’s share of the content on a single, unified app.”
Loop Capital, Alan Gould
Buy, price target $65.
While Gould views the merger as “very attractive,” he says “the biggest question will be whether or not the combined company is big enough, or needs to make further acquisitions.”
“There are no surprises regarding management, economics or synergies. We continue to believe the pro forma 2020 estimated EPS will be approximately $7.25 assuming all synergies.”
“Shareholder litigation is the most likely issue that could slow down the deal.”
Benchmark, Daniel Kurnos
Buy rating, lowers price target to $68 from $71.
“After what felt like years in the making, CBS and Viacom finally announced that the band was, indeed, getting back together.”
“Given the amount of media attention surrounding the potential recombination, the big reveal was met with little fanfare and perhaps even a touch of disappointment at the initial synergy forecast of $500 million, although the latter will likely prove materially conservative as it contains no revenue, content or marketing benefits.”
Bernstein, Todd Juenger
CBS lowered to underperform from outperform as the thesis changes, cuts target to $46 from $62. Viacom also rated underperform with $27 price target.
“We believe whatever synergies are produced will pale in comparison to CBS shareholders inheriting Viacom’s structural problems.”
“More likely, we believe the pro forma company will invest the synergies in pursuit of some version of a DTC product – which we don’t believe would have meaningful consumer appeal.”
BMO Capital, Daniel Salmon
Downgrades to market perform from outperform, and lowers price target to $51 from $60."

The debt maturing next June has fallen to a record low of 71 cents on the dollar from 104 cents last Friday. The notes pay a floating coupon tied to the benchmark interest rate, which stood at an all-time high of 75% on Tuesday. Yet the peso’s tumble after a landslide defeat in the primaries for President Mauricio Macri outweighed any yield on the debt.
Pimco holds about 30% of the 142 billion pesos ($2.4 billion) of 2020 bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The investment firm had boosted its exposure earlier in the year before Argentina re-opened the bond sale.
Pimco has diversified its holdings “with more downside protection in an extreme market event” and “avoided larger exposures with greater losses that have impacted other major investors,” spokesman Michael Reid said.
Nominal returns for the notes have been huge in recent quarters, yet the peso’s status as a global laggard curbed real gains. The currency has weakened a world-leading 37% this year, and many analysts say it has much further to fall.
Pimco’s profits or losses on the bonds would depend significantly on the extent to which it hedged its foreign-exchange exposure. Reid declined to comment on the firm’s hedge position.
When Argentina issued the debt two years ago, the nation’s benchmark rate was a more modest 26% amid optimism that Macri would revive an economy that stagnated under his populist predecessor Cristina Kirchner. Now, the rate is almost triple that and Kirchner is expected to return to office as the vice president on front-runner Alberto Fernandez’s ticket.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments on Wednesday won its court battle with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service over tax credits for the production of chemically treated coal.
U.S. Tax Court Judge David Gustafson ruled at a court hearing that a partnership led by Boston-based Fidelity was bonafide in its pursuit of generating tax credits from the production of treated coal.
The case has been closely watched by Wall Street firms and other corporations because the production of chemically treated, or refined, coal generates more than $1 billion a year in tax credits.
At the hearing Gustafson said he disagreed with IRS arguments that Fidelity and its partners faced insignificant downside risk on their investment in refined coal facilities. The judge said the partnership endured prolonged facility shutdowns due to permitting problems and environmental contamination, for example.
Fidelity had invested in the production of refined coal at three South Carolina power plants to qualify for tax credits that could total up to $330 million over 10 years. The coal is treated with chemicals to cut mercury and smog pollution.
Fidelity's partners included insurance broker  Arthur J. Gallagher & Co  (N:AJG) and Schneider Electric SE. (PA:SCHN)
The IRS had disallowed millions of dollars in tax credits and claimed losses reported by a Fidelity-led partnership in 2011 and 2012. The IRS said the partnership was only created to ""facilitate the prohibited transaction of monetizing refined coal tax credits."""

A brief attempt at recovery ran out of gas. By 3 PM ET (19:00 GMT) the major averages were near their lows. The Dow had fallen as many as 782 points.
The S&P 500 was off 2.75%. The Dow Jones industrials were down 2.85%, and the Nasdaq Composite was off 2.9%.
The emotional catalyst came early in the day when the yield on the 10-Year Treasury note briefly fell below that of the 2-Year Treasury for the first time since 2007. That suggests investors were unwilling to commit money for longer-term investments.
The 10-year yield was at 1.581% at 1:30 PM ET while the 2-year yield was at 1.577%.
The market slump comes in the backdrop of the continuing trade fight between the United States and China, which has hit Chinese exports and exports of a number of U.S. products, especially soybeans.
Slumping exports sent Germany's economy into reverse in the second quarter, while Chinese industrial output growth cooled to a more-than-17-year low in July.
Interest rates globally have fallen as the scope of the slowdown has emerged. The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate on July 31 in the face of bitter criticism from President Donald Trump. The Fed is expected to cut rates again at its meeting in mid-September.
None of the Dow stocks was higher, although Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), both classic defensive stocks, were off only slightly. Boeing (NYSE:BA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) were the biggest contributors to the Dow's decline. Boeing's decline was worth 68 Dow points. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were all off at least 3%. 
Oil prices were lower and gold futures settled up $13.70 to $1,527.80. Gold is up more than 6% in August and 19% on the year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve temporarily inverted on Wednesday for the first time since June 2007 in a sign of investor concern that the world's biggest economy could be heading for recession.
The inversion - where shorter-dated borrowing costs are higher than longer ones - saw U.S. 2-year note yields rise above the benchmark 10-year yield, which fell to 1.574%, the lowest since September 2016.
U.S. 30-year yields also plunged, dropping to a record low of 2.015%.
The curve was last at 0.70 basis point after the inversion reversed.
Weak economic data and low inflation around the world, trade conflicts, and political tension in places such as Hong Kong have sparked worries about global growth, fueling market expectations of central bank interest rate cuts and triggering steep falls in government bond yields.
The U.S. curve inverted on Wednesday to as much as minus 2.1 basis points , a metric widely viewed as a classic recession signal. The last time this yield curve inverted was in June 2007 when the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was gathering pace.
The U.S. curve has inverted before every recession in the past 50 years, offering a false signal just once in that time.
GRAPHIC: U.S. Treasury curve inverts - https://tmsnrt.rs/2YLaA5f
Some market players though are not convinced an inverted yield curve will necessarily lead to recession.
""Certainly a yield curve inversion is not indicative of an imminent recession. If anything, it's probably 18 months out,"" said Gautam Khanna, senior portfolio manager at Insight Investment in New York.
Khanna believes U.S. economic numbers are still positive overall.
""The question is: What is going to drive an imminent recession, when you look at the data? You don't see that yet,"" Khanna said.

In afternoon trading, U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields (US10YT=RR) were last down at 1.597%, from 1.68% late on Tuesday.
Yields on 30-year bonds slid to 2.041% (US30YT=RR) from 2.137% on Tuesday.
While the yield on nominal 30-year bonds had not yet broken below 2%, Treasury futures market signals indicated an expectation it would do so soon. The implied yield on the 30-year Treasury futures contract expiring in September was 1.74% on Wednesday, near a record low.
""This latest move on the long end of the U.S. curve is sending the Fed a clear message: the notion of a slow, methodical 'mid-cycle adjustment' is very much in question, and at the same time so is the efficacy of lower rates to solve the issues at hand,"" said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities in New York.
At the short end of the curve, U.S. 2-year yields fell to 1.589% from Tuesday's 1.669% (US2YT=RR).
In March, the inversion of the U.S. yield curve hit 3-month T-bills for the first time in about 12 years when the yield on 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) dropped below that for 3-month securities.
That metric reverted back and then inverted again in May. Over that period, the 2- to 10-year curve did not invert."

Voting in recent days, union locals approved a four-year contract governing electrical workers, machinists, steelworkers, autoworkers, Teamsters and engineers, the two sides said.
""We now have a ratified four-year labor agreement with all of our unions,"" GE spokesman Jeff Caywood said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Wednesday.
Representatives of the IUE-CWA, the union that took the lead in negotiations, were not immediately available to comment. A statement posted on Wednesday on the union's website said all locals had approved the deal and 77 percent of members had voted.
GE improved its contract offer after workers narrowly rejected an earlier offer last month."

The inversion -- a situation where shorter-dated borrowing costs are higher than longer ones -- saw U.S. 2-year note yields rise above the 10-year bond yield.
The curve inverted to as much as minus 1.7 basis points by 1045 GMT .
(GRAPHIC - US Treasury curve inverts: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YLaA5f)
Such an inversion, considered a classic recession signal, occurred last in June 2007 when the U.S. sub-prime mortgage crisis was gathering pace (US2YT=RR) (US10YT=RR). The U.S. curve has inverted before every recession in the past 50 years, offering a false signal just once in that time.
""Historically the U.S. curve was always thought of as a recession signal and it remains to see if that's still the case. The world certainly seems a less safe place,"" said Tim Graf, chief macro strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
Weak economic data and inflation, global trade tensions and risks such as the consequences of Brexit have driven concern about world growth, fuelling market expectations of central bank rate cuts and sparking hefty falls in government bond yields.
The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield tumbled to a record low of 2.05% on Wednesday. In Germany, the 10-year bond yield fell to a record low of -0.64% after data showed the euro zone's powerhouse economy shrank in the second quarter.
""The yield curve inversion is a bad omen for the economy,"" said Arne Petimezas, an analyst at AFS in Amsterdam.
""Inversions in crucial segments of the yield curve have always heralded recessions. However, typically central banks ignore the warning signal. They often cut too little or too late.""
Elsewhere, yield curves have been less accurate in predicting downturns but Germany's was at its flattest since 2008 (DE2YT=RR) (DE10YT=RR).
Britain's bond yield curve also inverted on Wednesday for the first time since the global financial crisis .
In March, the inversion of the U.S. yield curve hit 3-month T-bills for the first time in about 12 years when the yield on 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) dropped below those for 3-month securities.
That metric reverted back and then inverted again in May. Over that period, the 2-/10-year curve did not invert.
Some have cast doubt on how accurate the yield curve remains as a recession predictor after a decade of multi-trillion dollar central bank money-printing stimulus.
Graf said the backdrop now was not a ""perfect apples to apples comparison"" to the last curve inversion episode, which happened just over a year before the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent the world economy into a tailspin.
""The supply-demand dynamics for safe assets are different and to some degree it explains why the curve inversion may last longer without portending recession, than during past episodes."""

205,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 03:09PM ET</span>",WeWork to test IPO investor appetite with widening losses,"By Joshua Franklin, Manas Mishra and Herbert Lash
(Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company published detailed financial statements for the first time on Wednesday, revealing breakneck revenue growth and soaring losses, as it prepares for an initial public offering as early as next month.
The IPO, which could raise several billion dollars, will be a key test of investor appetite for fast-growing, money-losing start-ups, at a time when global concerns about the potential for recession and the trade war between the United States and China are fueling stock market volatility.
Other high-profile IPOs this year, such as those of ride-hailing start-ups  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), have fared poorly after their launch, amid investor skepticism over their lack of a concrete plan to profitability.
""Large money-losing IPOs with high valuations tend to be challenging in the IPO market,"" said Kathleen Smith, founding principal at IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. ""IPO investors have already been burnt by Lyft and Uber. They are going to be cautious about WeWork.""
One of the risks We Company investors have to grapple with is a mismatch between the company's cash flow and liabilities. It rents out workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent for them itself under long-term leases.
""This is going to be an extremely volatile stock. Investors will debate whether this is a company that has a niche that's going to be very profitable, or if this is an overvalued real-estate company fraught with risks,"" said Jay Ritter, an IPO expert and professor at the University of Florida.
We Company, co-founded in 2010 by its chief executive, Adam Neumann, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it lost more than $900 million in the first half of 2019, up 25% from a year earlier, even as its revenue doubled to $1.54 billion.
The company is considering looking to raise $3 billion to $4 billion in the IPO and could launch its IPO investor road show the week after the U.S. Labor Day public holiday on Sept. 2, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
We Company's revenue has surged as the company shakes up office leasing by offering start-ups and entrepreneurs short-term contracts in lieu of traditional long-term leases. It also generates greater revenue per square foot than traditional landlords, by squeezing more workers into a property.
This has not yet translated into profits. As it continued to sign new leases at a rapid rate, We Company burned through $2.36 billion in cash in the first half of the year, more than twice the amount it spent in the same period last year. 
The company did not give a time frame for becoming profitable. After the IPO, Neumann, 40, will retain more than 50% of the company's voting power, leaving him with operational control of the business. 
This practice among startups has received some criticism from some IPO investors, who argue it undermines corporate governance. 
Neumann has not sold any shares of the company since October 2017 and does not plan to not sell shares in the IPO, We Company said in its filing.
We Company also disclosed it paid almost $17 million between 2016 and 2018 for leases on properties owned by Neumann. 
AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION
We Company, which operates 528 locations in 111 cities across 29 countries, said it expected to ""expand aggressively in our existing cities as well as launch in up to 169 additional cities.""
It was valued in January at $47 billion in a private fundraising round, according to data provider PitchBook. Its biggest backer is Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984), which has invested or committed to invest $10.65 billion since 2017.
Flexible office providers have dominated leasing in major gateway cities, most notably London, New York and San Francisco, a sign of growing demand by companies and not just the start-ups and entrepreneurs that put coworking on the map.
We Company also said it had obtained a new credit facility from a group of banks providing up to $6 billion to further fund its growth. Credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings downgraded WeWork's debt rating deeper into junk territory on Wednesday, citing underperformance relative to expectations at the time of the initial rating.
We Company has not yet disclosed how much it is looking to raise in the IPO and what valuation it will aim for. It intends to list under the symbol ""WE.""

J.P. Morgan Securities (N:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) are among a nine-member underwriting team for the IPO.

Osram on Wednesday called the negotiations ""constructive"", while AMS said talks were ""moving ahead in good faith"". 
Both companies said that they aim to start the tender period for the offer before the end of Sept. 5.
""Osram and AMS have held constructive discussions on a business combination agreement and on other topics since Tuesday and will continue to do so,"" Osram said in a statement.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 02:28PM ET</span>","Ford extends warranties on 560,000 Focus, Fiesta models","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Wednesday it was extending warranties on clutch and related hardware in 560,000 Focus and Fiesta cars in the United States and Canada after reports of problems with their six-speed transmission.
The company said it would reimburse any repair charges to customers of 2014 through 2016 model cars, and offer other owners another chance to get a software update to fix the issue.
The problems with the cars' automatic transmission DPS6 - made to improve the vehicle's fuel economy - include a degree of vibration when the transmission is operated at low speed, and a potential for the transmission to default to neutral.
""Ford understands and regrets that many customers have been inconvenienced and frustrated by the performance of the DPS6 transmission,"" said Dave Filipe, vice president of power train engineering at Ford.
The company declined to reveal how much it would cost to offer the extended warranties and said the decision was independent of news reports or lawsuits related to the issue.
The announcement means warranty coverage for these vehicles is the same that has been in place since July 2014 for older Focus and Fiesta cars.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Wednesday it ""has reviewed recent complaints and other data associated with"" the customer satisfaction campaigns announced by Ford intended to address reports involving shuddering and loss of power.
""Based on a review of this information, and other information including severity and frequency, NHTSA has not found evidence of an unreasonable risk to safety,"" the agency said adding it ""will continue to monitor complaints and other data, maintain communication with Ford, and take action as necessary."" 

In 2017, Ford settled a class-action lawsuit over the transmissions and agreed to pay owners of 2011-2016 Ford Fiesta or 2012-2016 Ford Focus vehicles up to $2,325 to compensate them for prior repair costs and other provisions. That settlement is pending until a federal appeals court decides whether to uphold it.

212,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 01:54PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Traders Say 'No' to Weed Stocks Following Tilray's Wider Loss,"Investing.com – Tilray slumped Wednesday after more than tripling its cannabis sales in the second quarter, but at lower prices, prompting a wider-than-expected loss, leaving traders with little choice but to say ""no"" to weed stocks. 
Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) reported a net loss of $0.36 a share, below consensus estimates from Investing.com for a net loss of $0.26 a share, sending the company’s shares about 14% lower. Tilray is down about 43% for the year so far. 
Revenue, meanwhile, surged 371% to $45.9 billion, well above estimates of $40.35 billion. The company attributed the growth to a boost from hemp-foods producer Manitoba Harvest, which it acquired in February, the legalization of the Canadian adult-use market and growth in international medical markets, particularly in Europe.
The trip-digit revenue growth, however, was offset by surging costs and a fall in the price of weed sold per gram. 
Cost of sales jumped to $33.63 billion compared to $5.57 billion a year earlier.
The average net selling price per gram decreased to $4.61 compared to $6.38 in the prior year period, with the company blaming the decline on a reduced mix of higher-priced extract products and a greater mix of lower-priced adult use.
Surging revenue growth combined with wider losses are not uncommon as cannabis producers continue to invest to ramp up manufacturing. But the decline in average selling prices raised fears of a possible oversupply, triggering a sea of red across weed stocks. 
  Cronos   Group (NASDAQ:CRON), Canopy Growth (TSX:WEED) and   Aurora Cannabis   (TSX:ACB) were all nursing heavy losses for the day.
Canopy Growth’s fiscal first quarter results – due today after the closing bell – will likely provide investors with further insight into the supply-and-demand dynamics within the industry. "

221,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 12:58PM ET</span>","Dow transport average struggles to keep pace, could be market warning sign","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Transportation Average is struggling to get into gear and that could be a sign the market is ready to stall further.
The 20-component index of rail operators, airlines, truckers and package delivery stocks is seen by many investors as a barometer of economic activity, and it is failing to keep up with other key market measures.
The Dow transports (DJT) slumped more than 2% on Wednesday, in line with declines for the broader market, as a closely watched bond market indicator pointed to a renewed risk of recession. Yields on U.S. 2-year Treasury notes rose above the 10-year yield on Wednesday, the first such inversion of the yield curve since June 2007, a potential warning sign for investors.
While other major U.S. averages have set all-time highs in 2019 amid a broad equities rally, the Dow transports only came within 4% of its Sept. 14 record, doing so on April 24. Since then, the transports are down more than 10%, and more than 14% from its September record. 
(Graphic - Dow transport index performance: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YO4QaJ) 
The 123-year-old Dow transport average has climbed 8% this year, and more than 14% since Dec. 24, when the overall market made a recent bottom. But those gains have trailed other major indexes; for example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) is up about 10% in 2019 and 18% from Dec. 24.
(Graphic - Rebounding off the bottom: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YOVdsD)
The Dow transports are often analyzed relative to the Dow industrials to determine the overall direction of the market. When compared to the Dow industrials, the Dow transports are around their lowest level since 2012.
(Graphic - Dow transports vs Dow industrials: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YPGtcX)
""For us, they represent a confirmation of the primary trend,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""And if you don’t have the transports in sync with the industrials and other major indices, that’s an economy that’s a little out of sync and that’s a stock market that's a little out of sync.""
Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said the divergence of the transports is a sign the broad market could be due for a steeper pullback. Maley said the market could test the lows from early June, which are 5% below current levels.
""The stock market is a leading indicator for the economy and the transports are even better because they are a leading indicator for the stock market,"" Maley said.
Shares of railroad stocks, which account for nearly one-third of the weight in the Dow transports, have helped lift the performance of the overall index. As of Tuesday,  Union Pacific  (N:UNP) shares had climbed 22% in 2019, while Kansas City Southern (N:KSU) shares gained more than 25%.
But some rail shares, including CSX (O:CSX) and  Norfolk Southern  (N:NSC), have struggled in the past month, and the S&P 500 railroads industry group <.SPLRCRAIL> earlier this month began trading below its 200-day moving average, a key technical indicator for trends, for the first time since January.
""That was the one area in the transportations that was holding up and now it’s rolling over,” Maley said.
(Graphic - Dow transports winners and losers: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YLVmwH)
Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at Abbot Downing in Minneapolis, said the transports' performance could be a misleading indicator, because of certain ""one-off"" issues hurting shares of various components in the index.
For example, Schleif points to Boeing's (N:BA) grounding of its 737 MAX jet hitting airlines and Amazon (O:AMZN) posing a competitive threat to logistics companies.
""Most of the broad economic numbers would tend to indicate an economy that is still chugging along pretty well,"" Schleif said.
But several indicators, including some that ripple directly through to transports, show caution.
The Cass Freight index recorded a 5.3% year-over-year decline in June, the index's seventh straight month with a negative reading on a year-over-year basis. Cargo volumes at the Port of Long Beach, a key hub for U.S. ocean trade with China, last month fell from a year earlier, and for the year are down 7.2% from the same period a year ago.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>","Macy's shares sink as discounts to clear inventory hurt, tourism drops","By Aishwarya Venugopal and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) cut its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday after missing estimates for quarterly profit for the first time in at least two years, as it discounted merchandise heavily to clear spring inventory, sending its shares down as much as 18%.
The largest U.S. department store operator, whose flagship building in Manhattan is a major tourist attraction, blamed a bigger-than-expected decline in tourist spending for the shortfall along with weak demand for its own-brand women's sportswear and for warm weather apparel.
""We had a slow start to the quarter and finished below our expectations,"" Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said in a statement.
Tourist arrivals to the United States have taken a hit in the past year, hurt by a stronger dollar and escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, denting the number of Chinese visitors to the country. 
The number of Chinese citizens arriving in the United States dipped 2.8% in the first six months of the year, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office.
Like its peers, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based retailer, which has closed more than 100 stores since 2015 and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic plummeted, faltered in the past few years as it struggled to adjust to a fiercely competitive retail landscape where shoppers buy more goods online at places like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
""While they are controlling what they can control, the headwinds from both macro and micro factors continue to grow, creating a challenging backdrop for CEO Jeff Gennette to manage through,"" said Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom. ""The good news is that they have a plan.""
The 160-year-old company is pumping money into projects such as remodeling its stores and building up its off-price and online businesses. Macy's also announced a partnership with fashion resale marketplace thredUP, aimed at helping the chain ""reach a new customer and keep them coming back to shop...,"" the company said. 
Retailers like Macy's have been burdened by a long-drawn trade war between the United States and China, which U.S. President Donald Trump escalated earlier this month by threatening to impose 10% tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods from Sept. 1. On Tuesday, the Trump administration delayed the 10% tariffs on some Chinese goods until Dec. 15.
Macy's executives reassured investors on a post-earnings call Wednesday that the company is in ""active discussions"" with vendors and suppliers to mitigate tariffs and minimize customer impact in 2019 as much as possible.
Analysts said the temporary tariff reprieve would likely not benefit retailers greatly.
""Only a small percentage of soft-good tariffs are actually getting delayed until December 15th and none have been removed yet,"" UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote in a note, adding that, of the approximately 789 apparel and footwear categories on the original latest list of tariffs, only 17% have had tariffs delayed.
Gennette said he believed 10% tariffs to be manageable but that it would be harder to maintain pricing if 25% tariffs are imposed on all remaining imports from China, adding ""there's no customer appetite for price increases.""
Macy's now expects 2019 adjusted profit to be between $2.85 per share to $3.05 per share, down from a previous forecast of $3.05 to $3.25.
The company's margins in the quarter fell to 38.8% from 40.4% a year earlier, hit hard by steep markdowns.
For the second quarter ended Aug. 3, net income attributable to Macy's shareholders slumped 48% to $86 million, or 28 cents per share.
Analysts on average had expected the company to earn 45 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net sales fell marginally to $5.55 billion, largely in line with estimates, while sales at its established stores rose 0.3%.
Still, Macy's, whose digital business posted its fortieth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, maintained its 2019 sales expectations, and said it entered the fall season with the ""right inventory.""
Macy's shares, which have declined about 35% this year, opened at a near 10-year low. Shares were down about 15% at $16.50 in afternoon trading Wednesday.

The company, which is the first of the department stores to report results, also dragged down peers' shares. Kohl's (N:KSS), Nordstrom (N:JWN) and J.C. Penney (N:JCP) were down between 8% and 11%.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 10:42AM ET</span>",Air Canada sees A220 jet delivering boost for key U.S. transit traffic,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Air Canada said on Wednesday it will launch a direct Seattle-Montreal service in May 2020 with its new A220-300 jets, as the carrier eyes new routes to expand its share of lucrative international transit traffic to and from the United States. 
Airbus SE's smallest commercial jet, expected to enter Air Canada's fleet in December with its first delivery, will help the carrier open new routes and increase capacity to cities that lack enough traffic to warrant a larger plane, Canada's largest carrier said.
""The economics that come with this aircraft allow Air Canada to open new routes that you couldn't serve profitably,"" Mark Galardo, the Montreal-based carrier's vice president of network planning, said in an interview.
Air Canada will use the fuel-efficient 137-seat jet, developed by Bombardier Inc, to help attract U.S. passengers flying through its Canadian hubs, Galardo said.
The Montreal-Seattle route, starting May 4, will allow U.S. passengers to connect to destinations in Europe and North Africa.
""Part of our business case for the route is having some Seattle-to-Europe traffic (connect) via Montreal,"" Galardo said.
Air Canada also said it will begin A220 service on May 4 between Toronto and San Jose, California.
The so-called sixth-freedom right of an airline to carry passengers or cargo from a second country to a third country, provided it touches down in its home country, is key to Air Canada's international growth strategy because of Canada's limited population.
The carrier said in February it aimed to expand its market share of U.S. international transit traffic to 2% from a current estimated 1.3%, although it had not set a target date. Hitting the target would generate an additional C$675 million ($510.36 million) in annual revenue, Air Canada said during an investor day presentation.
Galardo declined to say what proportion of passengers on Air Canada's international flights come from the United States. 
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is the A220's largest customer, having ordered 95 jets, which have about 110 to 130 seats.
Air Canada, which ordered 45 A220 jets, expects to have 10 to 11 planes in service by the summer of 2020, Galardo said. 

The jets will be used to replace existing aircraft and will not help Air Canada secure capacity in the wake of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX grounding. The carrier has taken its 24 grounded MAX jets out of its schedule until Jan. 8, 2020.

The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury (US10YT=RR) note tipped 1.4 basis points below 2-year Treasury yields (US2YT=RR), the first time this spread has been negative since 2007, which was the end of a trend of negative yield curves that started in 2005, according to Refinitiv data.
A yield curve typically has an upward slope -- when the yields are plotted on a graph -- because investors expect greater compensation for the risk of owning longer-maturity debt. An inversion, when shorter-dated yields are higher than longer-dated ones, is considered a warning of a looming recession.

With inverted yield curves widely viewed on Wall Street as a major danger signal for the economy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) warned this week that Wall Street's decade-long rally is also under threat.
Inversions of the 2- and 10-year Treasury curve have preceded major sell-offs on Wall Street. With the S&P 500 (SPX) hitting record highs in July and up over 300% since the 2009 low following the financial crisis, the bull market's vulnerability is coming into sharp relief.
""The equity market is on borrowed time after the yield curve inverts. However, after an initial post-inversion dip, the S&P 500 can rally meaningfully prior to a bigger US recession related drawdown,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in a report on Monday.
After previous inversions since the 1950s, the S&P 500 has typically fallen about 5% over one or two months, followed by a ""last gasp"" rally of an average of 17% and lasting about seven months, according to Bank of America.
The chart below shows that stocks in some cases continued to grind higher for many months after the yield curve inverted. Since 1980, stocks delivered positive one-year returns following yield curve inversions. It is only three years out from the inversion that stocks have registered significant losses.

S&P 500 corrections related to recessions average 32% and tend to last just over a year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The graphic below shows that the S&P 500 had a negative three-year performance following yield curve inversions in 2000 and 2006, but not in the 1980s.
(GRAPHIC - Yield curve inversions, recessions & U.S. stocks: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YOtvft)
The spread between U.S. 2-year and 10-year note yields has slipped below zero before each of the last five U.S. recessions, although it has taken anywhere from 12 to 24 months for the recession to occur. The curve's inversion often ended before a recession began, and the inversions did not predict the length or severity of an economic downturn.
U.S. central bankers and many other economists and investors have said that an inverted yield curve would be most concerning if it lasts for a prolonged period.
""It needs to stay there for a while, typically a quarter or two, for it to have predictive value,"" said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust in Philadelphia.
After the curve last inverted in December 2005, the S&P 500 kept rising through the next year before tumbling by 2009 to around 35% below its levels prior to the yield curve inversion. By 2010 the S&P 500 had recovered, although financials remained down over 40%.
(GRAPHIC - 2005 yield curve inversion: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YP8IZl)
Prior to that, the yield curve inverted in 2000 during the dot-com bubble. By early 2003, the S&P 500 had fallen about 40%, and it was still down almost 20% five years later. By 2005, technology stocks were still down close to 80%.

In March, the gap between 3-month T-bills and 10-year notes inverted for the first time in about 12 years. That metric, which some economists focus more on than on the 2-year and 10-year spread, reverted back and then inverted again in May. It is now trading at negative 37 basis points."

242,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 09:42AM ET</span>","Canadian pension giant plans hiring spree in Asia, Europe","By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, one of the world's biggest pension funds, plans to hire ""extensively"" in Asia and Europe over the next two years and could shift an extra C$11 billion ($8.3 billion) into infrastructure and other real assets, its chief executive told Reuters.
The fund currently employs around 1,200 people across hub offices in Toronto, London and Hong Kong, while a further 1,500 work at real estate subsidiary Cadillac Fairview.
Outgoing Chief Executive Ron Mock told Reuters that Ontario Teachers' (OTPP) could triple its current Asia headcount of around 25 people and is considering opening offices in Mumbai and Singapore.
OTPP managed around C$191 billion ($144 billion) in assets as of the end of 2018 for 327,000 working and retired teachers.
Mock said China, India, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines were all areas likely to see further investment.
""We plan on growing our European and Asian operations extensively,"" said Mock.
""Asia represents a growth opportunity over the next 10-15 years... you can't just set up on a dime and take down on a dime when you're investing in private assets like private equity and infrastructure.""
Despite political turmoil in Britain as the country inches closer to leaving the European Union, Mock said London would remain its European base and headcount could rise from around 30 to more than 50 over the next two years.
""London remains, and will remain, our home base for the UK and for Europe,"" said Mock.
OTPP said in July that Mock would be replaced on Jan. 1, 2020 as chief executive by Jo Taylor, who has previously led the teams in both Europe and Asia.
Brexit fears have not prompted OTPP to withdraw or postpone investment in Britain, Mock added.
OTPP is set to release its half-year results on Aug. 21.
While much of its money is spread across a range of public and private assets, Mock said OTPP was spending a lot of its time sourcing deals in infrastructure and private equity.
Currently, around 17% of OTPP's assets are invested in Europe, with around 60% of that - some C$10 billion - in Britain, largely in private assets including lottery operator Camelot and Bristol airport.
Despite being keen to add to its real asset and private equity holdings in Europe and Britain, strong competition from other institutional investors meant securing the best deals was tough.
""It's not easy, at this point in time, given pricing, particularly in infrastructure and (a) few other spots,"" he said, but overall, the allocation to real assets would go up. At the end of December, OTPP's allocation to real estate, infrastructure and other 'real-rate' assets was 25%, or C$49.6 billion.

""We are opening up our asset mix to allow it to range from 26% to 32% of the total fund, and so we will be looking at... probably moving up somewhere in the neighborhood of C$11 billion"".

Investors should start to accumulate these shares, funding this by booking profit on rand hedges that benefited from weakness in the currency, while keeping South Africa at benchmark levels in an emerging-market portfolio, London-based Alexander Redman and Arun Sai wrote in a note.
Negative sentiment has reduced domestic South African stocks to the cheapest compared with emerging-market peers in almost a decade on a price-to-future-earnings basis, the analysts said. They offer a dividend yield 56% higher than the emerging-market aggregate, while rand hedges yield less than half that of developing nation shares.
There are reasons to be more optimistic, the Credit Suisse analysts said. They expect some appreciation in the rand, while predictions about South African economic growth are overly pessimistic. Sturdier household finances suggest consumer spending may recover, while the earnings outlook for domestic companies is improving. Plus, there’s evidence that heavy foreign selling of South African assets may almost be done.
South African value stocks creating yield plays include First Rand Ltd., Standard Bank Group Ltd., Vodacom Group Ltd., Sanlam Ltd., Nedbank Group Ltd., RMB Holdings Ltd., Exxaro Resources Ltd. and Mr Price Group Ltd., the analysts said.
“During our June/July investor roadshow we noted that the intensity of questions we fielded relating to domestic South Africa from emerging equity managers had discernibly increased relative to previous trips,” they wrote."
247,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 09:17AM ET</span>",Looking to Add Risk? Try Canada as Profit Outlook Hits Record,"(Bloomberg) -- Slowing global growth and the threat of a drawn-out trade war between the two largest economies have impacted corporate profits across the world. Not so in Canada, where equity bulls have boosted their earnings expectations to a record high.
Strategists are expecting profits for companies listed on the benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index to climb to C$1,143 ($864) a share for 2019 thanks to the nation’s expanding economy, stronger commodity prices and a solid earnings season that’s currently underway.
And even as yield curves invert in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. -- triggering yet another global recession warning -- profit forecasts on Canada’s benchmark index have risen at a faster pace than that of a gauge of developed-market equities.
“The difference starts with the macro picture,” Samantha Azzarello, global market strategist for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) ETFs, said in a phone interview. “Strength in the underlying economy, which even took the Bank of Canada by surprise, is feeding into the profit and sales outlook for Canadian companies.”
In the U.S., companies have slashed their forecasts at the fastest rate in four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The overall macro growth is slowing and that concern has been feeding into analysts’ expectations for U.S. earnings, Azzarello said. “You contrast that with Canada, GDP growth is actually stronger than most people thought.”
Companies listed on Canada’s benchmark index have beat estimates by about 6% on average, the most in a year. More than 80% of S&P/TSX companies have reported results, according to Bloomberg data. And about two-thirds of those firms have posted profits that beat estimates, including pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. and mortgage lender Home Capital Group Inc.
Business executives in Canada were also positive in the second quarter on the outlook for future sales despite concern about global trade headwinds, according to the latest bank of Canada survey. The composite gauge of sentiment turned positive, after dropping to its lowest since 2016 earlier this year.
Guidance provided by Canadian companies has been “relatively good,” said Bruce Campbell, founder of StoneCastle Investment Management Inc. “If you look on aggregate, they all seem to think that things are going to be fairly good. That’s a function of the economy.”
The Risks
There’s still some uncertainty that could hinder the growth in profits. While most Canadian companies may not be directly impacted by the U.S.-China trade war, a slowdown in the economic growth south of the border will hit corporations up north.
“The U.S. is still our largest trading partner. If they slow down, so does Canada,” said Laura Lau, senior portfolio manager at Brompton Corp. “We supply many U.S. companies in the supply chain.”
The slump in oil prices will also impact earnings. “The decline in oil prices is definitely going to weigh on profitability in the energy sector. And energy is still the second-largest sector whether you’re looking at the TSX or MSCI Canada,” Azzarello said.
There’s also the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, or USMCA, that still needs approval from Congress. “That’s a huge risk,” Azzarello said. “No one’s talking about it just because we’re all so focused on U.S.-China trade and so is the U.S. but that’s going to be on the docket at some point,” she added.
Canadian banks have yet to report earnings. Financials are the largest contributors to the S&P/TSX, with a 31% weighting. “We do not expect Q3 results to resolve the conflict between the pessimism and optimism surrounding the macroeconomic environment,” said CIBC analyst Robert Sedran in an Aug. 12 report. “We do expect to see growth,” of about 6% for the banks. “The best of a lacklustre year so far,” he noted.
Royal Bank of Canada is the first to report results on Aug. 21 and CIBC comes out the following day. The rest of the Big Six report the week of Aug. 26.
Still, strategists expect Canadian stocks to keep climbing, albeit at a slower pace than the first half of the year. The equity gauge has gained 14% so far in 2019. JPMorgan sees low-to-mid-single digit returns in the second half, while StoneCastle’s Campbell sees a further climb from current levels while bracing for more volatility.

248,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 09:14AM ET</span>",De Beers Will Let Buyers Reject More Diamonds to Fend Off Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- De Beers will let buyers reject more diamonds at a sale next week as the mining company shows almost unprecedented flexibility to ease a growing crisis.
The  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc unit has told customers they can refuse to buy half of the stones offered that are smaller than three-quarters of a carat, according to people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. Buyers will also get the option to sell back some diamonds to De Beers on favorable terms, the people said.
De Beers’s greater flexibility comes as high stocks of polished gems and a tightening of bank financing cuts margins for polishers, traders and cutters, with many saying they can’t make money on rough diamonds sold by the company. At the same time, demand for diamond jewelry is stagnant.
“De Beers is working harder to offer its customers flexibility to try to tackle short-term issues,” said Anish Aggarwal, a partner at specialist diamond advisory firm Gemdax. “But in the longer term, it’s about aligning the rough situation with polished demand.”
De Beers sells its gems through 10 sales each year in Botswana’s capital, Gaborone, and the buyers -- known as sightholders -- have to accept the price and the quantities they’re offered. The sightholders are given a black and yellow box containing plastic bags filled with stones, with the number of boxes and quality of diamonds depending on what the buyer and De Beers agreed in an annual allocation.
This year, buyers have grown increasingly frustrated with the cost of rough diamonds sold by De Beers as the prices of polished gems slumped. The company’s first-half profit dropped about 30% as sales declined.
De Beers has responded by letting sightholders lower their annual quotas and defer purchases. Chief Executive Officer Bruce Cleaver said last month that he accepts it’s not an easy time for clients, but that the company sees no structural problems in the industry.
In the sale next week, De Beers will let so-called buybacks increase to 20%, the people said, meaning sightholders can remove up to a fifth of the diamonds in a box and De Beers will lower the price by a similar amount. The measure could allow buyers to increase profits since the rejected stones tend to offer the slimmest margins.
An oversupply of smaller stones at the bottom end of the market has led to the collapse in the value of many smaller diamond producers."

250,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 08:58AM ET</span>",Tencent’s Revenue Misses as ByteDance Chips Away at Ad Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s comeback is taking a little longer than expected.
China’s leading social media and gaming company posted disappointing revenue growth after rivals like ByteDance Inc. siphoned off advertising. Online ad revenue grew a worse-than-expected 16% as the internet wunderkind undercut Tencent’s efforts to load more ads into its WeChat super-app.
The social media giant is trying to bounce back from a horrendous 2018, when a regulatory clampdown walloped its marquee games business. While regulators are again green-lighting games after last year’s freeze -- including Tencent’s breakout hit of 2019, Peacekeeper Elite -- they’re doing so at a slower pace. The emergence of a formidable competitor in ByteDance, the world’s most valuable startup, has also exacerbated the cooling effect on marketing spending of a sputtering Chinese economy.
“Tencent’s advertisement revenue was disappointing, partly due to competition from ByteDance,” said Canaan Guo, an analyst at Pacific Epoch. “Even though WeChat increased its ad inventory, it wasn’t able to fully sell its ad space because it charges more than rivals.”
Shares in Naspers Ltd., which as Tencent’s biggest shareholder is a proxy for the Chinese company when Hong Kong is closed, slid 2.8% in Johannesburg. Tencent reported revenue of 88.8 billion yuan ($12.7 billion), lagging the 93.4 billion yuan average analyst estimate. While sales of social media ads and “others” jumped 28%, media ad revenue slid 7% because of unexpected delays in the airing of certain drama series.

Tencent blamed “the challenging macro environment and increased supply of short video advertising inventories across the industry,” according to its exchange filing. “We expect the negative impact from the current business environment will persist in the second half of 2019.”
Tencent can still accelerate growth, riding Peacekeeper Elite as well as older, durable titles such as Honour of Kings. It released 10 games in the second quarter. To fend off ByteDance, it’s adding content and services to its WeChat social media super-app, partnering with the likes of Q&A platform Zhihu and funneling more of its 1 billion-plus users to mini-programs -- lite apps that offer third-party services from ride-hailing and food delivery to bike sharing. WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging service that acts as a gateway to those activities, grew users 7% to 1.1 billion.
“We expect gaming revenue to re-accelerate starting from the second quarter onward,” said David Dai, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bernstein, adding this would also drive an acceleration of overall revenue.
Net income rose a better-than-expected 35% to 24.1 billion yuan in the three months ended June, but that was boosted by gains of more than 4 billion yuan partly from the rising valuation of investees. The company is one of China’s most prolific tech investors, and in past years has acquired slices of major startups from ride-sharing giant Didi and on-demand services firm Meituan to video site Kuaishou. Hunkering down for tougher times, selling and marketing expenses dived 26%.
Some of Tencent’s younger divisions came through. The fintech and business services group -- a newly formed unit that includes cloud and payments -- grew revenue 37% to 22.9 billion yuan. Its Licaitong wealth management platform, which competes with rival Chinese billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Financial, had accumulated 800 billion yuan of customers assets by the end of June.
The company however still derives the lion’s share of its revenue from gaming. Tencent’s biggest hit of 2019 -- bereft of much of the violence typical of duel-to-the-death titles, to appease regulators -- is expected to generate $1 billion in revenue by the end of the year, according to gaming consultant Niko Partners. It pays tribute to China’s air force and Tencent sought out the country’s military recruitment arm for advice during development. It’s snagged more than 50 million daily active users since the title launched, Tencent said.
The game should have brought in $49 million of revenue in May and June, or about two thirds of the revenue generated by long-time favorite Honour of Kings, Bernstein’s Dai said. He estimates that Tencent’s gaming revenue growth could surpass 20% in the third and fourth quarters.
Shares of Tencent rose 1.8% in Hong Kong before earnings were announced. Adjusted earnings per share were 2.46 yuan, surpassing the 2.39 yuan average projection."

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets slumped on Wednesday as Germany's economy went into reverse, fueling fears of global recession and slamming the brakes on a rally for equities after Washington delayed tariffs on some Chinese imports. 
Europe's biggest economy shrank 0.1% in the second quarter as the trade war and weak demand dragged on German manufacturers. The euro zone as a whole barely grew in the same quarter, with the 19-country bloc adding 0.2% - a slowdown from the first three months of the year. 
The Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 1%. Markets in London (FTSE), Frankfurt (GDAXI) and Paris (FCHI) lost between 0.8% and 1.5%. Wall Street futures gauges were also indicating losses of around 0.7%.
The MSCI world equity index , which tracks shares in 47 countries, lost 0.2%, surrendering by late morning its earlier gains. Bond markets, too, were flashing warning signals of recession. 
The gap between U.S. two-year and 10-year Treasury yields - a metric closely watched for signs of a slowdown - inverted for the first time since 2007, raising the specter of a global recession.

""The telling thing is that there is a delayed effect - traditionally you see a one-to-two-year lag before a recession. You could see it next year,"" said Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com.
""The fact that 2s10s has also gone this way is a massive red warning light for the U.S. economy,"" he said, referring to the inverted yield of U.S. Treasuries.
The gap between UK two- and 10-year bonds also inverted for the first time in over a decade, while U.S. 30-year bonds and German 10-year bunds fell to record lows. 
The German figures - along with data showing the slowest growth for Chinese industrial output in 17 years that indicated faltering demand in the world's second-largest economy - knocked the wind out the sails for stocks and gave rise to the angst over a slowdown. 
Equity investors on Wall Street and in Asia had cheered earlier when U.S. President Donald Trump pushed back to December a Sept. 1 deadline for new tariffs on remaining Chinese imports.
The S&P 500 (SPX), which had fallen 1% on Monday, rose 1.5% overnight, buoying Asian stocks outside Japan by 0.5%. Benchmarks in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul all mirrored the surge in U.S. stocks.
But the momentum ebbed in Europe, as optimism faded that Trump's move meant tensions were easing and Germany's slowdown showed the damage already done by the trade war. 
""The trade war and the dispute between U.S. and China has already had an impact - especially when you look at countries most sensitive to global trade like Germany and even Italy,"" said Christophe Barraud, chief economist and strategist at Market Securities in Paris.
In another sign the trade dispute is hampering growth, China's industrial output slowed more than expected in July. Its 4.8% growth was the lowest since February 2002.
The Japanese yen , considered a safe haven, gained 0.6% to 106.13 per dollar, as the Chinese data underscored the effects of the trade war on the powerhouse economy. 
Mirroring that view, the offshore Chinese yuan  fell 0.4% against the dollar to 7.0337, erasing gains made the day before and remaining weaker than the 7 to the dollar it reached last week.

In commodity markets, oil prices fell after the Chinese data from China and a rise in U.S. crude inventories, erasing some of the gains made after Trump's tariff delay. 
Brent crude was down 80 cents, or 1.4%, at $60.47 a barrel at 1053 GMT, after rising 4.7% on Tuesday, its biggest percentage gain since December.

253,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 08:37AM ET</span>",Lion Air 'urgently requires' more 737 MAX jets to support growth: co-founder,"By Cindy Silviana
BATAM, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia's Lion Air ""urgently requires"" more  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX jets to support its growth strategy once regulators approve the grounded model's return to service, the airline's co-founder, Rusdi Kirana, told Reuters on Wednesday.
He said the low-cost airline, which had previously threatened to cancel its order for 187 jets worth $21 billion at list prices, would need to be satisfied with the outcome of negotiations with Boeing before taking the planes.
""If they don't satisfy us, we will cancel the contract,"" Kirana said.
All 189 passengers and crew on board one of Lion Air's new 737 MAX jets died when the plane crashed into the Java Sea last October, the first of two deadly crashes that led to the craft being grounded worldwide.
In April, Kirana lashed out over Boeing's handling of the accidents and accused the U.S. manufacturer of looking down on the airline as one from the ""third world"", even though it is one of the plane maker's largest customers globally.
A final report on the Lion Air crash is expected to be released at the end of September, Indonesia's civil aviation authority said last week.
Boeing is working to finalize a software fix of issues with an anti-stall system called MCAS that activated on the two crashed jets. Regulators will then need to approve the model's return to service before airlines take more of the planes.
Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA) is also in talks with Boeing about changes to its order for 49 737 MAX jets, its chief executive, Ari Askhara, told Reuters on Wednesday on the sidelines of an event to announce a maintenance joint venture with Lion Air.

Lion Air and Garuda maintenance arm GMF AeroAsia (JK:GMFI) plan to invest 10 trillion rupiah ($702.10 million) by 2028 to build a hangar on the island of Batam near Singapore alongside existing Lion Air facilities. Construction is due to begin this year, the airlines said.

They follow on the heels of national carrier Thai Airways' (BK:THAI), which reported last week that its losses more than doubled in the second quarter.
Bangkok Airways said late on Tuesday that its second-quarter loss amounted to 698 million baht, against an 82 million baht loss for the same period a year earlier. 
The airline's president, Puttipong Prasarttong-Osoth, said on Wednesday that the carrier's revenue dropped 4.2% due to slow growth in international tourist arrivals and the strengthening of the Thai baht, adding that in the second half of the year the carrier aims to increase online ticket sales via e-commerce platforms like Shopee (N:SE).
Tourist arrivals in Thailand in June rose just 0.89% from a year earlier, with visitors from China, Thailand's biggest source of tourists, declining 7.1%. 
State-run  Thai Airways  reported last Friday a 6.8 billion baht ($221 million) loss for April-June, against 3.1 billion baht in the second quarter of last year, blaming slow growth in tourism and intense price competition. 
However, Thai Airways said that the government's decision to waive visa fees until October could attract more visitors during the low season.
The airline aims to increase revenue through digital marketing and sales via its app, the airline's president, Sumeth Damrongchaitham, said on Tuesday.
The carrier said it would finance its planned procurement of 38 new planes to increase capacity by using internal cash flow, loans or issuing new shares. 
Low-cost carrier, Nok Air Pcl (BK:NOK) reported a 796 million baht second-quarter loss due to a fleet reduction and a decrease in Chinese tourists, it said. 
Rival no-frills airline  Asia Aviation  Pcl (BK:AAV), which owns Thai AirAsia, booked on Friday a 879 million baht loss for the quarter due to fewer Chinese tourists and a strong baht, which tempered demand from foreign tourists. 
Asia Aviation said Thai AirAsia will launch flights to Cambodia and expects a recovery of Chinese tourists in the second half of 2019.

The baht  is Asia's best performing currency, gaining around 5.5% against the dollar this year, helped by Thailand's $17 billion current account surplus.

The stream of investors seeking refuge in the safest parts of the market has triggered yet another recession warning, with yield curves inverting from the U.S. to the U.K.
The gap between two- and 10-year yields dropped below zero on both sides of the Atlantic after a wave of soft economic data globally. Weaker-than-forecast Chinese retail sales and industrial output set the mood for the markets, with data later in the day showing Germany’s economy contracted, adding to the gloom.
“The bond market is saying central banks are behind the curve,” said Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services in London. “It’s all doom and gloom on the global economy.”
Global Slowdown
Investors have been driving into areas of the bond market that still offer a positive yield, typically longer-dated assets that offer better returns, in order to protect their funds from a global slowdown in growth. It’s an ominous development because it suggests the prizing of safety over return: the curve is typically upward-sloping, as an investment over 10 years is expected to pay more to compensate for the longer-term risk.
U.S. 10-year yields dropped eight basis points to 1.62%, while those on two-year Treasuries fell three basis points to 1.63%. Thirty-year yields fell to a record low. In the U.K., 10-year yields dropped two basis points to 0.475%, while those on two-year bonds rose one basis point to 0.478% even as inflation jumped above the Bank of England’s 2% target.
This move has been a long time coming, and reflects a significant escalation of growth concerns. The two-to-10-year curve has been on a gradual flattening trend for more than two years on rising doubts about the health of the global economy and weak inflation. Another widely watched recession indicator, the yield difference between three-month and 10-year Treasuries, inverted in March and has been negative much of the time since.
“Where the U.S. leads, the U.K. follows,” said Adam Dent, U.K. rates strategist at  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) SA. “The market has previously been very reluctant to abandon the idea that rates will eventually normalize.”
The curve isn’t the only thing flashing high alert. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s index showing the probability of a U.S. recession over the next 12 months is close to its highest level since the global financial crisis, at around 31%."

261,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 06:04AM ET</span>","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of Low Rates for European Banks","(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s bankers greeted the news with a collective groan: The negative interest rates that had eaten into incomes for the last half a decade are set to continue and even worsen in the years ahead.
Pointing to yet another period of ragged earnings, executives called for special breaks from the European Central Bank to soften the blow of further rate cuts and other measures to stimulate economies across the eurozone. But some ECB officials have pushed back, saying interest rates aren’t the main culprit for feeble bank profitability and lenders actually benefited from the resulting economic growth.
In some ways they both have a point: Here are three charts that show how European banks win and lose from low rates.
The good news: lower rates on loans make repayments more manageable for borrowers, meaning they default less and banks can reduce the amount of money they set aside to cover soured debt. Unfortunately for Europe’s banks, loan-loss provisions have started to creep up on the whole this year. While banks say this is due to their historically low levels and specific problems with certain corporate clients, it could be a sign of worse times to come as international trade disputes weigh on European economies.
Banks have responded to the low rates by reducing their dependence on income from lending. The catch is that the alternative, earnings from commissions and trading, is volatile and tends to drop off when clients are spooked by turbulent markets. Their other main response, to cut staff costs and other expenditures, hasn’t borne much fruit so far in terms of profitability.
Banks are also increasing the volume of loans to make up for the loss of revenue from low rates. That’s one of the side effects the ECB was hoping for, but this is where it gets ugly for banks. A larger volume of lower-yielding business often means lower returns for shareholders. That amounts to banks buying market share in lending to the detriment of their margins, said Michael Huenseler, who counts bank bonds among the 24 billion euros ($26.8 billion) he helps manage at Assenagon Asset Management. “The decline might not be alarming at first, but this is a continual deterioration,” he said from Munich."
262,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 05:31AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Grim Data Bring a Quick End to Relief Rally,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Well that didn’t last long.
Europe’s stock markets went into reverse on Wednesday, as economic news in various shades of awfulness from China and Germany quickly dispelled any optimism caused on Tuesday by the U.S.’s partial retreat on new tariffs for imports out of China.
Germany’s economy shrunk by 0.1% in the second quarter, according to preliminary data released earlier that confirmed a trend already apparent in a series of grim readings from business surveys and the industrial sector. Eurostat subsequently confirmed that eurozone growth halved in the second quarter to only 0.2%.
The German figures, marked by particular weakness in the export sector, only underlined the breadth of suffering caused by China’s economic slowdown, more evidence of which came overnight with another slowdown in retail sales growth and the weakest rate of industrial production growth since 2002.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.5% at 370.54, while the German Dax was down 0.8% and Italian FTSE MIB down 1.3%. The FTSE 100 was down 0.3% after consumer inflation rose to 2.1% in July, denting the chances of a pre-emptive interest rate cut from the Bank of England ahead of the U.K.’s departure from the EU, scheduled for the end of October.
The losses were led by steelmakers ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) and Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG), both of whom face further price pressure if Chinese overproduction results in an even greater flood of cheap exports to world markets. They both fell by over 3.5%.
Banks also fared badly amid the steady rise of recession risks in Europe, which would start a new cycle of non-performing loans after six years in which they have been steadily whittled away. Germany’s Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) shares fell 3% to an all-time low, dipping below 5 euros. Unicredit (MI:CRDI) also fell 3% while   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn), which had been in talks to merge with Commerzbank earlier this year, fell 2.6%.
China-sensitive stocks were also badly hit, with the continent’s carmakers all falling over 1% and suppliers such as   Valeo   (PA:VLOF) and Schaeffler (DE:SHA_p) falling by over 2%. Luxury goods names also suffered, with Swiss groups   Richemont   (SIX:CFR) and Swatch (SIX:UHR) falling furthest as a further rise in the Swiss franc hit the value of their foreign earnings."
263,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 05:28AM ET</span>","StanChart eyes $100 billion private bank assets in growth push, to hire bankers","By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) is targeting growing its private banking assets by 50% to about $100 billion in three to five years and will hire dozens of bankers in Hong Kong and Singapore toward that goal, a senior executive of the lender said.
The moves show StanChart has big growth ambitions for the private banking unit that had until recently weighed on the lender's earnings, with its small size stoking speculation it would be put under review for possible divestment.
The lender will recruit 30-40 private bankers every year in the next two to three years to add to its roughly 300 existing relationship managers, and the bulk of the additions will be in Hong Kong and Singapore, StanChart's global head for private banking and wealth management Didier von Daeniken told Reuters.
With $65 billion worth of private banking assets, London-headquartered StanChart is a small player compared with UBS (S:UBSG) which, as per Asian Private Banker data, had assets worth $2.3 trillion and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), with $770 billion last year.
The private banking business accounted for just 3.8% of StanChart's total profit before tax in the first-half of this year.
""Our ambition is to see us cross the $100 billion mark. That makes us meaningful internally for the group, that makes us a meaningful player in this landscape,"" Daeniken said. ""Hitting $100 billion can give us credibility internally, help us to attract talent.""
StanChart's private banking business caters to wealthy individuals across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe, through booking centers in Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai, India, London and Jersey island.
The unit had weighed on the group's earnings in the recent past, as it sought to reposition the business to target rich individuals with at least $5 million in investable assets amid stiff competition in Asia, which brings in bulk of its revenue.
Underscoring a potential turnaround, StanChart's private banking business posted a pre-tax profit of $100 million in the first half of this year, compared with a loss of $5 million in the same period last year.
StanChart's private banking return on tangible equity (RoTE), a key measure of profitability, increased to 15.7% in the first half of the year compared to a negative 1% in the year-ago period, its latest financial report showed.
As part of the plans to bolster assets under management, the private banking unit plans to tap more of the group's corporate and institutional banking clients in Asia and other emerging markets where it has existing banking networks.
""With $65 billion we are definitely not among the largest, but we are part...of a company with a large balance sheet, with an unmatched presence locally in all the markets, which really matters when you cover the emerging markets,"" Daeniken said.
In the near-term, however, concerns about the global economy and 10 weeks of protests in Hong Kong that have plunged the Asian financial hub into its worst crisis had made clients ""more prudent"" in their investment decisions, he said.
Daeniken said StanChart's private banking unit had come a long way ""but the task before us is as difficult because we really have to maintain the momentum in a difficult market environment.""

(Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday, as a shrinking German economy and weak industrial data from China stoked fears of a global slowdown, forcing investors to turn defensive and overshadowing a temporary U.S.-China tariff truce.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.2% by 0820 GMT, with banks (SX7P) weighing on the benchmark, while the defensive healthcare (SXDP), utilities (SX6P) and telecom (SXKP) sectors outperformed.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration delayed imposing a 10% tariff on certain Chinese products, including laptops and cell phones, beyond September on Tuesday, providing battered equity markets world-wide some relief.
However, weak industrial data from China and a contraction for export-reliant German economy in the second quarter was a reminder that the impact of the drawn out trade war between the United States and China is far from over.
""The German GDP numbers kicked off the day badly for European markets, outweighing the limited positive impact from the Trump tariff relief,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group in London.
The Frankfurt-dominated auto index (SXAP) fell more than 1%, while borrowing costs in Germany fell to fresh record lows following the GDP data, reinforcing expectations for monetary policy stimulus soon.
Market participants are now keeping watch for a read-out of second quarter GDP numbers in the eurozone due later in the day.
Stalled growth across Europe has been led by a slowdown in the eurozone's largest economy, Germany, while the fallout from Washington's trade war with China, Brexit uncertainty, and Italy's political woes have also plagued the trading bloc.
""If Germany sneezes the rest of us catch a cold, so this is a particularly depressing outlook for the euro zone and reinforces the view that outside the U.S. things aren't going well."" said Beauchamp.
In corporate news, shares of Swiss elevator and escalator manufacturer Schindler (S:SCHP) fell 4.3% after it reported a 22% drop in second-quarter profit, dented by wage inflation, higher material costs, foreign exchange, and planned higher costs.
 Balfour Beatty  Plc (L:BALF) shares jumped 9% after the British infrastructure company reported higher first-half underlying pretax profit and increased its annual cash forecast."

267,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 03:33AM ET</span>",Stocks - Huge Wall Street Rally Greets Tariff Delay,"Investing.com - A Trump Administration decision to delay the imposition of tariffs on goods imported from China set off a huge rally Tuesday that reclaimed most of Monday's losses.
The Administration delayed the imposition of tariffs on some goods until Dec. 15, which should give retailers plenty of time to stock their shelves.
""We're doing this for the Christmas season,"" President Donald Trump told reporters
The rally sent the S&P 500 up 1.48%, the Dow Jones industrials up 1.44% and the Nasdaq Composite up nearly 2%.
The gains for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq -- 42.57 points and 153 points, respectively -- recovered all of Monday's losses. The Dow, which gained about 373 points, ended the day about 7.5 points short of a total recovery from its 380-point loss on Monday.
The Nasdaq 100 index, which has a concentration in big tech, jumped more than 2.2%. The index more than recovered its Monday loss, ending the day 82 points ahead of Friday's close.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), electronics retailer   Best Buy   (NYSE:BBY),   Nike   (NYSE:NKE), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) were among the biggest winners from the decision.
Apple rose 4.2% and contributed nearly 58 points to the Dow by itself. It was also the sixth-best performer among Nasdaq 100 stocks. 
The tariff delays were concentrated on a wide variety of goods that are big sellers in the holiday shopping season, including cell phones, tennis racquets, video game consoles, computer keyboards, footware and clothing.
The White House had vowed to impose the tariffs on Sept. 1, but the announcement in late July unnerved markets, unleashing wild swings in U.S. stock prices. Tariffs will be imposed Sept. 1, on a number of products, including food products.
The Dow was up nearly 530 points before some traders sold to lock in profits. Twenty-seven of the 30 Dow stocks were higher. Two of the decliners -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) and   IBM   (NYSE:IBM) -- were off very slightly.
Worries that China was about to send troops into Hong Kong to quell local protests appeared to have a modest effect on the markets, but analysts said markets would react unfavorably to such news.
Crude oil prices were higher as the rally took off. West Texas Intermediate crude rose $2.17 to $57.10 a barrel. Brent crude rose $2.73 to $61.30 a barrel.
Gold, however, fell back, with the December futures contract settling at $1,512.30 an ounce, off $5.
But there remained worries about global growth as the trade fight between Washington and Beijing grinds on. Investors could see it in the narrowing spread between 2-year Treasury securities and the 10-year note. Many analysts believe a 10-year that's less than a 2-year yield (inversion) is a strong signal that a recession is coming.
The 10-Year Treasury yield closed at 1.702%, after falling to as low as 1.618%. The 2-Year Treasury yield rose to 1.673%, bring the spread to just 2.9 basis points, or 2.9 one-hundredths of a percentage point. 
Technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks, communications services shares (which include Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)), were among the strongest sectors. Realvestate and utility stocks were basically flat.
Department store giant Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Briggs & Stratton (NYSE:BGG) are among companies reporting quarterly results on Wednesday.
Winners and Losers in the S&P 500
Cyber-security company Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) were among the top S&P 500 performers on Tuesday.
Utility giant Southern Company (NYSE:SO), oil-and-gas producer Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), oil-services company Helmerich and Payne (NYSE:HP) and apartment developer United Dominion Realty Trust (NYSE:UDR) were among the weakest S&P 500 performers."

TOKYO (Reuters) - China's troubled Anbang Insurance Group has put its $2.4 billion property portfolio in Japan up for sale and previous owner Blackstone Group (N:BX) is bidding, two people familiar with the company's plans said.
The insurer is offering its entire portfolio of mainly residential buildings in Tokyo and other big cities after it failed to sell some of the assets last year, the sources said. 
""The sale process has just started. Anbang is planning to sell the entire portfolio it bought from Blackstone,"" said one of the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the company's plans. 
Representatives for Anbang and Blackstone declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
A price has not been set as the sale is still in its early stages, they said. Anbang paid Blackstone about 260 billion yen ($2.4 billion) for the portfolio in 2017, then Japan's biggest property deal since the global financial crisis.
The Chinese government took control of Anbang in February last year, part of a campaign to reduce financial risk. Anbang's former chairman, Wu Xiaohui, was later sentenced to 18 years in prison for fraud and embezzlement.
Since then Beijing has accelerated asset disposals at the insurance group, which was among the most aggressive Chinese buyers of foreign assets.
Anbang tried to sell a portion of the Japanese portfolio last year, but failed to attract buyers because the assets were less attractive due to age and location, the sources said. 
They said Blackstone was among the bidders for the entire portfolio largely made up of apartment buildings catering to middle class clients in Tokyo, Nagoya and other large cities. 

Residential assets are attractive to Blackstone because they generate stable cash flow regardless of the economic cycle, unlike commercial office buildings, the sources said.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 01:18AM ET</span>","Lower fees, snazzy branches: Hong Kong banks gird for online-only onslaught","By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's biggest banks are set to cut fees, boost digital services and jazz up branches with features such as touch-screen display panels to meet competition from new online-only lenders in one of the world's most profitable banking markets.
As many as eight so-called virtual, or online-only, banks are set to be launched in the Chinese territory this year, posing the biggest challenge in years to a stronghold for lenders including HSBC and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN).
The expected moves show how keen traditional banks are to protect their cash cows even with a short-term hit to their profits, at a time when their growth elsewhere faces hurdles due to an intensifying U.S.-China trade war.
And though the virtual lenders are expected by analysts to make only a dent in the business of the incumbents, the big banks are unwilling to take any chances, given that the new breed are backed by some of China's biggest firms, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding and Ping An.
In an acknowledgement of the looming competition, HSBC said in June it would waive fees on accounts without a certain minimum balance. The British bank said the move was to promote financial inclusion. StanChart, Hong Kong-based Bank of East Asia and others followed with similar moves.
The old guard is also expected to vie to raise deposit rates, further pressuring their profits, people with knowledge of the matter said.
""The moves will certainly have an impact on the bottom line, but hopefully it will not be very significant and we would be able to offset that by increasing the business volume over a period of time,"" said a senior banker at a foreign bank.
BRICKS VERSUS CLICKS 
Hong Kong is a highly profitable banking market. Return on equity for leading Hong Kong banks ranges from 6.5% to 15%, versus 1.1-13.4% in Asia, 0.4-9.2% in Europe, and 8.6%-15.8% in the United States, as per Refinitiv data.
HSBC made $3.4 billion in pre-tax profits from its Hong Kong retail banking and wealth management operations in the first half of this year, accounting for more than a quarter of the bank's entire profits for the period.
The bank, which has about a 30% share of retail deposits in Hong Kong, has been bolstering its own digital capabilities, its Asia Pacific head of retail banking and wealth management, Kevin Martin, said.
""We're very aware that competition is increasing and our customers' expectations are changing and we will ensure we continue to invest ... to meet these challenges and needs.""
StanChart's $1.9 billion first-half operating income in Hong Kong represented a quarter of its total operating income. The bank is leading a consortium that has won a virtual banking license.
""As competition increases, there will be some pressures on fees and charges, which will be good for customers,"" said Samir Subberwal, StanChart's regional head of retail banking in Greater China and North Asia. 
""But we believe that banks, as well as the new virtual banks, will be sensible in pricing and discipline on financial management,"" he said.
Bank of East Asia declined to comment. The people declined to be identified as they were not allowed to discuss specific plans.
The new online-only banks include those set up by consortia led by affiliates of e-commerce and payments powerhouse Alibaba, insurer PingAn, and smartphone maker Xiaomi, as well as Bank of China Hong Kong. 
The digital banks plan to begin by offering services such as savings accounts, credit cards, personal loans, foreign exchange and travel insurance. They also promise account openings in just four minutes, an eye-catching claim in a city where customer complaints about account opening difficulties are common.
The key threat, however, is that their lower overheads will enable them to offer sharply lower or zero-fee services, said the sources.
Hong Kong banks earn huge fees levied on retail banking services.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates the total fee pool was $9 billion in 2018, broadly flat over the last five years. 
MAKING MONEY 
Banks including HSBC and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are also looking to shift more customers to digital platforms and have been revamping the physical branches to make service delivery efficient and interactive.
Citi, for example, plans to soon launch a ""digital only"" banking option for its retail customers, said its Hong Kong CEO Angel Ng, to supplement its physical network. ""The branches are also more akin to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stores and are paper-less and hi-tech.""
The virtual banks are, however, unlikely to grab a sizeable share from the traditional banks soon, analysts said. New tech-based players that entered Europe's banking and payments sector since 2005 had 6%-7% of the market in 2016, a study by consultancy Accenture (NYSE:ACN) showed.
""The incumbents will have to respond to it (aggressive fee pricing), but virtual banks still have to make money,"" said Tim Pagett, Asia Pacific financial services leader for consultancy Deloitte. 

""While they don't have to carry the cost of physical branch networks, they do actually have to carry cost and they do have shareholders who have certain return expectations.""

Glencore had argued that information revealed by the Paradise Papers - a leaked dossier that included information on clients of the Appleby law firm in Bermuda - should not be available to tax authorities as the information had been stolen.
But Australia's high court found that the Australian Tax Office (ATO) was entitled to access the documents as they were in the public domain, adding that lawyer-client privilege did not apply in this case.
The decision means the ATO can continue to use the Paradise Papers and other similar data leaks, ATO Second Commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn said in a statement.
""Today's decision is not just a win for the ATO; it's a win for the Australian community who rightly expect the ATO to use all information available to ensure large corporations ... are paying the right amount of tax,"" he said.
The ruling potentially opens the door for Glencore to receive a backdated tax bill, given the ATO has handed peers BHP (AX:BHP) (L:BHPB) and  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO) (AX:RIO) large tax notices in recent years after reviewing their tax practices, specifically those around valuing commodities in lower tax jurisdictions.
""Glencore respects today's High Court decision,"" a company spokesman told Reuters. "

276,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 11:47PM ET</span>",Tech Suppliers Shift Away From China Despite Trump Tariff Delay,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ).-laptop maker Inventec Corp. said it will to shift production of notebooks for the U.S. market out of China within months, adding to the tech industry’s exodus as the world’s two largest economies escalate their trade war.
Inventec plans to move its entire American-bound laptop operation to its home base of Taiwan within two to three months, President Maurice Wu said on a post-earnings call Tuesday. Wu’s company assembles Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s AirPods and produces notebook computers for HP, which accounts for an estimated third of its revenue.
Underscoring the difficulty of making such long-term production decisions, President Donald Trump said just hours later that the U.S. would push back implementation of tariffs on Chinese-made laptop and other products to December from September. But tech companies aren’t waiting for a trade resolution. From Inventec to Apple-assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Taiwanese companies that make most of the world’s electronics are reconsidering their reliance on the world’s No. 2 economy as Washington-Beijing tensions simmer.
“The trade war is very painful for us,” Wu said, concluding a call during which executives shared how production shifts have hurt the company’s efficiency and margins.
Rising tariffs on Chinese-made products threaten to wipe out their margins and up-end a well-oiled, decades-old supply chain.  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Sony Corp (T:6758). and Nintendo Co (T:7974). are said to be among those now weighing their options away from the line of fire, such as Southeast Asia and India. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google has already shifted much of its production of U.S.-bound motherboards to Taiwan, Bloomberg News has reported.
Inventec’s shift marks one of the most dramatic relocations since Trump announced his decision to slap 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports -- including consumer gadgets from smartphones to notebooks -- originally slated for next month. Spurred on by clients, which include household names like Dell Technologies Inc. and Nintendo, many Taiwanese contract manufacturers are now drawing up contingency plans, shifting select assembly operations or exploring alternative venues.
Analysts anticipate the tariff delay will have little impact on those plans.
“While this announcement appears to provide incremental (and market-friendly) information as to how the White House is approaching trade policy, we do not believe it represents a substantial shift in the U.S.-China dispute,” Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts wrote in response. “Our broader expectation is that the U.S. and China are unlikely to reach a lasting agreement prior to the 2020 election that provides certainty around tariff rates on imports from China.”
On Tuesday, Compal Electronics Inc. Chief Executive Officer Martin Wong said his company, a rival to Inventec, has also shifted some notebook lines to Taiwan and was considering investing more in Vietnam should tariff-conflicts persist. Quanta Computer Inc. Chairman Barry Lam told reporters Tuesday his company is definitely re-locating some business to Southeast Asia, though he didn’t mention a timeframe. Chief Financial Officer Elton Yang said Quanta will for now aim to satisfy customers’ demands for production outside of China with their Taiwan facilities.
U.S. companies, long accustomed to using China as the world’s workshop, are looking to diversify their manufacturing operations as the uncertainty over volatile trade policy heightens and Beijing shows a willingness to clamp down on foreign firms within its own borders. It’s a shift that may herald a broader, long-term trend as Beijing and Washington continue to spar over everything from market access to trade.
The trade war threatens to disrupt a complex global supply chain involving many countries beyond just China and the U.S. Many components that go into devices aren’t made in the U.S., despite being designed there. A phone chip designed by Apple may come out of a factory in Taiwan, then be packaged (a process that prepares it for integration into a circuit) somewhere else, before being shipped to China for assembly into an iPhone.
Still, few major manufacturers have moved output in truly significant amounts and China’s status as the world’s production base for electronics is unlikely to diminish anytime soon. Foxconn Technology Group has said it has enough capacity to make all iPhones bound for the U.S. outside of China if necessary, although Apple has so far not asked for such a shift.

277,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 11:46PM ET</span>",China Stocks Rise on Tariff Delay After Yuan Surges Past 7,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks gained after the U.S. delayed the imposition of new tariffs on some consumer products including toys and laptops until December.
The Shanghai Composite Index was 1% higher in premarket trading Wednesday. The Hang Seng Index rose 1.7% even after protests at Hong Kong’s airport turned violent and prompted flight cancellations for a second day. The offshore yuan weakened 0.2% after jumping the most on record overnight to briefly trade stronger than 7 per dollar.
While many Chinese imports remain on the list to be hit on Sept. 1, President Donald Trump’s move on Tuesday to delay the imposition of new tariffs on some products will bring some relief to markets. When he threatened the duties earlier this month, Chinese shares reacted with a 1.5% rout, while the yuan tumbled and broke beyond the key 7-per-dollar level days later for the first time in more than a decade.
“This will spur only a short-term bounce in risk appetite, and more evidently in Hong Kong than on the mainland,” said Liang Jinxin, an analyst at Tianfeng Securities. “Everyone knows that trade friction is not going to go away overnight.”
Investors are cautious as a resolution to the trade dispute remains uncertain, while protracted tit-for-tat negotiations threaten to derail global growth and ignite a currency war. Political unrest in Hong Kong is showing no signs of easing after weeks of protests that have become more violent. Trump warned in a tweet of Chinese troops massing on the border."
278,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 11:44PM ET</span>",Japan Stock Traders Look Past Bad Earnings to Bet on Turnaround,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s equity investors are looking beyond the most disappointing earnings in three years, betting on a turnaround in the market on the view that valuations are cheap and the Bank of Japan will step up easing.
Some 60% of the 1,572 companies that reported first fiscal quarter earnings as of Aug. 6 are behind schedule, achieving less than 25% their annual net profit targets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysis from Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) shows that the proportion of the firms beating earnings expectations dropped to the lowest in fiscal 2017.
Still, stock bulls are quick to point out that shares are getting cheap now that the Topix has erased its year-to-date gain. Japan’s benchmark has been one of the worst-performers among the 24 developed markets tracked by Bloomberg for months. Its forward P/E ratio dropped to around 12 times, compared with a five-year average of 13.4 times.
“It’s definitely worth dipping in,” Mikio Kumada, a Hong Kong based global strategist at LGT Capital Partners, said in a phone interview. “I do expect Japan to be performing -- maybe not outperforming globally in the second half -- but certainly catching up with the other markets.”
According to Kumada, the equity market in Japan shouldn’t be falling so far behind the U.S. and China, given that monetary policies are accomodative at home and abroad. He also expects a bottoming out of China’s economy to support growth in Japan. Both the S&P 500 Index and Shanghai Composite Index are up more than 10% this year.
For those investors worried about the yen’s strength, Daiwa Securities Co. says don’t fret too much. The currency’s surge to a seven-month high against the dollar isn’t drastic enough to alter the outlook for profit growth for the second half of this fiscal year, according to the firm. The yen is at about 106.4 per dollar, versus the rate of 108 forecast in many companies’ annual results.
Daiwa Securities estimates that companies on the first-section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange are likely to report an average growth of 12.5% in ordinary profit in the second half. While that is lower than its previous estimates, it would be a turnaround from profit declines expected for the first half ending September. The forecasts exclude figures for SoftBank Group Corp. and Tokyo Electric Power Co.
“We’re looking at a turnaround in earnings in the second half of this fiscal year,” said Hideyuki Ishiguro, a senior strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. “The recovery scenario is intact.”
Not everyone is that optimistic. Mitsushige Akino, the executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co., said the market lacks confidence to boost stock prices. The leading coincident index, a key economic measure, fell in June to a level unseen since the wake of the financial crisis, fueling concern about the economy before an October sales-tax hike.
Some bulls like LGT’s Kumada are betting the BOJ will come to the equity market’s rescue. The central bank said last month it’s “more positive” about adding monetary stimulus as it eyes a global shift toward interest rate cuts. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda kept policy unchanged in July, while trimming inflation forecasts.

“As bottom-up investors, we are looking for opportunities to buy stocks at prices which do not factor in future earnings growth,” said Tony Glover, a senior investment specialist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management Japan based in Tokyo. “We’d like to think that at times like this where the market is being sold off, the chances of being able to do so increase.”

280,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 09:46PM ET</span>",Exclusive: European online job search websites call on EU to crack down on Google,"By Foo Yun Chee and Paresh Dave
BRUSSELS/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google's fast-growing tool for searching job listings has been a boon for employers and job boards starving for candidates, but several rival job-finding services contend anti-competitive behavior has fueled its rise and cost them users and profits. 
In a letter to be sent to European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday and seen by Reuters, 23 job search websites in Europe called on her to temporarily order Google to stop playing unfairly while she investigates.
Similar to worldwide leader Indeed and other search services familiar to job seekers, Google's tool links to postings aggregated from many employers. It lets candidates filter, save and get alerts about openings, though they must go elsewhere to apply.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google places a large widget for the 2-year-old tool at the top of results for searches such as ""call center jobs"" in most of the world. 
Some rivals allege that positioning is illegal because Google is using its dominance to attract users to its specialized search offering without the traditional marketing investments they have to make. 
Other job technology firms say Google has restored industry innovation and competition.
The tensions expose a new front in the battle between Google and online publishers reliant on search traffic, just as EU and U.S. antitrust regulators heed calls to scrutinize tech giants including Google. Google so far over the last decade has withstood similar accusations from companies in local business and travel search.
Vestager, who has been examining job search on Google, leaves office Oct. 31. But a person familiar with the review told Reuters that Vestager is preparing an ""intensive"" handover so that her successor does not drop it. Her office declined to comment on the handoff.
Lack of action could spur Tuesday's signatories, which include British site Best Jobs Online to German peers Intermedia and Jobindex, to follow with formal complaints against Google to Vestager, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Berlin-based StepStone GmbH, which operates 30 job websites globally, and another German search service already have taken that step, another person said. 
The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, which are examining online competition in the United States, declined to comment on whether they are probing Google's jobs search.
Industry executives universally expect that Google will sell ads in the jobs tool, as is typical for its services, enabling the world's biggest seller of online ads to claw billions of dollars in revenue from rivals.
Google long has been frustrated by other search engines filling its results, because they both add a step in users' quest for quick information and pose a threat to its ads empire. 
Nick Zakrasek, senior product manager for Google search, said that the company welcomed the industry feedback on jobs search. Google said its offering addresses previous antitrust complaints by allowing rival search services to participate and includes a feature in Europe designed to give rivals prominence.
""Any provider - from individual employers to job listing platforms - can utilize this feature in search, and many of them have seen a significant increase in the number of job applications they receive,"" Zakrasek said in a statement. ""By improving the search experience for jobs, we're able to deliver more traffic to sites across the web and support a healthy job search ecosystem.""
DIVISIVE TOOL
Google includes jobs only from websites that follow its guidelines, which require postings to be structured such that its computers can easily interpret them. Many leading players have conformed.
For instance, Weston, Massachusetts-based Monster Worldwide Inc has implored customers through training materials to list salary ranges and jobsite addresses on postings in hopes that following Google's guidelines for such items will generate more clicks.
Monster had lost users in recent years because poor website formatting left it with low placement in regular Google results, its Chief Executive Scott Gutz said. The new tool gave Monster a path back to the top.
""There's been a leveling of the playing field,"" Gutz said.
Google's widget drew 120 million user clicks in June in the United States alone, about double from August 2017, according to research firm Jumpshot, which receives browsing data from antivirus apps.
Holmdel, New Jersey-based iCIMS Inc, which operates job websites for about 4,000 employers, said Google's tool is the third largest referrer of visitors to clients' pages and applicants from it are three times more likely to be hired than those from rival tools, it said. 
""What we're already seeing with Google's entrance is better matching candidates to jobs,"" said Susan Vitale, chief marketing officer for iCIMS.
Frustrated are competitors such as Zippia, a San Mateo, California jobs search startup specializing in career path data. CEO Henry Shao said Google's jobs tool ""pushes down"" Zippia content in search results, making it more difficult to attract users unless it invests in following Google's guidelines. 
Zippia lacks the resources to pursue formal complaints, but would aid investigators that call, Shao said.
Larger detractors include StepStone, a unit of media company and long-time Google critic Axel Springer which eschewed Google's guidelines on most of its jobs websites. Among concerns is that participants are handing over data that could help Google bypass them entirely.
The 23 firms pressing Vestager echoed that worry and said that Google including generic links to competing services high on its European jobs widget was not enough to ensure ""equal treatment.""
Austin, Texas-based Indeed, which has not formatted its website to participate in Google's tool, declined to comment.
Indeed's traffic from Google has dipped 5% since 2016, according to Jumpshot. It compensated by boosting advertising and pushing new paid offerings, affecting earnings growth, former employees said. 
Owner Recruit Holdings Co Ltd forecasts that sales from its Indeed-dominated segment will grow 35% in the year ending March 31, 2020, compared to 50% the year earlier, while adjusted profit margin will be flat.

Eric Liaw, a general partner invested in workplace tech startups at Silicon Valley's Institutional Venture Partners, said Google has ""to be careful about how much air they suck out of the room given the scrutiny they are under.""

281,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 09:32PM ET</span>",Your Money: Big companies explore virtual care to curb healthcare costs,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big companies are increasing incorporating virtual technology and care options into employee benefit plans to combat the rising healthcare costs that long been corporate America's bugaboo, according to the annual survey of the National Business Group on Health.
The No. 1 goal for employers in 2020 is to implement more virtual care provisions. This includes things like behavioral health over video chat, digital coaching, condition management and sleep therapies, according to the NBGH, a research group that represents large employers.
""Virtual solutions are scalable. They improve convenience and access,"" said Brian Marcotte, president and chief executive of NBGH. 
Overall, healthcare costs are projected to rise 5% for 2020, the survey said. In past years, especially during the 2008 recession, that number had been about double, Marcotte said.
Actual costs may be rising at a slower pace than that 5% forecast indicates, since employers typically add in a cushion, said Marcotte. For instance, cost inflation for 2018 turned out to be just 3.6% for 2018, while the projection was 6%. 
Even as the price of care, especially drugs, has increased, costs have been held in check because usage of healthcare benefits has not gone up - largely achieved by raising policyholders' deductibles.
Virtual care programs reduce use of emergency services by getting front-line care to people without access, like rural communities, and to people like shift workers, or post-partum moms, who have trouble making in-person appointments. 
""It's not about too much money being spent, but that too many people have needs that are not being met by outpatient services,"" said Jeff Levin-Scherz, health management practice co-leader at Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW), a benefits consultant. 
A separate survey Willis Towers Watson found that 81 percent of employers currently offer or plan to offer tele-behavioral health services by 2020. 
MORE CHOICE
Another trend for 2020: Large companies that shifted to only high-deductible offerings are starting to add back choice options.
In 2018, forty percent of large companies offered only high-deductible plan options. In 2019, that dropped to 30%, and NBGH forecasts it will fall to 25% in 2020. 
Marcotte attributes the reversal to companies no longer worried about the effect of the so-called ""Cadillac Tax,"" which would have imposed fees on the most generous benefit plans. 

Low unemployment is also a driving factor, given that companies now have to compete to retain workers.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 09:11PM ET</span>",Explainer: Countdown to recession - What an inverted yield curve means,"By Richard Leong, Dan Burns and Karen Brettell
The spread between yields on U.S. two-year and 10-year notes, a closely watched metric, is likely to invert for the first time since 2007. That would follow the inversion of another part of the yield curve earlier in the year. Here is what that means.
WHAT IS THE TREASURY YIELD CURVE?
The yield curve is a plot of the yields on all Treasury maturities - debt sold by the federal government - ranging from 1-month bills to 30-year bonds.
In normal circumstances, it has an arcing, upward slope because bond investors expect to be compensated more for taking on the added risk of owning bonds with longer maturities.
When yields further out on the curve are substantially higher than those near the front, the curve is referred to as steep. So a 30-year bond will deliver a much higher yield than a two-year note.
When the gap, or ""spread"", is narrow, it is referred to as a flat curve. In that situation, a 10-year note, for instance, may offer only a modestly higher yield than a 3-year note.
WHAT IS A CURVE INVERSION?
On rare occasions, some or all of the yield curve ceases to be upward sloping. This occurs when shorter-dated yields are higher than longer-dated ones and is called an inversion.
While various economic or market commentators may focus on different parts of the yield curve, any inversion of the yield curve tells the same story: An expectation of weaker growth in the future.
In March, inversion of the yield curve hit 3-month T-bills for the first time in about 12 years when the yield on 10-year notes dropped below those for 3-month securities. That metric reverted back and then inverted again in May and is now trading at negative 36 basis points.
On Tuesday the curve between two-year and 10-year notes compressed to 1-1/2 basis points, the flattest since 2007.
The curve overall has been flattening for some time. The front-end to intermediate part of the curve inverted for the first time in a decade in December.
WHY DOES INVERSION MATTER?
Yield curve inversion is a classic signal of a looming recession.
For a graphic on bonds, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2YN5XYj
The U.S. curve has inverted before each recession in the past 50 years. It offered a false signal just once in that time.
When short-term yields climb above longer-dated ones, it signals short-term borrowing costs are more expensive than longer-term loan costs.
Under these circumstances, companies often find it more expensive to fund their operations, and executives tend to temper or shelve investments. Consumer borrowing costs also rise and consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slows.
The economy eventually contracts and unemployment rises.
WHY IS THE TWO-YEAR, 10-YEAR CURVE IMPORTANT?
The two-year Treasury, which is the shortest dated Treasury note, is highly sensitive to rate moves. The yield spread between this maturity and the benchmark 10-year note has traditionally been a popular focus for market participants, many of whom may not trade shorter-dated Treasury bills. It has been a solid indicator that a recession is likely one-to-two years later.
That said, the yield curve between three-month bills and 10-year notes has become an increasingly popular indicator of future weakness since the Federal Reserve identified it as a more accurate recession indicator than other parts of the curve.
An economic paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco last year found that this part of the yield curve has better accuracy as a predictor of a recession 12 months into the future.
For a graphic on bonds, bills, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2MXddts
The curve's inversion often ends before a recession begins.
A yield curve inversion does not predict the length nor severity of a downturn.
WHY DOES THE CURVE INVERT AT ALL?
Shorter-dated securities are highly sensitive to interest rate policy set by a central bank such as the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Longer-dated securities are more influenced by investors' expectations for future inflation because inflation is anathema to bond holders.
So, when the Fed is raising rates, as it did for three years, that pushes up yields on shorter-dated bonds at the front of the curve. And when future inflation is seen as contained, as it is now because higher borrowing costs are expected to become a drag on the economy, investors are willing to accept relatively modest yields on long-dated bonds at the back end of the curve.
The two-year, 10-year yield curve initially steepened after the Fed in March stunned markets by abruptly abandoning its three-year drive to tighten monetary policy.
The U.S. central bank cut rates in July for the first time since 2008.
The curve resumed flattening in July, however, as concerns increased that weak international growth would spread to the U.S. economy and as the U.S.-China trade war weighed on business sentiment.
Increasingly, investors are concerned that more dovish central bank policies globally will not be enough to stimulate international growth."
283,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 08:56PM ET</span>",Trump promises more big energy projects at Pennsylvania plant,"By Jeff Mason and Timothy Gardner
MONACA, Pa./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump told workers on Tuesday at a $6 billion petrochemicals plant being built in western Pennsylvania that more big U.S. energy projects were coming as his administration rolls back environmental regulations. 
""This is just the beginning,"" Trump told workers wearing hard hats at Shell's (L:RDSa) ethylene cracker plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. ""My administration is clearing the way for other massive, multibillion-dollar investments."" 
He praised the Shell plant as part of ""the revolution in American energy that's helping make our economy the envy of the world"" and said the project would have never happened without him, although its final permits were issued before he was elected in 2016. 
Trump won Pennsylvania in that election by less than 1 percentage point, and he has visited the state often ahead of the 2020 vote.
The Trump administration is pursuing a policy of ""energy dominance"" that seeks to maximize oil, gas and coal production in part by slashing regulations. 
Last week, its Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, unveiled a proposal that would limit the power of states to block pipelines and other energy projects, months after Trump ordered the agency to change a section of the U.S. Clean Water Act that states including New York and Washington have used to delay the building of pipelines and terminals. 
At the Shell plant, Trump apparently tried to take credit for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, called Cameron LNG, he visited in May. Full approvals for that plant were made before Trump was elected. ""We just did one in Louisiana, it's a $10 billion plant,"" Trump said.
U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who accompanied Trump to the Shell plant, has embraced an up-to $10 billion Appalachian Storage and Trading Hub project to hold liquids from natural gas production. The project could help support the building of more petrochemical plants in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where a natural gas boom is at risk from falling prices.
Regional officials hope to secure a $1.9 billion federal loan guarantee being considered by the Energy Department for the hub. But critics say that U.S. taxpayers would be on the hook if the project fails.
And environmentalists worried about plastic garbage ending up in the world's oceans slammed the hub. 
The project would ""expose Appalachian residents to increased harm from fracking and industrial toxic emissions, while creating more plastic trash that is filling our oceans,"" said Wenonah Hauter, executive director at Food & Water Watch.

Petrochemical manufacturers say that demand for plastics, used in food storage, surgical devices, and in car parts, will increase as the global middle class expands. Shell says it supports plastics recycling and reuse.

284,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 06:13PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Cisco Earnings on Tap
Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday after markets close amid concerns that weaker enterprise spending on networking equipment may dent growth. 
Concerns about networking spending rose to the fore last week when networking giant NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) warned first-quarter revenue would fall short of estimates, blaming global uncertainty.
But analysts are backing Cisco’s diversified products and services offering to prevail. 
“Cisco's diverse networking business likely achieves an in-line FQ4 despite broader signs of wavering enterprise demand,” Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients. 
Cisco), up 21.5% for the year, is expected to report earnings of 81 cents a share on revenue of $13.39 billion. 
2. U.K. Inflation and Sterling in Focus
The United Kingdom will release its figures on inflation for July on Wednesday at 4:30 AM ET (9:30 GMT). 
Economists forecast overall inflation measured by the consumer price index in July fell 0.1%, compared with a 0.3% rise the prior month, while the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy price, is seen falling by 0.1% as well.
That would see year-over-year CPI growth fall to 1.9% from 2.0% and the core CPI growth remain unchanged at 1.8%. 
GBP/USD has come under heavy pressure against the backdrop of political uncertainty and increasing fears of Britain leaving the European Union on Oct. 31 without a trade deal, a hard Brexit.
""Deal or no-deal, a general election looks increasingly likely,"" said James Smith, economist at ING.
3. Crude Inventories in Focus as Oil Rallies
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) releases its weekly petroleum report on Wednesday amid a more positive backdrop for oil prices as United States decided to delay tariffs on some China goods, giving investors a sliver of hope that the world’s two biggest economies can put their trade feud on ice. 
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data - which often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels - showing crude stockpiles fell by 2.19 million barrels last week.
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 2.78 million barrels.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, rallied 4% to settle at $57.10 a barrel on Tuesday as U.S. stocks rallied strongly. "
285,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 05:30PM ET</span>","U.S. to delay China tariffs on some products, including laptops, cell phones","By David Shepardson and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday backed off his Sept. 1 deadline for 10% tariffs on remaining Chinese imports, delaying duties on cellphones, laptops and other consumer goods, in the hopes of blunting their impact on U.S. holiday sales.
The delay which, affects about half of the $300 billion target list of Chinese goods - along with news of renewed trade discussions between U.S. and Chinese officials - sent stocks sharply higher and drew cautious relief from retailers and technology groups. 
Trump's 10% tariffs will be effective from Dec. 15 for thousands of products including clothing and footwear, possibly buttressing the holiday selling season from some of the fallout from the protracted trade spat between the world's two largest economies. 
""We're doing this for Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on U.S. customers,"" Trump told reporters in New Jersey. ""Just in case they might have an impact on people, what we've done is we've delayed it so that they won't be relevant to the Christmas shopping season.""
The U.S. Trade Representative's Office announced the decision just minutes after China's Ministry of Commerce said Vice Premier Liu He conducted a phone call with U.S. trade officials.
Liu agreed with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to speak again by phone within the next two weeks, the ministry said.
Trump has said the two sides may still meet in early September as scheduled.
APPLE SHINES
The delay in tariffs on a substantial portion of a $300 billion list of remaining Chinese imports sent U.S. stocks surging, after steep losses in the past week, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX) up 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) gaining nearly 2%. 
Shares of market bellwether Apple Inc (O:AAPL) soared 4.2% on news that its core iPhone, tablet and laptop computer products would be spared from tariffs for the time being. (N) 
But the Trump administration still plans to impose 10% tariffs on thousands of Chinese food, clothing and other consumer electronics products beginning Sept. 1.
Among these are Chinese-made smartwatches from Apple and Fitbit (N:FIT), smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) , Google (O:GOOGL) and Apple, and Bluetooth headphones and other devices, a category estimated at $17.9 billion last year by the Consumer Technology Association.
Flat screen televisions from China, a category worth $4.5 billion, also will face 10% tariffs on Sept. 1 after being spared from Trump's first round of tariffs more than a year ago. 
Live animals, dairy products, skis, golf balls, contacts lenses, lithium ion batteries and snowblowers will also get tariffs on Sept. 1
Based on a Reuters analysis, the delay could extend to around half of the $300 billion list of remaining Chinese imports. Chinese imports subject to the tariffs on Dec. 15 totaled about $156 billion last year, according U.S. Census bureau data.
Most retailers would have stocked their holiday merchandise before the earlier September deadline, some might have faced the tariffs for fill-in orders late in the holiday shopping season.
Still, the Retail Industry Leaders Association said ""removing some products from the list and delaying additional 10% tariffs on other products, such as toys, consumer electronics, apparel and footwear, until Dec. 15 is welcome news as it will mitigate some pain for consumers through the holiday season.""
The Consumer Technology Association applauded the delay on some items, but added: ""Next month, we’ll begin to pay more for some of our favorite tech devices – including TVs, smart speakers and desktop computers. The administration should permanently remove these harmful tariffs and find another way to hold China accountable for its unfair trading practices."" 
The 21-page-list of products that will not get hit with tariffs until December also includes baby monitors and strollers, microwaves, instant print cameras, doorbells, high chairs, musical instruments, ketchup dispensers, baby diapers, fireworks, sleeping bags, nativity scenes, fishing reels, paint rollers and food products.
A separate group of products will be removed from the tariff list altogether, the USTR said, ""based on health, safety, national security and other factors."" It did not immediately identify these items.
Trump announced the Sept. 1 tariffs less than two weeks ago, blaming China for not following through on promises to buy more American agricultural products during talks in Shanghai at the end of July. That move was met with a drop in China's yuan currency a few days later, prompting the Trump administration to declare Beijing a currency manipulator and sending markets tumbling for several days last week. 
Since Trump's Aug. 1 tweets announcing the new tariffs, the U.S. benchmark S&P stock index has dropped more than 4%. 
The tariff delay, combined with renewed talks with China, suggest Trump may be willing to compromise. 
In a sign the administration may be expecting something in return, Trump tweeted on Tuesday: ""As usual, China said they were going to be buying “big” from our great American Farmers. So far they have not done what they said. Maybe this will be different!"" Trump tweeted.
Trump's tariff delay comes amid growing concerns about a global economic slowdown. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said on Sunday fears of the U.S.-China trade war leading to a recession were increasing and Goldman no longer expects a trade deal between the two countries before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
Trump has also personally criticized Chinese President Xi Jinping for failing to do more to stem sales of the synthetic opioid fentanyl amid an opioid overdosing crisis in the United States.

The USTR office plans to conduct an exclusion process that could allow more items to be removed from the 10% tariff list.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 05:26PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC to consider new guidance on investor use of proxy advisors,"By Jessica DiNapoli
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday said it would hold a meeting next week on whether to publish new guidance regarding the responsibilities of investors when relying on so-called proxy advisors.
The proposal comes amid a push by the corporate lobby to rein in proxy advisors, which recommend how investors should vote in corporate elections on issues like pay and diversity. Groups representing listed companies claim the current SEC rules have allowed special interests to hijack boardrooms with costly demands.
Shareholder proposals on charged issues like gun rights and climate change have taken on a higher profile since the 2007-2009 financial crisis as a mechanism for better corporate oversight.
The move could set the SEC up for a clash with investors, who worry the agency is siding with companies to diminish voting rights.
The SEC said in a notice published on its website that the agency will ""consider whether to publish"" the new guidance at Wednesday's meeting, but did not specify what the guidance would be.
However, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters they expected it to clarify that investors do not have to submit votes for every share they own - a misconception that has allowed proxy firms to gain significant influence, say their critics.
The guidance is also expected to outline how investors should monitor their use of proxy advisors and ensure they are actually voting the way investors designate.
Investor groups and proxy advisory firms have said they worry any new guidance could ultimately make it more difficult for proxy advisory firms to provide timely, independent and cost-effective research for investors.
A spokeswoman for the SEC declined to comment beyond Wednesday's notice."

President Nicolas Maduro's government has defaulted on most of roughly $60 billion in foreign bonds issued by Venezuela and state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., or PDVSA, but has had minimal contact with creditors about addressing the situation.
The measure follows U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order last week that froze Venezuelan government assets in the United States.
Opposition leader Juan Guaido wants to prevent creditors from taking the country's main foreign asset, U.S. refiner Citgo as partial repayment for debt.
The commission would be tasked with ""the study of debt, and of course, protection of our assets,"" Guaido told reporters. In January he invoked the constitution to assume a rival presidency, arguing Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate.
The seven-member commission will include legislators and economists, and be formally approved in upcoming congressional sessions, Guaido said.
It will carry out ""actions to design and prepare for the renegotiation of public debt, including proposals for refinancing or restructuring,"" according to a preliminary proposal.
Opposition leaders said the new U.S. sanctions will help them protect Citgo and would pave the way for the renegotiation of a bond backed by Citgo shares.
Creditors have had little contact with Venezuelan officials because Maduro is not seen as credible negotiator and because U.S. sanctions prevent many from holding such meetings.
Guaido, who has been recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's legitimate president, is preparing for a renegotiation process after Maduro leaves power. Maduro calls him a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup, and has accused the opposition of trying to ""steal"" Citgo."

The toymaker said in an email to Bloomberg that an announced delay in the levies until Dec. 15 on some products will help it mitigate the impact on U.S. consumers during the upcoming holiday season. The change will also give the company more time to update global sourcing plans.
The decision to delay some of the tariffs from Sept. 1 was an attempt to spare consumers some pain during the holiday season, President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday. Consumer goods prices have already been on the rise, and retailers unable to swallow the tariff hikes were expected to raise prices on impacted products ahead of the critical holiday period.
“We appreciate the administration listening to our concerns,” spokeswoman Julie Duffy said.
Hasbro gained 4% to $117.65 at 1:37 p.m. in New York, on pace for its biggest gain in three weeks, while fellow toymaker  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT). was up 4.9% to $11.54.
The Toy Association, an industry trade group, echoed Hasbro’s message, saying that the delay “saved the holiday season” while adding that tariffs are the wrong approach to U.S.-China trade relations.
Toy companies are especially sensitive to fluctuations in the holiday shopping season, with the bulk of their sales coming in the second half of the year.
Consumer groups are still concerned, however, since the delay kicks the can down the road and doesn’t resolve the fundamental uncertainty that companies have faced since trade tensions with China flared up.
“What we really need is an effective strategy to address China’s unfair trade practices by working with our allies instead of using unilateral tariffs that cost American jobs and hurt consumers,” David French, a spokesman for the National Retail Federation, said.

Rosario Robles, who was minister for social development and agrarian development from 2012 to 2018, is accused of participating in an embezzlement scandal that saw 5 billion pesos ($260 million) diverted from federal agencies during the presidency of Enrique Pena Nieto. She was sent to prison for two months as the investigation unfolds.
National TV networks on Tuesday morning showed video of Robles, a former head of the Mexico City government, in a black police SUV on her way to the Santa Martha prison on the eastern edge of Mexico City. The public prosecutor argued that she was a flight risk. Robles’s lawyer said she is innocent and that her detention is unnecessary and a violation of her rights.
AMLO, as the leftist leader is known, was elected a year ago partly on the back of promises to rid the nation of graft. Veronica Ortiz, a lawyer and co-host of a show on Mexico’s non-partisan Congress channel who has followed the nation’s politics for more than two decades, said she can’t recall another instance of a current or former cabinet official going to jail.
How AMLO’s Plans to Transform Mexico Ran Into Reality: QuickTake
“On the fight against corruption, this sends a signal that accusations that a judge believes have substance will be pursued,” she said.
In July prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Emilio Lozoya, the former chief executive officer of national oil producer Petroleos Mexicanos, in connection to the purchase of a fertilizer plant that was allegedly overvalued. Lozoya became a fugitive after disobeying orders to appear before a judge. They also arrested Juan Ramon Collado, an attorney with ties to Pena Nieto, on on money-laundering charges.

As the electric carmaker’s shares plunged 30% this year, the stock has become the most profitable short bet in the U.S., according to Aug. 9 data from S3 Partners. Bears have seen a whopping $2.75 billion of mark-to-market gains in 2019, according to the firm’s head of research Ihor Dusaniwsky.
It’s unlikely that short-sellers’ newfound riches were what Elon Musk was envisioning during his long-running Twitter feud with skeptics. The electric-carmaker’s chief executive officer took to social media several times to goad the ‘‘value destroyers” in better times, such as when he warned them in May 2018 to prepare for the “short burn of the century.”
While shares have bounced back a bit from their lows in early June, Tesla remains on pace for its worst annual decline on record. The downturn comes amid growing concern about demand for its vehicles and the company’s ability to turn profits.
Short-seller gains for Tesla are more than triple this year’s second-most profitable bearish bet: drugmaker  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)., which returned about $776 million. DuPont (NYSE:DD) de Nemours Inc. was third, handing bears $631 million in mark-to-market gains.
Wondering about the worst-performing shorts? Surprisingly, one of the costliest bearish bets in the market this year, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc., is not on the top 10 list. Short-sellers got a boost after a surprise secondary offering last month sent the stock plunging. Beyond Meat is trading roughly 30% below its late July peak.
Depository receipts for  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. have yielded the largest loss for bears so far, reaching nearly $3 billion. That’s followed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc., which despite the trade war tumult, have been difficult to bet against.
The S&P 500 Information Technology Index, which includes half of the names in this list, has gained 28% in 2019 so far.

The iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF, or EWH, saw its volume soar to 25 million shares on Tuesday in New York -- the most since August 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Since demonstrations escalated in June, the $1.4 billion fund has lost about 40% of its assets.
After protesters brought the city’s airport to a standstill on Monday, investors grew increasingly alarmed by the fallout from 10 weeks of anti-government rallies that showed no sign of letting up. The short-term worry is that Hong Kong’s economy is headed for a recession as local turmoil combines with the U.S.-China trade war to pummel retail sales, weigh on real estate prices and sink the city’s $4.9 trillion stock market.
After hitting the lowest level since January, EWH climbed on Tuesday as the Trump administration de-escalated its dispute with China -- sparking demand for risk assets that had been under pressure."
294,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 04:06PM ET</span>",CBS-Viacom is just the beginning of Shari Redstone's media deals,"By Kenneth Li
NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than two months before CBS Corp (N:CBS) and Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) succeeded at a third attempt to recombine, controlling shareholder Shari Redstone had already decided the new company needed to get bigger.
""We would want to look at something after that to ... develop more scale as we move forward,” Redstone said at The Information's Women in Tech, Media and Finance conference in June. 
To the audience of executives in the Times Square (NYSE:SQ) high rise overlooking the storied Paramount building, it was clear that her ambitions went well beyond the hard-won reunion of the two companies her father, Sumner Redstone, put together and then pulled apart 13 years ago during a very different era in media.
She has considered a variety of options that include a sale to a larger company or acquisitions that fall into two categories represented by Sony Entertainment and Discovery, people familiar with her thinking said. 
Even with the combined portfolio of companies that include the CBS television network, CBS News, Showtime cable network and book publisher Simon & Schuster with MTV, Paramount studios and Nickelodeon, the new company, which will be called ViacomCBS Inc, will lack the firepower required to take on the likes of Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), Redstone believed.
By next year, the battle waged by big tech and the last of the remaining media giants will get bloodier when Disney, AT&T Inc (N:T) and Comcast's NBCUniversal join Netflix, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) in the streaming video war for consumer wallets. 
Taken together CBS and Viacom's market capitalization of about $30 billion is dwarfed by Disney's $247 billion and Netflix's $137 billion. 
Viacom, CBS, Redstone's National Amusements, Sony and Discovery declined to comment. 
A purchase of Discovery Inc (O:DISCA) would give it a vast network of popular cable networks and libraries of unscripted shows including the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, the Food Network and HGTV. It would also give ViacomCBS Inc greater exposure in sports and international markets. But a deal would come at a time when consumers are abandoning cable and satellite TV subscriptions in favor of streaming services like Netflix. 
A pursuit of Sony Corp's (T:6758) entertainment divisions would send the message that it will play a bigger role in the streaming video wars in two ways.
Unlike Disney or AT&T's WarnerMedia, ViacomCBS plans to continue to play a hybrid role, both as a direct rival for subscribers and viewers to its free and paid streaming services as well as a producer of movies and shows for companies like Netflix and Amazon. Sony would provide additional content creation resources and a library of content that include ""Spider-Man,"" ""Jumanji,"" ""Hotel Transylvania"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.""
Redstone has not held talks with either companies and neither have expressed interest in a sale or merger for now. 
At the moment, Sony has shown little interest in divesting assets despite flirting with the idea over the three decades it has owned the Hollywood studios. 
Although activist shareholder Daniel Loeb urged Sony to spin off assets in the spring, Sony reaffirmed its commitment to its entertainment division. Its studio has flourished under chief Tony Vinciquerra, and Sony has said it is in the process of once again trying to get its PlayStation, music and movies divisions to work more closely together. 
Discovery, whose Chief Executive David Zaslav was briefly mentioned as a potential candidate to run CBS, is also busy building a non-scripted entertainment, natural history and ""factual programming"" empire. It most recently restructuring a deal with the BBC that will see it launch a global subscription video-on-demand service.
The new company could also rekindle its talks to buy Lions Gate Entertainment Corp's (N:LGFa) Starz cable network. CBS made an informal offer to buy the network for about $5 billion and Lions Gate wanted $5.5 billion. 

It is not immediately clear what the appetite for Starz will be after the merger when current Viacom CEO Bob Bakish will take over, one source familiar with the talks said. Those talks were driven by CBS interim CEO Joe Ianniello, who is expected to report to Bakish, his new boss.

Facebook did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Shares of Facebook pared gains after the report and were up 1.66% at $188.44.
The social media company has been facing broad criticism from lawmakers and regulators over its privacy practices.
Last week, a federal appeals court rejected Facebook's effort to undo a class action lawsuit claiming that it illegally collected and stored biometric data for millions of users without their consent. The company also agreed to pay a record $5 billion fine last month to settle a U.S. Federal Trade Commission data privacy probe.

The United States Trade Representative office said Tuesday that new tariffs on certain consumer items, which were set to go into effect on Sept. 1, would be delayed until Dec. 15, citing health and security factors.
Semiconductor-related goods, including cellphones, laptops and video-game consoles, are also set to be spared, easing fears that U.S. chipmakers such as Nvidia, for whom China is a large source of gaming revenue growth, were set to come under further pressure. 
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose more than 3% amid a sea of green across semis with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) also on track to end the day more than 2% higher. 
The more somber news on trade comes just days ahead of Nvidia’s fiscal second-quarter earnings due Thursday after the close. 
Analysts are optimistic that the company’s gaming sector, which accounts for the bulk of revenue growth, can meet Wall Street expectations. There are doubts, however, over the performance of its data center segment. 
“Fiscal second-quarter gaming revenues, as well as NVDA's fiscal third-quarter forecast, are likely to meet or exceed estimates in our view in light of modest expectations,” Wedbush said in a note to clients. But data center revenues are more of a question mark, the brokerage added.
Nvidia is up about 17% for the year and has a consensus price target from Investing.com of $182.39, suggesting more than 16% of upside from its current price of $156.35.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co (N:CL) is warning Venezuelans not buy fake versions of its toothpaste brands, leading local authorities to issue a health warning, as demand for imported products in Venezuela's dysfunctional economy encourages the spread of knock-off goods.
Colgate, in a statement on Monday, said it had alerted Venezuelan health authorities to the potential risk of the ""commercialization and use of these falsified products,"" without giving further details.
The Venezuelan National Hygiene Institute said it had determined that some toothpastes claiming to be from Colgate did not contain fluoride. Their use posed a health risk because of possible microbiological contamination, the institute said in a public report.
The institute did not mention any reports of health problems but asked Venezuelans to report any that occur.
The fake toothpaste had been imported from China, Mexico and Thailand and had the same color scheme and design as some of Colgate's genuine brands available in Venezuela, the institute said.
Colgate in its Monday statement said buyers could identify the genuine products because the text on the tube and box are in Spanish and show an official sanitary permit.
The institute did not provide details about the number of fake Colgate products in Venezuela or identify the companies producing the toothpaste. Colgate did not respond to Reuters' requests for further comment.
Venezuela's hyperinflationary economic collapse has shuttered most local producers of dental products, stimulating demand for imports of hard-to-find consumer goods like Colgate toothpaste. Many imported goods are sold in black-market stores that do not assess products' quality.

(Reuters) - CBS Corp (N:CBS) and Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) have reached a deal to reunite media mogul Sumner Redstone's U.S. entertainment empire after 13 years apart.
The new company will be named ViacomCBS Inc despite the fact that CBS shareholders will own 61% and Viacom shareholders will own 39%.
Viacom shareholders will receive 0.59625 CBS shares for each share they own, representing a slight premium to Viacom's closing price on Monday.
The merger creates a company with roughly $30-billion market value, which is still small compared to rivals including Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), at $136 billion, ABC network owner Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), at about $245 billion, and NBC owner Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) at $193 billion.
It will combine the CBS television network, CBS News, Showtime cable networks with MTV Networks, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and the Paramount movie studios. Together, they will own more than 140,000 TV episodes and more than 3,600 film titles. Annually, it is estimated to generate about $28 billion in revenue.
The two companies are controlled by National Amusements Inc, the holding company owned by billionaire Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari.
""My father once said ‘content is king,’ and never has that been more true than today,"" Shari Redstone said in a prepared statement. 
The deal represents a victory for Shari Redstone, president of National Amusement, after three attempts since 2016. Previous merger talks had failed because of clashes between executives over divvying up top jobs and the companies' relative valuation.
The recombination comes amid an increasingly competitive media landscape dominated by Disney and Netflix, prompting Redstone to pursue a merger.
Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish will be the President and CEO of the combined company. Joe Ianniello, interim CEO of CBS, will be named Chairman and CEO of CBS, which will exclude the Showtime cable network and book publisher Simon & Schuster.
The companies said they expected about $500 million in annual synergies, or cost savings.
The new board of directors will consist of 13 members. Six will come from independent members from CBS, four independent members from Viacom, Bakish, and two National Amusements members. Shari Redstone will be appointed the chairman.

Shares of Viacom rose 2% to $29.11 and shares of CBS rose 1.8% to $48.91 after the merger was announced.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments' courtroom battle with the IRS over disallowed tax credits drew to a close on Tuesday when lawyers clashed over whether the mutual fund giant was a bonafide partner in the production of chemically treated coal.
U.S. Tax Court Judge David Gustafson said he may deliver his decision in the case as early as Wednesday. The outcome of the trial is being closely watched by Wall Street firms and other U.S. corporations because the production of chemically treated, or refined coal, generates more than $1 billion a year in tax credits. Beneficiaries of the tax credit program include  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and pharmaceutical company Mylan NV (O:MYL), to name a few.
Boston-based Fidelity invested in the production of refined coal at three South Carolina power plants to qualify for tax credits that could total up to $330 million over 10 years. The coal is treated with chemicals to cut mercury and smog pollution.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service, however, disallowed millions of dollars in tax credits and claimed losses reported by a Fidelity-led partnership in 2011 and 2012. The IRS says the partnership had little downside risk and was only created to ""facilitate the prohibited transaction of monetizing refined coal tax credits.""
But Brian Kittle, in his closing arguments on Tuesday in U.S. Tax Court in Boston, argued Fidelity and its partners were bonafide and faced plenty of downside in the form of financial, environmental and reputational risk from their investment.
""Nobody wants to be associated with coal,"" Kittle told Judge Gustafson. Kittle added that Fidelity is seen as a trusted adviser and saw the production of refined coal as an opportunity to earn tax credits and cut pollution.
But the refined coal partnership that also included insurance broker  Arthur J. Gallagher & Co  (N:AJG) and Schneider Electric SE (PA:SCHN) encountered setbacks.
During the two-week trial, Kittle and other lawyers detailed environmental and operational problems as evidence that the partnership was engaged in an investment with plenty of risk potential.
In May 2012, for example, chemicals used to treat coal at the Cross Generating Station in Pineville, South Carolina caused an elevated level of carcinogenic trihalomethanes in the Santee Cooper-Lake Moultrie Public Water System. The refined coal operation at Cross was shut down for three years, limiting the partnership's tax credits."

(Reuters) - The top two U.S. automakers are preparing for a possible economic downturn, the companies said on Tuesday, as an ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing fuels fears of a global recession.
Tit-for-tat tariffs have increased raw material costs for the global auto industry, which is already dealing with weak demand in both China and the United States.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) has a cash buffer of $20 billion for a potential downturn event, Ford North American Chief Financial Officer Matt Fields said at a J.P. Morgan Conference in New York.
General Motors (N:GM) has $18 billion in cash, with the potential to pay two years worth of dividends, the company's finance head, Dhivya Suryadevara, said at the conference.
GM has modeled both moderate and severe downturn scenarios similar to 2008-2009 to get a sense of how it might affect profitability and cash flow at the No.1 U.S. car manufacturer, Suryadevara said.
""It's something that we continually keep watching and updating to make sure that we're all set for when the downturn does come,"" Suryadevara said, adding that company does not see an imminent downturn.
Deferring non-essential capital expenditure and considering a shift to lower-priced vehicles are among the few things GM will look at as part of its ""downturn planning"" to save costs.
Ford said it was ""proactively"" evaluating its future moves, as it works with economists to model the severity of a possible recession.
Fear of a recession has dominated trading on Wall Street this year and spurred a bout of extreme volatility following President Donald Trump's announcement of a new round of tariffs on Aug. 1."

309,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 01:11PM ET</span>",Brick & Mortar fund raises $97 million to make construction tech-savvy,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brick & Mortar Ventures, a venture capital fund founded by a scion of family-run Bechtel Corp, said on Tuesday it had raised $97.2 million from leading construction-related companies as builders turn to 3D printing and other software to cut costs and boost productivity.
San Francisco-based Brick & Mortar initially raised $50 million in late 2017 and the remainder in January to invest in construction, an industry that was slow to embrace technology. The fund is one of the first to try to digitize construction.
Recent deals and valuations surpassing $1 billion, led by Oracle's acquisition of Australian construction management software provider Aconex Ltd for $1.2 billion in 2017 made investors take note of building-related technology start-ups.
""There's now a sense of urgency,"" Darren Bechtel, founder of Brick & Mortar, said in an interview. 
""All of a sudden, the investor market is waking up,"" said Bechtel, whose brother Brendan is chairman and chief executive of Bechtel, one of the world's largest engineering, construction and project management firms. 
The company has not invested in Brick & Mortar. The fund, Brick & Mortar Ventures I LP, its investments and limited partners, were formally announced Tuesday. 
Other investors include software maker  Autodesk Inc  (O:ADSK); Mexican cement company Cemex SAB de CV (MX:CEMEXCPO); Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet company (O:GOOGL); and Obayashi Corp (T:1802), a leading Japanese construction company, among others. 
Two other deals involving construction-related software last year proved Aconex was not a one-off. 
Trimble (O:TRMB) acquired Viewpoint for $1.2 billion in April 2018. Then last November Autodesk paid $875 million for PlanGrid, which had been Bechtel's first investment in building-focused technology back in 2012, when he took part in a $1.1 million seed round of funding, according to Crunchbase.
Big efficiency gains can occur in labor productivity if a company can figure out how to increase time dedicated to work or reduce the number of people out in the field, where 40% to 60% of a project's cost can be labor, Bechtel said.
Resolving the high amount of construction material that is wasted also is ripe for innovation. Some 40% to 50% of the world's solid waste is estimated to be construction materials.

Branch Technologies, a portfolio company, is introducing new ways of construction through 3D printing, which limits waste as only the amount of material needed is used. The days of cutting lumber down to size and discarding the pieces may be over.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 12:59PM ET</span>",U.S. regulators to drop accounting test in 'Volcker' rewrite: sources,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have circulated a new draft of the ""Volcker Rule"" that would further ease its requirements and scrap a proposed new test that had been met with fierce resistance from Wall Street, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The changes will be a relief for Wall Street, which had worried the proposed changes would actually create more headaches for the industry.
Regulators are aiming to vote in coming weeks on the revamped version of the rule, which was introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis to bar banks that accept taxpayer-insured deposits from engaging in short-term speculative trading.
In May 2018, U.S. regulators unveiled a plan to modify the rule, aiming to make compliance easier for firms such as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which have long complained the rule is too complex and subjective.
That first rewrite proposed a new test for assessing whether trades are speculative that would focus on the accounting treatment of the instruments traded, replacing a more subjective test that aims to identify if a trader intended a trade to be speculative. Banks detested the original ""intent"" test, saying it was unworkable and unfair. 
But the industry was equally unhappy with the proposed accounting test, warning it could end up ensnaring a host of other assets that were never meant to be covered by the rule.
The regulators, led by the Federal Reserve, are expected to drop the ""accounting prong"" and rely primarily on two other tests in the original rule to police trading by large banks, the people said.
They are aiming to wrap up the rewrite by the fall, suggesting banks may enjoy relief earlier than anticipated. Some industry executives had worried regulators would open the rule up to industry consultation a second time, further delaying the project by several months. 
The regulators also plan to propose changes to a separate part of the Volcker Rule which governs the relationships banks can have with hedge and private equity funds, according to a person briefed on the matter. 

The regulators will propose simpler rules around those so-called ""covered funds"" relationships that should make life easier for many overseas firms caught by that part of the rule.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 12:56PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Exxon eyes UK North Sea exit after 50-year presence - sources,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) is considering a sale of its assets in the British North Sea after more than 50 years in the oil and gas basin as it focuses on U.S. shale production and new projects.
The world's largest publicly traded energy company has held talks with a number of North Sea operators in recent weeks to gauge interest in some or all of its assets, which could fetch up to $2 billion, according to three industry sources with knowledge of the matter.
Exxon declined to comment.
Leaving the British North Sea would mark a major retreat from Europe for Irving, Texas-headquartered Exxon, which has already put its Norwegian offshore assets on the block.
It would follow similar moves by U.S. rivals  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) which earlier this year sold the bulk of their North Sea operations.
Most of Exxon's operations are managed through a 50-50 joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), known as Esso Exploration and Production UK, and include interests in nearly 40 oil and gas fields.
Shell declined to comment.
Exxon produces around 80,000 barrels of oil and 441 million cubic feet of gas a day in the British North Sea, according to its website. 
Potential buyers could include large private equity-backed North Sea producers such as Chrysaor or Neptune which have acquired portfolios from veteran producers in recent years.
Assigning a value to oil and gas assets in the North Sea is complicated because many fields and infrastructure are nearing the end of their lives and require dismantling, or decommissioning, an expensive process which can offset years of production revenue.
Neivan Boroujerdi, North Sea analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said an Exxon exit was expected, valuing it at around $2 billion.
“Combined with its Norwegian assets, which ExxonMobil recently announced its intention to market, could see the supermajor reach one-third of the way to meeting its $15 billion divestment target,"" Boroujerdi said.
Exxon’s UK business “is attractive. It is highly cash generative, with operating costs around half of the UK average.”
The North Sea has seen a revival in production in recent years due to new fields coming on line and improved performance by operators following the 2014 oil price collapse.
Still, the basin's production is expected to decline over the next decade, according to the UK Oil and Gas Authority.
Should the direct discussions with potential buyers not yield a result, Exxon will consider appointing an external bank to run a formal sale process, two of the sources added.
It was unclear if a sale of assets would require breaking up the Esso joint venture.
Esso has been producing gas since 1968 and oil since 1976, including from the Brent field, which is eponymous with the global crude benchmark and is now being decommissioned.

Exxon's operational focal point in recent years has turned to the United States, where it is rapidly ramping up oil production in the Permian Basin, as well as in Guyana, where it is developing huge, untapped fields.

319,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 12:00PM ET</span>",Boeing deliveries fall 38% in the first seven months of 2019,"(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co delivered 38% fewer planes in the first seven months of 2019 than the same period a year earlier, as the grounding and doubts around the future of its best-selling 737 MAX jets hurt operations.
Deliveries totaled 258 aircraft in the seven months through July, compared to 417 last year, and trailing far behind the 458 aircraft handed over in the same period by European rival Airbus SE.
The numbers put Boeing on course to lose the crown of world's biggest planemaker, which it has held uninterrupted for seven years.
The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide following two fatal accidents that killed more than 300 people and both Boeing and airlines continue to extend the timelines for when it will return to service.
Last month, the company posted its largest-ever quarterly loss due to the spiraling cost of resolving issues with the MAX, warning it may have to halt production of the grounded jet altogether if regulators around the world do not give clearance for it to fly again soon.
A new problem identified with the MAX in June has delayed the aircraft's entry into service until at least the end of September, disrupting schedules for airline operators, who have demanded compensation from Boeing for their loss.
One major client, Southwest, has already removed the MAX from its schedules until early January.
The U.S. planemaker is still ahead of Airbus on combined deliveries of its widebody jets, the 777 and 787 Dreamliner, which stood at 24 and 90, respectively, through the first seven months of 2019, compared with 25 and 80, a year earlier.
Airbus delivered 60 of its widebody A350 jets, up from 46 planes, a year earlier. Deliveries of Airbus's widebody A330 aircraft were 24 planes through July this year.
Both Boeing and Airbus have seen deliveries of their four-engine jumbo jets shrink in recent years as airlines prefer modern fuel efficient twin-engine passenger jets.
Boeing said deliveries of its iconic 747 four-engine jets were flat at four, behind its European competitor the A380 manufactured by Airbus, which saw deliveries of the superjumbo fall to five, from seven last year.

Boeing's net order after cancellations were a negative 88 aircraft so far in 2019, trailing the 79 aircraft orders won by Airbus.

Europe's third-largest budget carrier had to lease replacement planes to service the routes since March due to the global grounding of the Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX, a more costly option than flying its own planes.
Having late last year announced plans to curb its rapid capacity growth and cut costs to stem losses, Norwegian more recently warned that the grounding of the 737 MAX, which makes up 11% of its fleet, may hamper its plans to return to profitability this year..
""Compounded by the global grounding of the 737 MAX and the continued uncertainty of its return to service, this has led us to make the difficult decision to discontinue all six routes from Dublin, Cork and Shannon to the U.S. and Canada from 15 September 2019,"" the company said in a statement.
Norwegian joins others in the travel sector hit by the 737 MAX's problems. Tourism group TUI (DE:TUIGn) warned on Tuesday that the grounding was a big burden as it reported a 46% decline in underlying quarterly core earnings (EBITA).
The airline said it would refund customers who no longer wished to travel from Ireland to the United States and Canada via other destinations. It will continue to fly from Dublin to Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen.
Norwegian launched flights from Ireland to North America in 2017, three years after introducing the UK's first low-cost, long haul flights to the United States.

321,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 10:42AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Citgo chooses new CEO to navigate political, legal turmoil - sources","By Marianna Parraga
(Reuters) - Citgo Petroleum Corp has selected Carlos Jorda as its next chief executive, according to three people familiar with the matter, turning to a seasoned refinery expert and native Venezuelan to run a company facing legal attacks and working under U.S. sanctions against parent Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).
Citgo cut ties with PDVSA earlier this year after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration sanctioned the state-run company and recognized Juan Guaido, Venezuela's congress chief, as the nation's legitimate leader. Citgo officials loyal to President Nicolas Maduro were ousted and new boards for PDVSA and Citgo were named by the Venezuelan congress in February.
An appointment could be announced as soon as this week, after Citgo's board votes on the selection process, according to one of the sources. 
Jorda, 69, was chairman of Citgo Petroleum between 1999 and 2002 and retired from the company in the early 2000s. He is a director at Delek US Holding, an oil refiner based in Tennessee, and an adviser at consultancy Gaffney, Cline & Associates. 
A Citgo spokeswoman referred questions on Jorda and the potential appointment to a June statement acknowledging that the board was searching for a ""leader who can best navigate the complex geopolitical and financial landscape."" 
Jorda, who one person said has not yet formally accepted the offer, could not be reached for comment. PDVSA and a spokesman for Guaido did not reply to requests for comment. 
Venezuelan Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo said over the weekend that the Trump administration is ""stealing"" Citgo, applying ""irrational measures"" and pursuing an economic war against Maduro. 
The next CEO will take over a profitable business with nearly $30 billion in revenue last year, according to company disclosures. Citgo is the eighth largest U.S. refiner by capacity and markets through a network of 5,300 retail outlets.
But it is a company under siege on several fronts: Maduro has his own directors and considers the separation from PDVSA as illegal; creditors want to grab Citgo in payment for Venezuela's debts; and the U.S. Justice Department is probing its role in alleged bribery-for-contracts schemes.
Luisa Palacios, a Venezuelan executive appointed by Guaido to lead Citgo's board, would remain as chair and other directors also would continue, two of the sources said. 
The decision comes as a U.S. court confirmed the Guaido administration's authority to appoint the Citgo board, rejecting a lawsuit by Maduro-appointed officials seeking to retake control of the company. 
Washington last week issued an executive order freezing any property of the Venezuelan government in U.S. territory and opening a window for the enforcement of secondary sanctions on the country, where PDVSA is struggling to allocate and receive cash from exports.
The order, along with new licenses permitting some exceptions, aims to protect Venezuela's overseas assets, especially Citgo, from some creditors while giving power to Guaido's representatives to negotiate with foreign holders of Venezuela's debt.

Citgo operates refineries in Texas, Louisiana and Illinois that can process up to 749,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Shares in its U.S. parent, Citgo Holding, were used by Maduro as collateral for debt due in 2020 and for a loan from Russian oil company Rosneft (MM:ROSN).

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Third Point LLC said on Tuesday that it recently cut its investment in United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), becoming the second activist hedge fund to sell shares after the company announced a merger with  Raytheon Co . (N:RTN) that the funds said they would not support.
The New York-based firm sold 480,000 shares of United Technologies stock during the second quarter, cutting its holding by 7 percent to 6 million shares, according to a regulatory filing made on Tuesday.
In June, Third Point founder Daniel Loeb told the company its plan to merge with Raytheon was a ""baffling change"" in strategy.
Last week William Ackman, another prominent activist investor, told clients that his Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management had sold all of its 5.8 million United Technologies shares.
Ackman was the first to voice strong opposition to the proposed merger and wrote to United Technologies' chief executive in early June that he could not understand the deal's logic.
Both hedge funds, whose moves can influence other investors, told United Technologies that they did not approve of the deal, which is expected to come to a vote next year.
United Technologies is in the process of streamlining its operations, actions both hedge funds endorsed, by selling off its Otis elevator and Carrier buildings systems units.
The sales by both Ackman and Loeb are noteworthy because United Technologies had been big holdings in each man's portfolio.
At Pershing Square, which invests roughly $8 billion, the United Technologies position made up roughly 11 percent of the portfolio at the end of the first quarter. Pershing Square has not yet made its so-called 13-F, a filing that details the amount of U.S. stock held by investment companies at the end of the previous quarter.
While 13-F filings are backward looking, they are closely watched all the same by investors for hints on what big, often secretive hedge funds are thinking. The bulk of the filings will be made on Wednesday.
At Third Point, United Technologies remains the firm's second largest position, making up roughly 10% of its $15 billion portfolio, at the end of the second quarter, Tuesday's filing shows."

LONDON (Reuters) - Concerns about Argentina adding to its long list of sovereign defaults swirled on Tuesday, as investors continued to digest the heavy defeat of pro-reform President Mauricio Macri in the country's primary elections at the weekend.
Credit default swap prices from data provider IHS Markit showed five-year credit default swaps (CDS) marked at 2,116 basis points, up from what was already a five-year high of 1,994 bps the previous day. At those levels, the probability of a default within five years is estimated to be between 70% and 75%.
Argentina last defaulted on its debt in 2001, an event which sparked years of recessions and economic crises.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's Claudio Irigoyen, who used to be the chief economist at Argentina's central bank, cautioned of a worsening outlook as well.
Not only are analysts worried about the economic plans of Alberto Fernandez, the moderate Peronist candidate who romped to victory in Sunday's polls, but also about how a transition of power ahead of October's national elections could potentially occur.
""I think the economy will sink even more, contracting 2% this year with inflation going to 50%,"" Irigoyen said in a note. ""And likely next year... the probability of default will jump to 50% at least.""
Macri's trouncing in the polls made him the latest pro-free market, pro-reform leader to be battered by a populist rival.
Fernandez has said he would seek to ""rework"" Argentina's vital $57-billion standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund if he won October's general election.
Monday's market rout was brutal. The peso lost 15% of its value and Argentinian equities (MERV) sank 48% in dollar terms - the second-biggest one-day slump anywhere since 1950 - while the bond market crash saw a 100-year bond issued to much fanfare two years ago tumble 20%.
Even if markets haven't yet fully priced in a full-blown default, traders are betting on a massive hit to the country's credit rating at the very least.
An S&P Global model using CDS data shows at least a four-notch ratings downgrade now being priced in, from the current level of B to CCC-.
""To sell or not to sell?""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) asked in a note to clients referring to Argentina's bonds.
""Despite the already substantial fall in bond prices, we expect further downside pressure and volatility, and move to a dislike stance on hard currency bonds,"" they said, adding that prices could fall below 55 cents if markets begin to freeze up.
Foreign investors hold a substantial US$109 billion worth of Argentinian bonds, including EM-dedicated funds being 'overweight' on Argentina by 2.3%, they pointed out.
This ""also makes for an even more challenging trading backdrop."""

Brookfield Business Partners LP will purchase 48.9 million shares, or a 57% stake, at C$48.86 apiece in Genworth MI Canada Inc., giving it majority control of Canada’s largest private-sector residential mortgage insurer. That’s a 5.1% discount to Genworth MI’s closing price Monday.
Genworth Financial is looking to “ultimately, moving forward with our long-awaited closing of our merger with Oceanwide,” Chief Executive Officer Tom McInerney said in a statement Tuesday. Oceanwide’s chairman Lu Zhiqiang said the company is “pleased with the quality of the buyer as well as the purchase price they have offered.”
Shares of Genworth Financial jumped 13% in U.S. pre-market trading.
Genworth has been working since 2016 to close its $2.7 billion buyout by China Oceanwide, a transaction McInerney called the “best option” as the Richmond-based insurer grappled with soaring costs on long-term care policies. The insurer said in July that it would seek to gauge interest in the Canadian mortgage insurance unit after lack of “any substantive progress” on talks with regulators in that country for the China Oceanwide deal.
Brookfield plans to fund about $700 million of the purchase on its own and for some of its institutional partners to co-invest alongside it for the rest. Brookfield agreed to provide an $850 million bridge loan to back the transaction, which is expected to close in the second half of the year. The deal is subject to approval from Canada’s minister of finance.
BFIN Securities LP, BMO Capital Markets, CIBC Capital Markets, RBC Capital Markets, and Scotiabank were among financial advisers to Brookfield Business Partners. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Lazard Freres & are acting as financial advisers to Genworth.
Deadline Extended
Genworth and Oceanwide have agreed to extend their merger deadline until Dec. 31.
“Genworth is an industry-leading business that generates strong, consistent earnings and operates in a sector with high barriers to entry,” David Nowak, managing partner, Brookfield Business Partners, said in the statement
The Genworth deal with Oceanwide has been approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., but is pending a decision from Canadian authorities. It also still needs clearance in China for currency conversion, according to the statement Tuesday.
The sale of the Canadian subsidiary comes at a sensitive time for Canadian-Chinese relations. The government is currently studying whether to ban Huawei Technologies Co. from its 5G networks. U.S. charges late last year against the Chinese telco saw its chief financial officer detained in Vancouver at the request of the U.S. Since then, Beijing has detained two Canadians, halted imports of canola and is now turning away meat shipments from Canada.
Home Sales
Genworth MI Canada competes with Canada Guaranty Mortgage Insurance Co. in providing mortgage insurance, alongside the federal government’s Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. In Canada, homebuyers with less than a 20% downpayment are required to get their mortgage insured through one of the three companies.
Alternative lenders have been reaping the benefits of Canada’s tighter mortgage regulations as homebuyers seek financing outside of the big banks in wake of new rules imposed last year. And home prices in big cities have remained lofty. Sales in the city of Toronto have been rebounding all summer from a slump earlier this year as housing supply remains limited, driving prices higher for most segments.

MUNICH (Reuters) - German classifieds group Scout24 (DE:G24n) said on Tuesday it would explore a sale or spin-off of its autos platform and borrow more to buy back shares, after facing calls from activist investor Elliott to boost shareholder returns.
The strategic review marks a concession to Elliott's demand to carve out and sell AutoScout24, which sources close to the U.S. fund say could fetch up to 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion). 
""We can consider a range of options for AutoScout24 and will examine these with an open mind. These could include a sale or spin-off,"" CEO Tobias Hartmann told Reuters at Scout24's headquarters in suburban Munich.
Elliott, in a letter published last week, also urged Scout24 to expand a proposed 300 million euro buyback of stock, saying its share price could top 65 euros if management acts decisively to boost returns to shareholders.
In response, Hartmann told analysts on an earnings call that Scout24 could afford higher long-term leverage - of up to 3.5 times core earnings - to support greater capital return to shareholders.
Shares traded steady at 52.45 euros on Tuesday, up 14% over the past year and valuing the business at 5.6 billion euros.
Hartmann played down talk of tensions with investors calling for faster change at Scout24, which runs Germany's leading property portal and whose autos operation is present in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria.
""Our ideas and those of our investors are not that far apart,"" said Hartmann, who joined Scout24 last year from meal-delivery group HelloFresh (DE:HFGG).
He pointed to a strong operational performance, with group revenue gaining by 20% in the first half, as Scout24 confirmed guidance for revenue to expand by 15%-17% this year, with core profit margins at 52%-54%.
Hartmann said an overhaul announced on July 19, to structure Scout24's property and autos operations as two separate verticals, could expand group operating margins by 200 to 300 basis points by 2021.
BIGGER BUYBACK?
AutoScout24 is the smaller and faster-growing of Scout24's properties, billing itself as the top automotive marketplace in the European Union although in its German home market it lags eBay's (O:EBAY) mobile.de.
""AutoScout24 is not a business that has passed its sell-by date,"" said Hartmann. He declined to comment on speculation that publisher  Axel Springer  (DE:SPRGn) and car trading platform AUTO1 may be interested.
German property site ImmobilienScout24 is, by contrast, more mature and profitable. Sources close to Elliott reckon that ImmobilienScout24 would be worth 5 billion euros as a standalone business - almost as much as Scout24's current market valuation.
The classifieds group has been left facing uncertainty after a takeover bid, at 46 euros per share, by Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) failed earlier this year, despite management's recommendation that shareholders accept the offer.
That bid attracted the attention of activists including Elliott, which has disclosed a stake of more than 7%, and London-based Pelham Capital which has built a slightly larger position.
Scout24's guidance for leverage of up to 3.5 times implies that it could spend an extra 150-180 million euros on share repurchases next year, company sources said. Leverage is seen at 3 times after the buyback already proposed by management.

The company will update shareholders on its deliberations at a capital markets day on Nov. 26.

333,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 07:22AM ET</span>","As Barneys struggles, fashion vendors try on alternative channels","By Sarah White and Melissa Fares
PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When fashion label Prada (HK:1913) started demanding greater control over shop floor arrangements in U.S. department stores, Barneys New York, now mired in bankruptcy proceedings, was one of the few with enough swagger to resist.
The luxury retailer, respected by its well-heeled clients for its selection, said in interviews at the time it wanted to maintain its influence over buying the merchandise rather than ceding to a leased shop-in-shop controlled by the brand.
Prada eventually reintroduced its women's styles to the department store after a three-year hiatus, and still counts Barneys as a wholesale partner, a person close to the label said.
But if that stand-off ended well for Barneys, its bankruptcy last week may give fashion and luxury brands new motivation to move beyond wholesale arrangements with department stores, to focus on their own stores and websites.
""Most luxury vendors prefer to sell at their own stores, rather than in wholesale,"" said Jerry Storch, chief executive officer of consultancy Storch Advisors.
While fashion brands still like Barneys' trend-setting vibe, direct sales are far more profitable than wholesale arrangements, and vendors ultimately want to be in control of their own operations and brand experience, Storch said.
Barneys New York owes some $1.6 million to Prada alone, as well as millions more to labels from  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s Gucci to LVMH (PA:LVMH)'s Givenchy, according to its bankruptcy filings, and friction with vendors had been building up.
According to Barneys' court filings, merchandise shipments began to slow over the summer, with many vendors refusing to send their inventory unless they got cash on delivery.
""There was a lot of talk among brands about finding other distribution channels,"" one source familiar with Barneys' supplier network said. ""They'd been paying late, in the market, everyone knew that.""
Barneys has until Oct. 24 to avoid liquidation by finding a buyer and clinching a sale, according to terms of its bankruptcy financing outlined during a court hearing last week.
""Barneys is committed to working closely with our vendors to ensure we continue providing our customers with excellent services, products and experiences,"" a company spokeswoman told Reuters.
    ""We have secured approximately $218 million in new financing from partners who have directly expressed confidence in our ability to achieve a value-enhancing transaction,"" she said. ""This capital will be used, in part, to ensure our long-standing relationships with our vendor partners who are so essential to our future success.""
For major luxury brands, hiccups in the wholesale chain only compound the allure of controlling their own wares with their own stores, as they seek to master their image by avoiding mark-downs, gain flexibility to roll out products at varying paces, increase brand exposure, and boost margins - and the trend in that direction is picking up.
PRADA'S PUSH INTO MINI-STORES
Prada, with just under 20% of revenues derived from wholesale accounts, wants to whittle that down to 5% over the next three to five years, Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli told analysts in early August.
The bulk of that reduction will fall on Italy and the rest of Europe. Prada had already transformed some 40 sale locations in U.S. department stores into concessions, essentially mini stores brands operate within host department stores.
The concessions model is already more prevalent in Europe. Parisian department stores like Galeries Lafayette are a maze of branded shop-in-shops. But it is a cultural shift for many U.S. luxury retailers including Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL] and Macy's Inc's (N:M) Bloomingdale's, where concessions are somewhat less common.
Barneys does not do concessions across any category in general. Barneys recently hosted limited-time pop-ups with brands such as Chanel, Bulgari and Moynat.
""Department stores that move to concessions don't need an internal buying team to select merchandise anymore,"" said Mario Ortelli, managing partner at luxury consultancy Ortelli & Co. ""What they have to do is create the right retail environment to generate store traffic and attract the brands.""
Another industry source said that concession fees, where retailers typically get around 30% of sales, are starting to fall as brands are in a stronger position to negotiate.
If brands have more say about where and how their merchandise is sold, some may choose to exit less profitable department store locations.
""That's a real risk for the major department stores because they depend on having the big name brands in their stores to give them credibility, so the pressure is really on,"" said Ron Frasch, the former president at retailer Saks Fifth Avenue as well as its rival Bergdorf Goodman.
The Barneys department store chain, struggling with declining sales and soaring rent, plans to close 15 locations and wants to keep seven stores - including its flagship on Madison Avenue in New York - open for business.
Vendors are also increasingly exploring other means of distributing merchandise via partnerships with players like Rent the Runway, Richemont's (S:CFR) Yoox Net-a-Porter and  Stitch Fix  Inc (O:SFIX).
To fend off some of this competition, some high-end department-store chains have formed partnerships of their own.
In June, for example,  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) and Rent the Runway announced a tie-up that aims to draw more foot traffic into the department store while making the clothing rental service more convenient.
In April, struggling upscale U.S. retailer Neiman Marcus took a minority stake in online luxury reseller Fashionphile. In 2016, the luxury department store also teamed up with Rent the Runway and opened its first in-store Rent the Runway shop in a bid to attract younger shoppers."

The company has been making losses of up to $4 billion a year since it initially flagged holes in its accounts in December 2017. 
In its first presentation to investors since then, the retailer's chief executive Louis du Preez said its ""only way to survive"" was to slim down into a pure investment holding company focused on retail. 
To achieve that Steinhoff is looking to sell off its non-retail assets and cut jobs at its French retail chain Conforma, its management said during the presentation. 
The accounting scandal at Steinhoff shocked investors that had backed its transformation from a small South African furniture outfit into a discount furniture retailer straddling four continents. 
Executives said its fallout means the company, which owns Mattress Firm Inc in the United States and Fantastic chains in Australia, and is also listed in Frankfurt (DE:SNHG), will be fighting to return to profitability for years to come even with strong turnover.

CEO du Preez also said Steinhoff's debt - totaling over 9 billion euros ($10.09 billion) - was too high and needed to be urgently addressed.

Inventec, which also assembles Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s AirPods, will migrate its entire American-bound laptop operation to its home base of Taiwan, President Maurice Wu said. It aims to complete that wholesale move within two to three months, Wu told investors on a post-earnings call Tuesday. His company is a major producer of notebook computers for HP, which accounts for an estimated third of its revenue. It also intends to shift more output of smart devices to Taiwan and Malaysia, Inventec executive David Ho said without elaborating.
From Inventec to Apple-assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the Taiwanese companies that make most of the world’s electronics are reconsidering their reliance on the world’s No. 2 economy as Washington-Beijing tensions simmer. Rising tariffs on Chinese-made products threaten to wipe out their margins and up-end a well-oiled, decades-old supply chain.
“The trade war is very painful for us,” Wu said, concluding a call during which executives shared how production shifts have hurt the company’s efficiency and margins.
Inventec’s shift marks one of the largest envisioned moves in production since Trump announced his decision to slap 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports -- including consumer gadgets from smartphones to notebooks -- starting September. Spurred on by clients, which include household names like Dell Technologies Inc. and Nintendo Co (T:7974)., many Taiwanese contract manufacturers are now drawing up contingency plans, shifting select assembly operations or exploring alternative venues.
On Tuesday, Compal Electronics Inc. Chief Executive Officer Martin Wong said his company, a rival to Inventec, has also shifted some notebook lines to Taiwan and was considering investing more in Vietnam should tariff-conflicts persist.
Still, few major manufacturers have moved output in truly significant amounts and China’s status as the world’s production base for electronics is unlikely to diminish anytime soon. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google has already shifted much of its production of U.S.-bound motherboards to Taiwan, averting a 25% tariff, Bloomberg News has reported.

341,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 05:55AM ET</span>",China’s 10-Year Bond Yield Falls to 3% for First Time Since 2016,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s 10-year sovereign bond yield fell to 3% for the first time since 2016, joining a global rally of government debt as the nation’s economy slowed and its trade dispute with the U.S. worsened.
The yield on the country’s most-active notes due in a decade fell 1 basis point to briefly trade at 3% in Shanghai. Escalations in the trade war since April have put a damper on sentiment in equities, helping spur a rally in Chinese sovereign bonds. The yield on the country’s 10-year debt, which hadn’t touched 3% since November 2016, is down about 40 basis points since its April peak.
The advance in Chinese bonds followed a rally in their U.S. counterparts, as the yields on American long-end debt approached an all-time low overnight amid rising global trade concerns, political upheaval in Hong Kong and a crisis in Argentina. China’s economy also showed fresh signs of slowing, with data released on Monday suggesting the nation’s credit demand tumbled to the second-lowest amount this year in July.
""The drop in the yield is probably a result of the rally in U.S. government bonds and the disappointing credit data,"" said Wu Sijie, a senior trader at China Merchants Bank Co. ""The room for the decline is limited if China doesn’t lower rates for its medium-term lending facility.""
The yield on the 10-year sovereign note was at 3.01% Tuesday afternoon in Shanghai. The returns still stand out just as the world’s stockpile of negative-yielding bonds nears $16 trillion for the first time.
China’s Lowest Bond Yields Since 2016 Look Really Juicy to Some
China’s sovereign bonds lagged a global rally in recent months with one of the worst performances among the world’s biggest debt markets. Even as weak economic data strengthened the case for further stimulus, concern over credit risks after the government takeover of a lender were among the reasons seen deterring investors.
The bull case for Chinese bonds is pegged on potential easing by China’s central bank and an increase in foreign flows helped by their inclusion in global indexes. But risks include a potentially wild yuan, which makes assets denominated in the Chinese currency less attractive to overseas investors. An escalation of the trade war could send the yuan to as low as 7.7 per dollar, according to  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA.
China’s stimulus plans may also disappoint bond bulls -- the People’s Bank of China signaled Friday it will hold back from deploying large-scale measures for now.
Stocks fell across Asia on Tuesday and bonds rallied as investors shunned risk assets. Hong Kong’s deepening political crisis -- which now risks becoming an economic one -- and fears of another default in Argentina are adding to the concern over global growth.
“The world is in risk-off mode due to rising geopolitical tensions globally, and the Hong Kong unrest is part of the puzzle affecting the sentiment,"" Tommy Xie, economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. It’s a good time to buy Chinese government bonds at the moment, he added.
Here’s what some fund managers say:
Pengyang Asset Management Co. (Yang Aibin, portfolio manager)
China’s bond rally isn’t over yet and the 10-year government bond yield may still challenge the 2016 low of around 2.65% The downward trend that pushed the yield down to 3% is mainly being driven by global trade concerns and China’s slowing credit growth Hexa AMC (Li Haitao, deputy director of fund investment)

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Apprehension over capital outflows triggered by escalating political unrest has driven Hong Kong's stock market to its lowest this year and pressured its currency, with analysts warning of more weakness.
The Hang Seng Index (HSI) fell 2.1% to 25,281.30 points on Tuesday, down 16% from the year's peak, and is at lows last seen in early January.
It has fallen over 8% since June 12, when street clashes escalated between anti-government demonstrators and the police.
Now into their third month, those protests ground Hong Kong's airport to a halt this week and forced flight cancellations even as both protester and police tactics turned increasingly violent.
Concerns over China's slowdown, as the Sino-U.S. trade war remains unresolved, have also dragged on Hong Kong's economy. The Hang Seng is Asia's second-worst performer after South Korea's this quarter.
Other risk indicators in markets are flashing red.
The Hong Kong dollar , pegged to the greenback at 7.75-7.85, was trading at 7.8465.
""The recent mounting social unrest was fuelling political risk and in turn capital outflow pressure,"" Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank, said in a note on Tuesday. ""We do not rule out HKD falling to 7.85 level again.""
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam pleaded on Tuesday for a stop to the protests, having warned of an economic ""tsunami"" engulfing the city last week.
The protests have angered Beijing, which called them ""sprouts of terrorism"".
""Dropping the 'T' word is particularly disturbing as it does suggest a more aggressive mainland response, which triggered a wave of risk aversion across global markets,"" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at VM Markets in Singapore, referring to Beijing's response.
In the forex options market, risk reversal spreads were at their highest since 2016 on Monday in favor of dollar calls, suggesting investors are paying a high premium to bet on the Hong Kong dollar's drop.
A CSOP Asset Management ETF that allows investors to bet against the Hang Seng (HK:7500) jumped to its highest on Tuesday since launching in May.
The product broke its record in turnover of HK$916.2 million ($116.8 million) on Aug. 6, one day after protesters gridlocked Hong Kong with a general strike and the Chinese yuan fell to the weaker side of 7-per-dollar.
Local interbank rates have not moved much but a key gauge of cash levels in Hong Kong, banks' aggregate balances held with the central bank, stood at HK$54.4 billion as of Tuesday - an 87% decline from its 2015 peak, when the city attracted foreign inflows as global central banks kept interest rates at historic lows.

Bosch, the latest firm to flag weak conditions in the Indian auto market, said its automotive sales dived 17.5% in the June quarter.
The outlook for the auto industry was ""extremely"" challenging, Managing Director Soumitra Bhattacharya said in a statement.
Bosch, which makes a wide range of auto products including braking systems and batteries, is the latest firm to restructure its business or limit production due to the slowdown, which has been exacerbated in recent months by a liquidity crunch in India's shadow banking sector.
Automakers  Tata Motors Ltd  (NS:TAMO) and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) (NS:MAHM) said last week they would cut production at some plants in response to slowing demand that industry executives say has driven the sector to one of its worst downturns.
Earlier on Tuesday, an auto industry body said India's domestic passenger vehicle sales in July had fallen at the steepest pace in nearly two decades.
Bosch has earmarked 820 million rupees ($11.5 million) as a provision for restructuring, which would include ""manpower adjustments,"" it said.
""The slowdown is not cyclical, but structural,"" Bhattacharya said. ""Necessary course correction measures will be taken in order to remain competitive.""
Shares in Bosch's Indian unit dropped 3.4% following the news of restructuring. The company's profit in the three months ended June dived 35% to 2.8 billion rupees, while revenue from operations dropped 13.5% to 27.79 billion rupees.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares slumped on Tuesday as fears about a drawn out Sino-U.S. trade war, protests in Hong Kong and a crash in Argentina's peso currency drove investors to safe harbors like bonds, gold, and the yen.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 1%. Chinese stocks fell 1%, while Hong Kong's main market index tumbled 1.7% to a seven-month low.
""The protests in Hong Kong are negative for stocks, which were already in an adjustment phase because there is talk that the trade war will trigger a recession,"" said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co.
Hong Kong's airport, the world's busiest cargo airport, reopened on Tuesday after protesters managed to close it down the previous day. The mood remained cautious as the increasingly violent demonstrations have plunged the Chinese-ruled territory into its most serious crisis in decades.
The weeks-long protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extraditions to mainland China but have quickly morphed into the biggest challenge to China's authority over the city since it took Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997.
Japan's Nikkei was also hit hard, down a sharp 1.2% and on course for its biggest daily decline in a week.
In early European trade, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were unchanged.
U.S. stock futures were 0.23% higher in Asia, but that did little to calm the fragile mood.
Stocks in Singapore shed 1.1% to reach their lowest since June 6 after the government slashed its full-year economic growth forecasts. The city state is often seen as a bellwether for global growth because of its importance as a key trade hub.
The selling in regional markets came as Wall Street stocks took a beating on Monday, with the S&P 500 losing 1.23%.
Sentiment was already weak due to increasing signs that the United States and China will not quickly resolve their year-long trade war. Markets were hit with further turbulence after protesters managed to close down Hong Kong's airport on Monday.
Traders were also on edge after market-friendly Argentine President Mauricio Macri suffered a mauling in presidential primaries, increasing the risk of a return to interventionist economic policies.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were near the lowest in almost three years, gold was pinned close to six-year highs, and the yen was within a whisker of a seven-month peak versus the dollar in a sign of the heightened anxiety in financial markets already battered by global growth woes.
""Long-term rates will continue to fall, and stocks will adjust lower, but this is temporary. Major central banks are cutting rates, which will eventually provide economic support,"" Mitsubishi UFJ's Ishigane said.
Analysts said that trading could be subdued as many investors are off for summer holidays. Yet, there was no shortage of gloomy news for investors looking to catch their breath from several months of market ructions.
Argentina's peso collapsed on Monday, losing roughly 15% of its value to 52.15 per dollar after crumbling to an all-time low of 61.99 earlier. Voters snubbed Macri by giving the opposition a surprisingly bigger-than-expected victory in Sunday's primary election.
The Merval stock index (MERV) crashed 30% and declines of between 18-20 cents in Argentina's benchmark 10-year bonds left them trading at around 60 cents on the dollar or even lower.
Refinitiv data showed Argentine stocks, bonds and the peso had not recorded this kind of simultaneous fall since the South American country's 2001 economic crisis and debt default.
The grim backdrop was enough to push investors into safe-havens, and U.S. Treasury yields dropped across the board on Monday as trade worries and political tensions supported safe-haven assets.
In Asia on Tuesday benchmark 10-year Treasuries yields fell to 1.6403%. On August 7 yields had skidded to 1.5950%, the lowest since October 3, 2016.
Spot gold rose 0.47% to $1.518.43 per ounce, near the highest in six years.
The yen last fetched 105.41 per dollar, and was within striking distance of 105.03, its strongest since the January 3 flash crash.

347,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 03:57AM ET</span>",An Earnings Beat Doesn’t Help Banks’ Bleak Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Once again, European banks tried hard in the latest earnings season, but ultimately failed to boost sentiment. Expectations were low and hence several lenders were able to post a beat, yet many banks warned of a challenging outlook as yields in Europe hit all-time lows.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) notes that seven out of nine regional markets under their coverage were able to surpass estimates, with the strongest positive surprises from Spanish and Swiss lenders.
But the results were not enough to create a lasting positive impact overall as analysts pointed to low quality numbers driven by investment banking, which might not be sustainable, or lower provisions and other one-time effects.
Strategists at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) say the past quarter’s pretax profit growth remained negative for a second time, representing a “significant inflection point” as the industry’s profitability seems to have peaked in 2018.
Revenue headwinds have accelerated since the ECB added a more dovish bias into its monetary policy outlook, while leaving the market waiting for any decision on tiering which would mitigate the effects of low rates on banks.
The outlook for net interest income and margins has deteriorated and Deutsche Bank’s analyst expects the rate pressure to intensify as forward-looking curves have significantly declined. Shaky markets also paint an unlikely scenario for investors to do a lot of trading or look for (high-fee) risky assets. The consequence: fees fell 6% from the previous quarter.
And the headwinds won’t stop with rates or fees as banks face the prospect of higher provisions as the trade spat’s marks on the global economy get bigger with the credit cycle at an advanced stage. After falling for eight consecutive periods, provisions rose in both quarters this year overall.
So it’s little wonder that the earnings consensus has dropped 7 percentage points for 2019 and another 10 points for 2020, according to Citigroup’s calculations. Hence bank shares are Europe’s worst-performing sector this year, with the SX7P down 10% YTD -- and they might struggle to change that. In the meantime, Euro Stoxx 50 futures are down 0.2% ahead of today’s open.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 03:37AM ET</span>",China's tech firms to post slower June-quarter growth on sagging demand,"By Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - China's top technology, e-commerce and consumer electronic firms are set to report a sharp slowdown in revenue growth for the June quarter, as a bruising trade war with the United States weighed on the Chinese economy and hurt consumer spending.
Revenues at a handful of China's biggest tech firms are expected to grow 26% on average in the quarter ended June 30 - the slowest in six quarters - compared with the same period a year earlier, according to consensus estimates from Refinitiv. This includes China's e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Corp (K:BABA) and its smaller rival JD.com (O:JD), internet firm Baidu Inc (O:BIDU), and Tencent Holdings (HK:0700), the world's largest gaming company.
Net income at these companies is expected to grow 9%, versus a galloping 50% increase a year earlier.
The trade war has roiled markets and global supply chains and forced tech companies to rethink production and marketing tactics. A lackluster June quarter is expected to prompt firms to cut costs further to shore up margins.
China's economic growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years. 
""Given the slowing economy and tightening of credit within China, we can expect to see this reflected in ... different ways,"" said Taipei-based technology analyst Sam Reynolds. ""For the more business-to-consumer focused companies, this will be reflected in slower consumer spending; for the more business-to-business companies (like Baidu) this will be reflected in less ad buys.""
Below are some expected milestones for these firms that are scheduled to report results in the coming weeks, based on Refinitiv data:
** JD.com, which is expected to report earnings on Tuesday, could manage to eke out a small profit by curbing costs. But with fewer consumers buying household appliances and electronics, the online retailer is likely to post its slowest revenue growth in at least five years.
** Alibaba's profit likely grew 27%, its fourth successive quarterly rise. Big promotions are expected to propel its sales 38% higher, but that will be the company's slowest growth in 14 quarters.
** Tencent is expected to post profit growth of 24%, versus a 2% decline a year earlier, helped by adoption of its patriotic-themed video games and cloud services. The music-streaming unit it backs - Tencent Music (N:TME) - on Monday missed revenue estimates as it reported the slowest increase in a widely watched metric for growth since its debut in December.
** Alibaba and Tencent, China's biggest listed companies, have together lost roughly $96 billion in market value since the trade war took a turn for the worse in May.
** Baidu's profit likely fell 71%, its third straight quarterly decline as it invested to keep up with competition from privately held ByteDance. Revenue is expected to fall 0.8%, its first decline in 10 quarters.
** Smartphone maker  Xiaomi  Corp's (HK:1810) revenue growth is expected to be the slowest since its initial public offering in July last year. 
** OLED display panel maker BOE Technology (SZ:000725) - among China's big bets to counter U.S. tech - is expected to post 26% income growth, its second straight quarter of profit growth after three successive quarters of decline.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI) shares saw their biggest intraday rise in a more than a decade on Tuesday, after it set a target to reach zero net debt within 18 months and vowed to reward shareholders with higher dividends and periodic bonus issues. 
The group's billionaire chairman, Mukesh Ambani, also unveiled plans to launch cut-price home internet services across India next month, threatening to disrupt the telco market with offers of free voice calls for life, television and movie streaming, and even TV sets to go with some subscription plans.
The announcements drove Reliance shares up as much as 12% - its biggest such move since Jan. 14, 2009. The spike has put the company within touching distance of becoming the highest-valued Indian company again. Currently, it trails  Tata Consultancy Services  (NS:TCS) by slightly more than $1 billion.
But shares of telecom majors  Bharti Airtel  (NS:BRTI) fell 4% and Vodafone Idea (NS:VODA) slid almost 5% as the announcements spurred worries of a repeat of what happened just three years ago when Reliance's Jio burst on to the scene.
Jio, with cheap data plans and freebies, has managed to become India's top mobile operator by subscribers and the second-biggest globally over the three years. 
Ambani said, at Reliance's annual general meeting (AGM) on Monday, that customers of Reliance's Premium Jiofiber broadband services ""will be able to watch movies in their living rooms the same day these movies are released in theaters"".
Shares of multiplex chain operators PVR (NS:PVRL) and Inox Leisure (NS:INOX) fell as much as 8% and 10%, respectively, on the news, after trading resumed following a holiday on Monday. 
Shares in Dish TV India (NS:DSTV) were also down.
As of 0606 GMT, Reliance shares were up about 10%, while the broader market (NSEI) was down slightly.

Reliance shares were also buoyed by the news that Saudi Aramco plans to invest roughly $15 billion for a 20% stake in its oil-to-chemicals business.

355,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 01:38AM ET</span>",Argentina Default Fear Looms as Traders Dump Assets,"(Bloomberg) -- Suddenly, fears of a full-blown financial crisis in Argentina have once again come rushing to the fore.
In the wake of President Mauricio Macri’s stunning rout in primary elections over the weekend, investors dumped its stocks, bonds and currency en masse in a selloff that left much of Wall Street wondering whether the crisis-prone country was headed for yet another default.
The upset, widely seen as a preview of October’s presidential vote, threw the doors open to the very real possibility a more protectionist government will take power come December and unravel the hard-won gains that Macri made to regain the trust of the international markets. It deepened worries his populist opponent, Alberto Fernandez, and running mate, former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, will try to renegotiate its debts as well as its agreements with the International Monetary Fund. The country has billions in foreign-currency debt due over the coming year.
“The market is starting to price in default,” said Edwin Gutierrez, the London-based head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Asset Management. “The market is unwilling to give Fernandez the benefit of the doubt.”
Credit-default swaps now show that traders are pricing in a 75% chance that Argentina will suspend debt payments in the next five years. On Friday, the likelihood was just 49%. Its dollar-denominated government bonds lost roughly 25% on average, pushing down prices to as low as 55 cents on the dollar. Yields on shorter-maturity notes soared past 35%.
The peso tumbled as much as 25% to a record-low 60 per dollar Monday and the Merval stock index lost the most ever in intraday trading.
Expected to trail his opponent by just a few points, Macri was instead pummeled at the polls Sunday, with voters giving Fernandez a 15-point lead. The sudden shift in voter sentiment shocked foreign investors and Argentines alike, who have suffered through years of high inflation, economic malaise and political division.
Argentina has a long history of fiscal crises and it was only in 2016, under Macri, that the country put its most recent sovereign default behind it. Argentines still remember the 15-year default saga and deep recessions following a record default in 2001.
The government and its subsidiaries currently have $15.9 billion in debt payments denominated in dollars and euros due in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There are another $18.6 billion in bond principal, loans and interest payments issued in pesos.
Investors are fearing the worst. Fernandez was cabinet chief under former President Nestor Kirchner, while his vice presidential pick, Cristina Kirchner, led the republic for eight years before Macri came to power. During her time in office, Argentina was marked by currency controls, data manipulation and protectionist policies on trade to protect national industry. And, of course, it was also punctuated by another default that made the country an international pariah for years.
QuickTake: Why Kirchner’s Comeback Goes Through Argentine Court
“It is going to be an extremely tough period for Argentinian assets,” said Marcin Lipka, a senior analyst at brokerage Cinkciarz.pl in Zielona Gora, Poland. “Without moderation of the Fernandez duo and regarding increasing expectations of another fight with the IMF, I would not exclude that peso could hit 100 level to the dollar in the next 12-month period.”
Lipka, whose outlook on Latin America currencies has been among the most accurate since the second quarter of 2018, said a rate of 100 pesos per dollar wasn’t his base case, but that he does expect extreme volatility in the coming weeks. There’s a risk the currency will be doubly hit amid liquidity issues, capital outflows and string inflation pressure.
Luiz Ribeiro, the lead money manager for Latin American equities at DWS Group in Sao Paulo, said he will probably cut his exposure to Argentina in half. His Latin American equity fund outperformed 92% of rivals in the past year after building up holdings in Argentina amid expectations of political continuity.
“What we are pricing right now is radical change in economic policies,” he said in an interview. Still he’s staying overweight relative to the benchmark as “Alberto Fernandez could come up with more moderate speech, which I think is possible given the kind of turmoil we see in the market right now.”
It’s also possible, though would be difficult, that Macri could come back as the Oct. 27 election approaches, he said.
“If Fernandez comes out with some market friendly comments (especially on the IMF front) and/or a credible economics team, this would certainly help the sentiment,” said Esther Law, senior portfolio manager for emerging-market debt at Amundi Asset Management in London. “There is a chance for this but it is difficult to predict the timing.”
In a press conference Monday, Macri said he still has a shot to reverse the trend in October and that his economic team is working on measures to address voter concerns on the economy. He also said that the market and international community lack confidence in Fernandez and the opposition as evidenced by the selloff.
While the market was hoping for Fernandez to give some words of encouragement to investors who are desperate to know his government plans, he made no apparent overtures during his victory speech on Sunday.
On Monday, he told a local radio network that the securities regulator should look into information shared late last week that prompted a rally ahead of the vote.
He suggested that the market look to Macri for answers rather than to him and that the reaction shows how investors react when they feel they’ve been “ripped off.”

The Hang Seng Index last traded at 25,428 by 10:50 PM ET (02:50 GMT), down 1.55%. Hong Kong’s airport reopened today after halting all flights on Monday as protestors occupied the arrival halls for the past few days, although reports suggested the occupying have been peaceful.
The airport said flights will be rescheduled today, but flights movements are expected to be limited. Cathay Pacific Airways Limited (HK:0293) stated that it had cancelled over 200 flights today, according to its website.
On Monday, protestors again blamed police for using excessive force as they fired tear gas and bean bag pellets at close range. Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office spokesman Yang Guang said on the same day in a press conference that protestors “have been frequently using extremely dangerous tools to attack the police in recent days, constituting serious crimes with sprouts of terrorism emerging.”
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component traded 0.7% and 0.9% lower. Although not a directional driver, data showed foreign direct investment in China gained 7.3% from a year ago in the first seven months of the year.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.7%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 dropped 0.3%. A survey showed the country’s National Australia Bank’s index of business conditions was down 2 points to +2 in July.
""The decline in business conditions since early 2018 has been broad-based and has continued to track at below average levels in recent months,"" said NAB group chief economist Alan Oster.
""This is concerning, because while conditions remain positive, it points to a significant loss in momentum in the business sector,” he noted.
Meanwhile, Singapore slashed its forecast of 2019 full year GDP growth to zero to 1% from the previous 1.5% to 2.5%. Second-quarter GDP fell 3.3% quarter-on-quarter, more than the expected 2.9%.
“Looking ahead, GDP growth in many of Singapore’s key final demand markets in the second half of 2019 is expected to slow from, or remain similar to, that recorded in the first half,” the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a statement on Tuesday."
357,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 11:37PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Stocks Resume Retreat as Protest Fallout Deepens,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s stocks fell amid renewed pressure after protesters brought the city’s airport to a standstill Monday, highlighting the economic fallout from 10 weeks of anti-government demonstrations that show no sign of easing.
The Hang Seng Index fell as much as 1.5% Tuesday, with developers and casinos among leading decliners. A gauge of property developers slipped 1.6% while a Bloomberg measure of Macau casino stocks dropped 2.3% as of 9:55 am in the city. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, which on Monday tumbled to its lowest levels in a decade after drawing China’s wrath over Hong Kong protests, fell as much as 5%.
Protesters swarmed the airport Monday, causing the biggest disruption yet to the city since the unrest began in June. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese firms has lost 16% since its April high, not far from entering a technical bear market. The MSCI Hong Kong Index fell 2.1%. The gauge has fallen 14% since mid-July.
The threat from the trade war and weeks of local unrest is already showing in the property market, as well as tourist numbers, hotel occupancy and retail sales. A weak yuan is another cause for concern, as it will damp spending from mainland visitors and pressure earnings for firms that rely on China. Profits for members of the Hang Seng Index are forecast to drop the most since the global financial crisis this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
“It looks like the situation will get worse,” said Airy Lau, investment director at Fair Capital Management Ltd. “Together with the higher global recession risk from U.S.-China friction, the Hang Seng Index is likely to have 5-10% more downside.”
Swire Properties Ltd. -- which operates malls and hotels in the city -- fell 2.2%, taking its losses since June 10 to 23%. MTR Corp., regarded as one of Hong Kong’s safest stocks before the protests began, slipped as much as 3.1%.
Mainland investors have made the most of the slump in Hong Kong-listed equities, purchasing stocks through exchange links every day this month. They bought a net $289 million worth of the city’s shares on Monday, even as onshore markets rallied. The Hong Kong dollar strengthened as much as 0.02% on Tuesday."
358,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 11:37PM ET</span>","Tencent-Backed Kuaishou, Baidu Invest $434 Million in Zhihu","(Bloomberg) -- Zhihu, China’s answer to online Q&A service Quora, raised $434 million from investors including some of the country’s largest social media companies and the leading search service to bankroll its expansion.
Kuaishou, one of the biggest live-streaming platforms, led the investment in Zhihu, according to a statement from China Renaissance Holdings Ltd., which advised on the deal. Zhihu, whose name means “know?” in Chinese, also snagged search giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). as a new investor. Existing backers Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Capital Today also invested in the new round.
The investments could help Kuaishou and Baidu amass more content and fend off competition from ByteDance Inc., which is moving into search and drawing smartphone-savvy users to its popular short video and personalized news services. Through the financing, Baidu will add more than 100 million Zhihu Q&A posts to its main app, which is a combination of a search engine and news feed, Baidu said in a statement.
”We are all facing the same problem of an isolated island of information, and the cost of high-quality content is rising,” Zhihu Chief Executive Officer Zhou Yuan said on his own service after the investment was announced.
Founded by coder-turned-blogger Zhou, Zhihu has evolved over the past eight years to become one of China’s most reputable social media platforms, known for its high-quality Q&As on everything from films to football and foreign policy.
Zhihu is “recognized for its unique knowledge creation and sharing community,” Wang Lixing, a China Renaissance managing director, said in the statement. “The cooperation between Zhihu, Kuaishou and Baidu will create huge synergies and lay the foundation for long-term development.”

The stock fell as much as 5.4% and was down 4.2% at HK$9.39 at 10:29 a.m. in Hong Kong, headed for its lowest close since April 2009. The airline’s parent, Swire Pacific Ltd., also dropped.
The flight cancellations compounded the headwinds facing the company, which has emerged as the most visible corporate target for China amid the protests that have been gripping the former British colony for more than two months. Bocom International Holdings Co. cut its investment rating on the stock, citing near-term uncertainties.
China hit out at the airline last week after its employees joined anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong. Some state-run Chinese companies have also told employees to stop flying Cathay flights, according to people familiar with the matter."

The judgment, issued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, made permanent an earlier order against the TWU-IAM Association demanding the workers stop interfering in American's operations.
American filed a lawsuit in May against the union group after stalled contract negotiations that were being overseen by a federal mediator.
At the time, American said alleged disruption by the mechanics had caused hundreds of flight cancellations and even more maintenance delays. 
The union group denied the accusations in court.

Monday's order prohibits employees from ""calling, permitting, instigating, authorizing, encouraging, participating in, approving, or continuing any form of disruption to or interference with American's airline operations,"" including a refusal to accept overtime or complete any maintenance repairs in the normal course of work.

361,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 09:57PM ET</span>",Stocks - Markets Battered Again and Rates Sink as Trade Jitters Persist,"Investing.com - Stocks plunged Monday and bonds jumped thanks to a miserable combination of trade worries, the worsening civil strife in Hong Kong and fears about global growth generally.
The S&P 500 was off 1.23%. The Dow Jones industrials fell 1.48%, and the Nasdaq Composite had given up 1.20%. The Nasdaq 100 index, reflecting Big Tech, dropped 1.1%.
The Dow was off as many as 462 points before some modest late-day bargain hunting kicked in.
The major averages have fallen about 5% from their peaks in late July. Long-term bond yields tumbled, with the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury falling to as little as six basis points. The spread was the lowest since 2007. The Treasury 10-year yield fell to about 1.64%, the lowest level since October 2016.
The narrowing spread is a clear signal of increasing worries the U.S.-China trade fight will go on and sap the global economy in the process. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said Sunday they don't see a resolution before the 2020 election.
China was struggling with continuing protests in Hong Kong that included forcing a shutdown of its international airport. Speculation mounted that the Beijing government might bring in armed forces to control the situation.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was the only Dow stock showing a daily gain, up just 0.05%. Stocks of companies with global presences were weighing heavily on the market. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was down 2.6%.   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) was down 2.2% and   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) fell 3.7% after hitting a 52-week low.
Financial, consumer discretionary, materials and technology stocks were the weakest sectors. Real estate and utilities suffered the least losses. 
Big tech stocks fell, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), though Apple was off just 0.25%. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 5%, despite two Wall Street houses boosting their target prices on the stock. Some of the decline may be due to a huge run-up this year.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and   Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT) fell 7% and 5%, respectively, on concerns about when -- or if -- the ride-sharing companies will ever see profits.
The losses for the major averages were their seventh in the last 10 trading days. And volatility has increased, with the Dow off more than 280 points on four different days, including a dive of 767 points on Aug. 5.
It's not clear if the market is bottoming or could move lower. The Dow and S&P 500 saw their relative strength indexes drop under 30 on Aug. 5. The Nasdaq finished at 30 that day. A reading under 30 for an RSI, a measure of momentum, is a signal a stock or index is bottoming. The RSIs for the three indexes were above 30 on Monday but well off Friday levels.
This new round of volatility, the second this year, was set off when President Donald Trump announced last month the United States will raise tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods. 
In addition, the president has been pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates aggressively to counteract moves by other central banks. The Fed, which cut its key federal funds rate on July 31, is expected to cut rates again in mid-September. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool puts the odds at 77% the central bankers will cut their federal funds rate to 1.75% to 2% from 2% to 2.25% now.
The uncertainty has put the U.S. stock market firmly under control of computerized trading and made stock picking difficult. 
Winners and Losers Among S&P 500 Stocks
Biopharma giant Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), telecommunications company   CenturyLink   (NYSE:CTL) and food-distribution giant Sysco (NYSE:SYY) were among the top S&P 500 stocks. 
Drug-maker   Nektar Therapeutics   (NASDAQ:NKTR), fertilizer maker Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) and   Corteva   (NYSE:CTVA) were among the weakest S&P performers. Corteva is the seed-and-farm products company recently spun out of DowDuPont.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Monday she has asked the new head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to assess the agency's performance in the wake of two fatal crashes of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX planes since October.
Chao, who administered the oath of office to new FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) executive, at an event in Washington, said Dickson's arrival ""is an important opportunity to take stock of how well the FAA is doing in carrying out its critical safety functions."" 
She added that she has asked Dickson ""to assess the performance of the agency and the results of the ongoing investigations to make recommendations about any needed reforms.""
Dickson reiterated the position of his predecessor, Dan Elwell, who has been the acting FAA chief since January 2018, that the Boeing 737 MAX ""will not fly in commercial service until I am completely satisfied that it is safe to do so. FAA is following no timeline in returning the aircraft to service. Rather we are going to where the facts lead us.""
Major U.S. airlines have canceled flights into November as a result of the MAX grounding. Boeing said last month it plans to conduct a certification test flight in the ""September time frame."" Some officials do not expect the 737 MAX to actually resume flights until early 2020.
Federal prosecutors, the Department of Transportation’s inspector general, Congress and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating how the FAA certifies new aircraft. Last month, U.S. National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt said his agency would outline recommendations on the FAA’s aircraft certification procedures by late September.

Elwell will remain as deputy FAA administrator.

Federal Court Judge Nye Perram ordered the regulator to pay costs after finding that the bank did assess applicants' expenditure before approving home loans.
""I reject this case on the facts,"" Perram said in a published judgement. ""Westpac did have regard to these declared living expenses.""
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has been trying to introduce more prescriptive lending rules following revelations of improper lending.
ASIC had alleged that Westpac, Australia's oldest bank, had breached laws on up to 262,000 home loans by using an automated process to determine expenses rather that assessing each person's living costs.
The judgement comes after the parties had already agreed to a A$35 million ($23.6 million) settlement, which was rejected by the court.
Spokesmen for the bank and the regulator were not immediately available for comment."

(Reuters) - Meat processor Smithfield Foods Inc on Monday launched a line of soy-based meat products, joining an increasing number of companies catering to growing demand for meat alternatives.
The Pure Farmland products include soy-based burgers, meat balls, sausages and ground meat, and will be available at  Kroger Co  (N:KR), Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (O:SFM) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT) starting next week, the company said in a statement.
By February 2020, the brand will be available at over 5,000 retail stores, John Pauley, Smithfield's chief commercial officer, said in an interview.
The Virginia-based company, owned by China's WH Group Ltd (HK:0288) plans to branch out to the food services sector, he said, declining to provide further details.
Smithfield's production and supply chain infrastructure, and marketing and distribution network give it an edge over its rivals, Pauley added. ""We're not the new guy, we've been around for a long time.""
Established meat producers and upstarts are entering the market as consumers add more plant-based protein to their diet amid growing concerns about animal welfare, health risks from eating meat, and the environmental hazards of intensive animal farming.
Companies such as Beyond Meat (O:BYND) and Impossible Foods, and meat producers including  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN),  Maple Leaf Foods Inc  (TO:MFI) and Perdue Farms are selling sausages, burgers and imitation ground beef largely made from pea protein or soy."

Flights on the route between Brazil's two largest cities came up for grabs after the No. 4 airline Avianca Brasil ceased operating in May after filing for bankruptcy.
LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM) and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4), which already operate the lion's share of the more than 100 daily flights on the route, had in recent months spent millions of dollars to try to further increase their shares.
But Brazil's antitrust regulator in June issued a report raising concerns about market concentration in the domestic airline industry. The civil aviation regulator, ANAC, also said it would take back Avianca Brasil's landing and departure rights in Sao Paulo's airport as part of a plan to redistribute them later.
Azul will begin to operate the flights on Aug. 29, the company said in a securities filing."
366,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 05:38PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Inflation on Watch as Analysts Say Rate Cuts Coming 
Market participants look ahead to the release of consumer inflation data due Tuesday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). 
Economists forecast overall inflation measured by the consumer price index in July rose 0.3% from 0.1% the prior month, while the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have risen 0.2% from a 0.3% gain in June.
That would bring year-over-year core CPI growth to 3.2% and core CPI growth unchanged at 2.1%.
The Federal Reserve pointed to the subdued pace of consumer inflation as one of the key reasons for its rate cut last month, and further evidence of sluggish prices will strengthen calls for more aggressive rate cuts. 
UBS said it expected the Fed to deliver two further cuts, in September and in December this year, with another cut in March 2020, reducing rates to a range of 1% to 1.25%, well below the Fed's recent outlook on the longer-run fed funds rate of 2.5%
Expectations for rate cuts as well as weakening global growth saw the Treasury curve flatten further on Monday, with the spread between the yields on the 10-year and 2-year Treasuries narrowing to levels not seen since 2007.
2. API Crude Inventories, OPEC Monthly Report in Spotlight 
Following the Energy Information Administration's report last week of an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles, investors will look to the American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data for further insight into domestic crude supplies. 
The report will arrive ahead of OPEC's monthly report, with investors keen to get a sense of the oil cartel's outlook on world demand and supply.
The monthly report comes at a time when many fear a slowdown in the global economy could dent oil demand and pressure crude prices further. West Texas Intermediate crude is off about 17% from its late April peak of $66.30.
Crude oil prices, however, shrugged off fears of a slowdown in global growth on Monday, settling at $54.93 a barrel, up 0.8%, supported by reports that OPEC, in particular Saudi Arabia, is eyeing further production cuts. 
3. JD.com, Tilray Earnings on Deck
JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) reports second-quarter earnings on Tuesday before the opening bell, with shares up about 29% so far this year. 
The company's efforts to increase its e-commerce footprint in emerging markets is expected to continue underpin top-line growth. 
The company previously guided second-quarter revenue in the range of RMB145 billion and RMB150 billion, representing growth of 19% to 23% year on year.
JD.com is expected to report earnings per share of RMB0.46 on RMB147.56 billion of revenue, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), meanwhile, kicks off earnings for marijuana stocks after the closing bell. 
Like some of its peers, Tilray's earnings have been characterized by surging revenue, but widening losses as the marijuana company continues to invest in expanding its production and manufacturing operations in Canada and Portugal. 
The marijuana producer's acquisition of Manitoba Harvest in February earlier is expected to boost recreational cannabis sales and hemp food sales. 
Tilray, down 40% for the year, is expected to report a loss of 26 cents a share on revenue of $40.35 million. "

Gibbs, 55, has been with the company since 1989, holding several senior roles including chief financial officer for three years before taking charge as chief operating officer earlier this year.
Creed, who has been with Yum for 25 years, will remain as CEO through the end of 2019. He will serve as a part-time adviser next year and also remain on the company's board.
The 62-year-old has held the CEO role since 2015 and executed the 2016 spinoff of Yum China. The company's stock has more than doubled since Creed took the helm.
Yum, which has over 48,000 Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC restaurants across the globe, is among several restaurant chains facing a tough and competitive market.
Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum bought a stake in food-ordering company GrubHub (N:GRUB) early last year to improve its delivery services, a priority for today's customers.
Gibbs, who will assume the new role on Jan. 1, served as a chief strategy officer during which he revamped Yum's global restaurant operations model. He was also the CEO of the global Pizza Hut division."
370,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 04:49PM ET</span>",Empty Storefronts Jolt NYC Council Into Action on Small Business,"(Bloomberg) -- In New York City, big businesses like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are adding space. It’s the small ones local politicians are worried about, with vacant storefronts taking up as much as 20% of some retail areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn.
The City Council passed a law last month requiring landlords to register the status of their retail space, with updates when businesses come and go. The council said it enacted the law after having seen “a slew of beloved local establishments across the city closed amid skyrocketing costs.”
“We see property owners waiting on their vacant spaces to see how much they can get,” said Shrima Pandey, small business program manager for Chhaya Community Development Corp., which works with South Asians in the Queens borough.
Beyond a neighborhood’s need for lively street life, a retail downturn could reverse a decade’s economic gains. The industry is one of the city’s major employment generators, particularly for immigrants, accounting for 357,000 jobs, increasing more than 2% in the 12 months ending in June, according to the state Labor Department. Restaurants and bars had the most growth, followed by clothing stores, according to brokerage company Cushman & Wakefield.
“The city’s retail universe isn’t shrinking. It’s expanding into new neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens with retail corridors that didn’t exist 10 years ago,” said Jamie McShane, spokesman for the Real Estate Board of New York. “Yes there are changes -- part of a national phenomenon that has brought dislocation as people’s tastes and habits change.”
Rates Vary
Just last week, a city Planning Department report questioned whether the closing of mom-and-pop stores is as widespread as council members fear. It found a 5% vacancy rate in Pandey’s Jackson Heights, Queens, the lowest of 24 neighborhoods studied. Still, it found vacancy rates as high as 20% on Manhattan’s West 14th Street and in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant.
“Although the study did identify neighborhoods challenged by high vacancy rates, this condition was not universal,” the planning department said in the report. “Vacancy is concentrated only in certain neighborhoods and is influence by local and citywide market forces and spending patterns.”
Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer said the storefront-database law will “provide us with a greater understanding of how and where vacancies change year over year, and a method to track the effectiveness of any government assistance programs or policy changes aimed towards solving this issue.”
Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, who sponsored the bill, said her office conducted a 2017 survey of the Upper West Side and found a 14% vacancy rate on Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, close to the planning department’s estimate.
City Council researchers reported that average Manhattan rents rose 44%, to $156 per square foot, between 2006 and 2016. In Brooklyn, retail rents averaged at least $100 per square foot in 15 neighborhoods as of 2017, up from three in 2007, according to CPEX, a commercial real estate company.
Reverse Seen
Steven Soutendijk, executive managing director at Cushman & Wakefield, said that trend has reversed. Rents last year decreased 26% on Manhattan’s Madison Avenue and 11% on the Upper West Side, he said, citing Cushman data.
“Landlords still have to pay for maintenance, property tax, the mortgage,” Soutendijk said. “There’s almost no reason why any owner would want a space without income.”
Yet at 94th Street and Broadway on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, 4,000 square feet have gone unrented since its last tenant, Blockbuster Video, went bankrupt in 2010. Doug Kleiman of RIPCO Real Estate, which handles the property, declined to discuss it.
Meanwhile, at Sweetgreen, a fast-food salad chain, a steady stream of customers lined up at the counter. On the other side of Broadway at Gotham Wine and Liquors, longtime manager Charles Serra said business, too, has been good in his 30 years at the shop.

The 30-year yield tumbled as much as 14 basis points to 2.1179%, below the level it reached last Wednesday. The record stands for the long bond at 2.0882%, which the market touched back in July 2016. Yields on benchmark 10-year notes also dropped as much as 12 basis points to 1.6284%, and the key rate at one stage fell to be to just 5.1 basis points more than the equivalent for 2-year notes -- the smallest differential for the so-called yield curve since 2007.
The rush-for-cover came as global trade concerns rumbled on and as protests in Hong Kong forced airport authorities to cancel Monday’s remaining flights, escalating tensions with mainland China. Political upheaval in Argentina added to the risk aversion as assets in the country plunged in the wake of President Mauricio Macri’s unexpected defeat in a primary vote.
“The general risk-off theme is driving the move, which is actually flattening the curve rather than steepening it,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, a senior U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities. “This suggests that the market is being driven less by Federal Reserve expectations and more by a flight to quality or global uncertainty.”
The rush to havens spread across assets, with the Japanese yen nearing a 2019 high against the dollar while gold prices rallied. Fed funds futures showed traders betting on more easing from the U.S. central bank, with around 66 basis points of cuts priced in for the rest of this year.
“There’s a lot of concern that negative rates are going to move onto U.S. shores, and that’s driving demand for duration from fixed-income investors who are looking to insulate themselves,” said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer for Penn Mutual Asset Management, which has $27 billion under management.

Huawei Technologies Co. hired the law firm Sidley Austin LLP to lobby on trade as the U.S. pressures allies to join it in blacklisting the Chinese telecom giant and the company finds itself increasingly mired in President Donald Trump’s trade war with Beijing.
The lobbying, which began in July, will focus on export controls, trade sanctions “and other national security-related topics,” according to a disclosure filed with the U.S. Senate. The document shows that Huawei is deepening its ties to Sidley Austin, which is already working on the company’s legal challenges in the U.S., while also ramping up its lobbying presence.
Huawei, which is under an existential threat after the Trump administration blocked it from buying American technology over national-security concerns, has been drawn into the latest escalation of the trade war.
Only six weeks ago, following a meeting in Japan with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said he’d delay imposing some restrictions on U.S. companies’ sales to Huawei. The U.S. even invited companies to apply for licenses under an exemption to the Huawei ban.
But Bloomberg reported on Aug. 8 that the White House was holding off any decisions on those licenses. The delay follows a series of rapid-fire, tit-for-tat moves including Trump announcing plans to impose tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports in September and China halting purchases of U.S farm goods. The U.S. also declared China a currency manipulator.
Deepens Ties
Sidley Austin is already defending Huawei and a U.S. affiliate against charges that they defrauded at least four banks by concealing business dealings in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.
U.S. prosecutors are seeking to disqualify the company’s lead lawyer in the case, James Cole, because they say his former role as the No. 2 at the Justice Department gave him access to classified information that represents an “obvious conflict of interest.” A hearing has been scheduled in the matter in September.
Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of its billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei, is also charged in the case. She remains free on bail in Vancouver while she fights extradition to the U.S.
Sidley is also representing Huawei in a suit against the U.S. over seizure of telecommunications equipment during an investigation into whether the gear required export licenses. Neither Cole nor the lawyers listed in that lawsuit are among the lobbyists on the disclosure.
The Chinese company is one of the world’s biggest purchasers of semiconductors. Continuing those sales is crucial to the fortunes of chipmakers such as  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc., who sent their chief executives to meet with Trump in July.
Huawei has seen a dramatic slowdown in sales growth as it deals with the U.S. campaign.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google stopped providing Huawei with a version of its Android operating system, which lets apps run and provides mobile security on smartphones. That means Huawei, the world’s second-biggest smartphone seller, can no longer pre-install Google’s popular apps, like Gmail and YouTube, on Huawei devices.
To fight back, Huawei last week unveiled an in-house operating system, called HarmonyOS, saying it can replace Android if Google’s software is barred from its future smartphones. But Ren also said the company needed a lot more time to build an apps ecosystem, a requirement for any operating software to thrive in the long run.
American Onslaught
Huawei, which the U.S. says poses a risk because it must cooperate with Beijing’s espionage agencies under Chinese law, is kicking off a yearslong overhaul to create an “iron army” that can help it survive an American onslaught while protecting its lead in next-generation wireless, Ren warned in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News.
The U.S. says Huawei can build backdoors into its equipment and that it has stolen other companies’ intellectual property. The Shenzhen-based company counters that governments and customers in 170 countries use its equipment, which poses no greater cybersecurity threat than that of any communications technology vendor. Huawei says that the campaign results from Washington’s realization that the U.S. has fallen behind in developing fifth-generation mobile networks.
Huawei, which had all but shut down its Washington lobbying operation at the end of 2018, has also recently hired the law firms of Steptoe & Johnson LLP and Jones Day as lobbyists. After Samir Jain, a Jones Day partner who served on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council, registered to lobby for the company, Trump criticized the move in a tweet. The company says Jain will help with legal efforts and not lobby.
Sidley Austin also represents the U.S. division of Chinese video surveillance company Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co.,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and organizations with ties to the governments of Hong Kong and Russia, according to disclosures. It also represents Bloomberg LP, the owner of Bloomberg News."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped in a broad sell-off on Monday as simmering geopolitical tensions spooked equity investors and drove a bond market rally while the protracted U.S.-China trade war stoked fears of impending recession.
All three major U.S. stock indexes closed sharply lower in light trading, with little to soothe market jitters over Hong Kong protests, Argentine President Mauricio Macri's primary election defeat, and the U.S.-China tariff dispute that has rattled markets for months.

 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) said on Sunday that its economists see recessionary risks increasing as the U.S.-China trade war drags on.
""What investors are coming to realize is that the goings on outside U.S. borders is having an impact on global as well as U.S. economic growth,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""Investors are coming around to the fact that no matter where interest rates get pegged it will not mitigate the trade issues.""

VIENNA (Reuters) - Osram (DE:OSRn) said on Monday it would consider a takeover by Austrian sensor maker AMS (S:AMS) that trumps a competing bid by Bain and Carlyle (O:CG) with a cash offer valuing the German lighting group at 4.3 billion euros ($4.8 billion).
AMS said it could create a global heavyweight in sensors and photonics with the acquisition of Osram, a leader in automotive lighting technology whose share price has been depressed by profit warnings, doubts over its strategy and a weak car market.
Osram called AMS's financing plan ""binding and viable"". It added that a stable environment for its high-tech transformation was important, as well as the protection of company employees.
The offer would beat Bain Capital and Carlyle's 4 billion-euro bid that had been recommended by Osram's boards but slammed as too low by its biggest shareholder Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors.
AMS is keen to diversify into sensors for self-driving cars as it works to reduce its dependence on Apple (O:AAPL), which analysts estimate accounts for around 40% of revenue.
""The transaction is strategically compelling as it creates the global leader in sensor solutions and photonics for consumer as well as automotive, industrial and medical applications,"" said AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke.
""Together we will command the broadest portfolio of optical sensing and photonics in the industry,"" he said on a conference call on Monday.
Osram's shares jumped by as much as 12% earlier in the day, briefly surpassing Bain and Carlyle's offer of 35 euros a share but remaining below AMS's offer of 38.50 euros. They closed up 10.4% at 34.95 euros.
Shares in Swiss-listed AMS fell 11.8%, with Vontobel analysts saying the transaction would raise AMS's risk profile and value creation would be highly dependent on synergies, which AMS expects to exceed 300 million euros a year.
AMS's planned bid is backed by a 4.2 billion-euro bridge loan facility underwritten by UBS (S:UBSG) and HSBC (L:HSBA), which AMS plans to refinance by issuing debt and equity, including raising 1.5 billion euros of new equity.
A spokesman for Bain and Carlyle declined to comment.
INVESTOR UNEASE
AMS previously showed interest in Osram in June, signing a confidentiality agreement in order to gain access for due diligence. That included a clause under which AMS would not make another takeover attempt on Osram within 12 months. Back then, AMS did not make an offer, backpedaling within days as it did not have sufficient financing.
With financing now in place, AMS has given Osram until Aug. 15 to waive the standstill agreement and said it would then make a formal bid. Osram said that it would waive the agreement if negotiations were successful.
Analysts have previously questioned the logic of AMS's interest in Osram, saying it would have to carve out or sell Osram's non-semiconductor operations for a deal to make sense.
They also have voiced concern about the Austrian group's debt and the difficulty of diversifying from Apple amid fierce competition, global trade tensions and rapid technological developments.
Investors' unease is reflected in AMS' share price, which is 30% lower than a year ago.
The influential IG Metall union, which had welcomed the Bain and Carlyle offer, criticized AMS for its on-and-off approach, saying it hurt the sensor maker's credibility.
SENSORS FOR CARS
AMS aims to overcome those concerns by beefing up its auto business. It already develops sensors that can help map roads and control gear shifters and chassis in autonomous vehicles. It said a year ago it was engaging with ""a global pioneer in autonomous driving platforms"", and has repeatedly stressed that interest from the sector was rising.
Osram applies LEDs and laser chips to lock and unlock cars. It took a stake in Recogni, a Silicon Valley start-up that specializes in artificial intelligence for driverless cars earlier this month.
AMS aims to increase the automotive business's revenue share to 35-40% if the total from 10% currently if it acquires Osram.
To streamline production and avoid overcapacity, the Austrian group plans to shift Osram's LED production from Asia to Germany's Regensburg. That does not necessarily imply that Osram's billion-dollar factory in Malaysia's Kulim will be shut down, an AMS spokeswoman said. AMS would rather see whether it can use the facility for other products.
The Austrian company said it would gradually phase out the consumer general lighting LED business, which the Kulim factory was built to service.
AMS said it sees Osram's digital division - part of Osram's attempt to become a high-tech group - as non-core, adding that it would seek ""the best owner"" for the division."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on Monday, in line with the weak stock market, as trade worries and global political tensions in places such as Hong Kong and Argentina supported safe-haven assets.
U.S. 30-year bond yields slid to their lowest since July 2016. U.S. long-term yields have fallen in six of the past nine sessions, reflecting investors' diminished risk appetite.
European bond yields were also lower on the day.
The U.S. yield curve has also flattened significantly, suggesting mounting anxiety. The yield spread between U.S. 2-year and 10-year notes, a closely watched metric, narrowed to 5.3 basis points, the smallest difference since at least 2010, according to Refinitiv data.
The bond rally was triggered by protests in Hong Kong over the weekend, which originally stemmed from opposition to a bill allowing extradition to the mainland. That crippled Hong Kong's airport, while in Argentina the defeat of President Mauricio Macri during primary elections added to global stress.
""The Hong Kong demonstrations and their ability to shut down the airport and the surprise in Argentina took the wind out of the sails of the stock market,"" said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.
""We're back to worrying that things are still unsettled and so there's no need to push stocks higher, and without that optimism, without that 'things-are-getting-better' impulse behind stocks, Treasury yields are moving to the lower middle of the range,"" he added.
Italy also had political problems after the League party last week filed a no-confidence motion against its own governing coalition. The party's populist chief Matteo Salvini hopes that the motion move will trigger early elections and have him installed as the new leader.
Concern about the U.S.-China trade conflict persisted. A week ago, China allowed the yuan to break through the key 7-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008, prompting Washington to label Beijing a currency manipulator and sparking market turmoil.
Analysts also said Monday's bond rally was exaggerated by a slew of holidays in Asia, particularly Japan, Singapore and India.
In afternoon trading, U.S. benchmark 10-year note yields fell to 1.64% (US10YT=RR), from 1.734% late on Friday.
Since the beginning of the year, 10-year yields have fallen more than a hundred basis points, on track for its steepest drop in eight years.
Yields on 30-year bonds slid to 2.13% (US30YT=RR), from 2.247% on Friday. Earlier, they fell to a more than three-year low of 2.119%.
At the short end of the curve, two-year yields slipped to 1.581%, from Friday's 1.63% (US2YT=RR).

RBC, part of Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY), said it had suspended Tsai and has a ""zero-tolerance approach to any breach of the law or our code of conduct."" It was not accused of wrongdoing.
Tsai was accused of buying Electronics for Imaging call options after learning it was negotiating a takeover by private equity firm Siris Capital Group LLC, an RBC client.
According to a criminal complaint, Tsai began purchasing the options on March 29, using a personal trading account he had concealed from RBC, and sold them less than two hours after the $1.6 billion merger was announced on April 15.
Electronics for Imaging's share price rose 29.3% that day, and prosecutors said Tsai generated a $98,750 profit on his options, for which he had paid $28,410.
""His profits were not the result of trading acumen, diligent research, or blind luck,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said in a statement.
Call options give purchasers the right to buy stock at a specific price in the future, in exchange for fees paid to the sellers, and are bets that the stock price will rise. Siris completed its purchase of Electronics for Imaging last month.
The cases are U.S. v. Tsai, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-mag-07464; and SEC v Tsai in the same court, No. 19-07501."

HAVANA (Reuters) - A European subsidiary of British beverage giant  Diageo  Plc (L:DGE) signed a joint venture deal with state-run Cuba Ron SA on Monday to market Santiago de Cuba Rum, in defiance of U.S. efforts to dissuade investment in the Communist-run country. 
The new 50-50 venture, Ron Santiago SA, will have exclusive international rights to the premium brand, considered the best by local residents along with Havana Club, which is marketed by French firm  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) under a similar arrangement signed in the 1990s. 
The agreement comes at a time when the United States is ramping up sanctions on Cuba and trying to thwart foreign investment there. 
The Trump administration in May allowed Title III of the 1996 Helms Burton Act to take effect, enabling U.S. citizens to bring lawsuits against foreign companies profiting from property taken from them after Cuba’s 1959 revolution. It had been suspended by President Donald Trump’s predecessors. 
The Santiago distillery and related properties were reportedly nationalized. 
Cuban rum is banned in the United States, but popular throughout Europe and other parts of the world.
""Cuban rum represents 9 percent of retail sales of premium rum worldwide,"" a news release from the new company said.
Regarding the implementation of the long-dormant section of the Helms-Burton Act, Luca Cesarano, general director of the new joint venture, said he was confident the company would not be affected.
Cesarano said a subsidiary of Diageo with no ties to the United States was the partner and no company personnel who work with or in the United States were involved in the project or would be in the future. 

""Neither the subsidiary of Diageo which is the partner, nor the venture, will interact with any Diageo entity or person that interacts with the United States,"" he said at a Havana news conference.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said on Monday it had reached a settlement with ITT Educational Services Inc over predatory lending practices, but does not plan to collect any of a $60 million judgment from the bankrupt for-profit college.
The proposed settlement stipulates that the bureau will not seek any funds through bankruptcy proceedings from ITT, citing the limited amount available to be distributed to former students. The settlement, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of Indiana also bars ITT, which filed for bankruptcy in September 2016, from providing student loans in the future.
The CFPB had sued ITT in 2014, alleging it engaged in predatory lending practices, pushing student borrowers into high-cost private loans that they did not understand and could not afford. ITT closed roughly 130 campuses as it filed for bankruptcy, amid growing government scrutiny of for-profit colleges.
In June, the government announced ITT's affiliated lender, Student CU Connect CUSO, would stop collecting on $168 million in outstanding student loans."

388,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 01:11PM ET</span>",Markets bracing for volatility after Argentine opposition upsets Macri in primary,"By Cassandra Garrison and Hugh Bronstein
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's peso currency collapsed on Monday while stocks and bonds crashed by a degree not seen in 18 years as voters flirted with a return to interventionist economics by snubbing market-friendly President Mauricio Macri for the opposition in Sunday's primary vote. 
The peso initially dropped 30.3% to a record low of 65 per U.S. dollar on Monday, but partially recovered later in the day to 55 per U.S. dollar, traders said, after opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez - whose running mate is former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner - dominated the primary by a much wider-than-expected 15.5 percentage point margin. 
Fernandez has said he would seek to ""rework"" Argentina's $57-billion standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund if he won October's general election.
Argentine stocks were among the top losers on the Nasdaq and the local Merval stock index was down 31%. Falls of between 18-20 cents in Argentina's benchmark 10-year bonds left them trading at around 60 cents on the dollar or even lower. 
Refinitiv data showed that Argentine stocks, bonds and the peso had not recorded this kind of simultaneous fall since the South American country's 2001 economic crisis and debt default. 
The comprehensive victory by Peronists Fernandez and Kirchner ""paves the way for the return to left-wing populism that many investors fear,"" consultancy Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
""With a renewed focus on sovereign default risks, bonds, equities and the peso will come under severe pressure in the coming days. That said, falls in the currency might be tempered by intervention in the foreign exchange market,"" it said.
Argentina's central bank intervened hours after local markets opened, selling $50 million in the foreign exchange market to defend the peso in the face of the massive sell-off. The auction used the bank's own reserves for the first time since September of last year, traders said. The bank later said it would auction another $50 million of reserves.
Dollar auctions by the bank over recent months had been carried out using funds from the treasury.
According to Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, for global trading purposes the peso market does not have a measurable impact. He does not expect an emerging markets-wide contagion from the peso's demise.
""It's a very small market,"" Thin said. ""Ever since Macri reopened the markets, took some market-friendly measures, there’s been a trickle of activity back in the peso and Argentine assets in general. Money has been trickling back in but it is still very minimal.""
Thin added that ""beyond Brazil and maybe Uruguay, it's going to have a very limited impact from an economic standpoint."" 
MACRI STRUGGLES 
Macri, a scion of one of Argentina's wealthiest families, came to power in 2015 on promises to kick-start Latin America's third-largest economy via a liberalization wave. 
But the promised recovery has not materialized and Argentina is in recession with inflation at over 55%.
An acute financial crisis last year hit the peso and forced Macri to take the IMF loan in return for pledging to balance Argentina's deficit. 
Despite Macri's struggles, investors see the Fernandez ticket as a riskier prospect due to the opposition's previous interventionist policies.
Sunday's result indicated that Fernandez had enough support to clinch the presidency in October's first round, without having to go to a November run-off election.
A candidate needs at least 45% of the vote, or 40% and a difference of 10 percentage points over the second-place runner, in order to win the presidency outright. 
Argentina's main political parties had already chosen their presidential nominees, allowing the primary to serve as a first concrete measure of voter sentiment.
Edward Glossop, Latin America economist for Capital Economics, predicted higher inflation in a country that has fought against chronic rising prices for decades. 
""We will probably see inflation rising, assuming the peso doesn't recoup some of those loses,"" said Edward Glossop, Latin America economist for Capital Economics.
""The key point there is that high inflation means the peso will need to continue to weaken to maintain its competitiveness,"" Glossop added. He said it was ""completely feasible"" for the peso to drop to as low as 70 per U.S. dollar.
Fernandez said the market reactions were in response to Macri's failures on the economy.
""Markets react badly when they realize they were scammed. We are living a fictitious economy and the government is not giving answers,"" Fernandez said in a radio interview Monday morning. 
Voters were given a stark choice to stay the course of painful austerity measures under Macri or return to economic policies that are heavy on state involvement.
Kirchner imposed strict currency controls that slammed investment during her 2007-2015 administration. She fought with the farm sector over export taxes and presided over a multi-year standoff with bondholders that kept Argentina locked out of the international capital markets. 
""I would say they (bonds) are pricing in a much higher probability of a default,"" said Aberdeen Standard EM portfolio manager Viktor Szabo. 
Szabo did add however that they were still above the 40 cents level that would truly reflect a fully fledged default. 
Fernandez prevailed on Sunday in the majority of the country's provinces, but one of the starker differences was seen in the poor suburbs of Buenos Aires. 
What particularly dented Macri's support were newly impoverished Argentines who were more energized to vote to punish him at the polls, political analysts said.
(Graphic: Argentina primary election link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2MWp6jj).
Analysts predicted Sunday's results could be the final nail in the coffin for Macri.
""Macri has already implemented a number of short term measures to try and shore up support ahead of the October vote. Additional promises can be made, but the gap he needs to make up is a very wide one,"" said Ilya Gofshteyn, senior emerging markets strategist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank.
Right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro warned that his country could see a wave of migrants fleeing Argentina if Fernandez wins the presidential election.

Bologna has cast himself as foe to the left-wing leaders around Latin America and celebrated his friendship with Macri.

389,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 01:08PM ET</span>","Tyson to rebuild plant after fire, assures weekly pay for full-time workers","By Uday Sampath Kumar and Tom Polansek
(Reuters) - U.S. meat processor  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) said on Monday it will rebuild a Kansas beef plant after a fire heavily damaged the facility last week and that full-time, active employees would be paid weekly until production resumes. 
The company said the plant would be down ""indefinitely"" after the Friday night fire, which idled some 3,800 workers.
Tyson's stock price recovered from an early drop and was trading near unchanged around midday, after setting a record high on Friday. The stock has climbed more than 60% this year, partly on strong demand for beef, the largest segment of Tyson's business by sales. 
The company plans to rebuild the damaged beef plant in Holcomb, Kansas, but said it did not know when the facility would reopen.
""We will use other plants within our network to help keep our supply chain full,"" said Steve Stouffer, group president of Tyson Fresh Meats.
There were no casualties reported due to the fire, the cause of which was still being investigated.
The plant processed about 6,000 cattle per day, representing around 5% of the total industry and a bit over 20% of Tyson's capacity, J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said. He estimated the plant will be shut for months and that the closure could hurt Tyson's fiscal 2019 earnings per share by as much as 50 cents. 
The halt in slaughtering pushed Chicago Mercantile Exchange cattle futures down by their daily, exchange-imposed 3-cent limit as traders expect cattle supplies may start to back up in feedlots. October cattle futures were down 3 cents at 103.750 cents per pound
Lower cattle prices could benefit other meat companies, which will see a larger supply while Tyson's plant is closed, said Dennis Smith, broker for Archer Financial Services. Tyson competes with packers like Cargill and JBS USA.
""The packers are going to use the leverage to their full advantage, and they're going to lower the cash steer market,"" Smith said.
Tyson's beef business produced a record operating margin of 6.1% in the first nine months of its fiscal year, up from 5.8% a year earlier. The company projects margins will reach 7% for the full year and be similar or higher in 2020 as supplies of cattle are ample.

In the quarter ended June 29, the beef unit recorded sales of $4.2 billion. Sales volumes and prices rose from a year earlier.

394,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 12:49PM ET</span>",Apple supplier AMS makes 38.50 euros/share takeover offer for Germany's Osram,"By Kirsti Knolle
VIENNA (Reuters) - Osram (DE:OSRn) said on Monday it would consider a takeover by Austrian sensor maker AMS (S:AMS) that trumps a competing bid by Bain and Carlyle (O:CG) with a cash offer valuing the German lighting group at 4.3 billion euros ($4.8 billion).
AMS said it could create a global heavyweight in sensors and photonics with the acquisition of Osram, a leader in automotive lighting technology whose share price has been depressed by profit warnings, doubts over its strategy and a weak car market. 
Osram called AMS's financing plan ""binding and viable"". It added that a stable environment for its high-tech transformation was important, as well as the protection of company employees.
The offer would beat Bain Capital and Carlyle's 4 billion-euro bid that had been recommended by Osram's boards but slammed as too low by its biggest shareholder Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. 
AMS is keen to diversify into sensors for self-driving cars as it works to reduce its dependence on Apple (O:AAPL), which analysts estimate accounts for around 40% of revenue.
""The transaction is strategically compelling as it creates the global leader in sensor solutions and photonics for consumer as well as automotive, industrial and medical applications,"" said AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke.
""Together we will command the broadest portfolio of optical sensing and photonics in the industry,"" he said on a conference call on Monday.
Osram's shares jumped by as much as 12% earlier in the day, briefly surpassing Bain and Carlyle's offer of 35 euros a share but remaining below AMS's offer of 38.50 euros. They closed up 10.4% at 34.95 euros. 
Shares in Swiss-listed AMS fell 11.8%, with Vontobel analysts saying the transaction would raise AMS's risk profile and value creation would be highly dependent on synergies, which AMS expects to exceed 300 million euros a year. 
AMS's planned bid is backed by a 4.2 billion-euro bridge loan facility underwritten by UBS (S:UBSG) and HSBC (L:HSBA), which AMS plans to refinance by issuing debt and equity, including raising 1.5 billion euros of new equity.
A spokesman for Bain and Carlyle declined to comment. 
INVESTOR UNEASE
AMS previously showed interest in Osram in June, signing a confidentiality agreement in order to gain access for due diligence. That included a clause under which AMS would not make another takeover attempt on Osram within 12 months. Back then, AMS did not make an offer, backpedaling within days as it did not have sufficient financing. 
With financing now in place, AMS has given Osram until Aug. 15 to waive the standstill agreement and said it would then make a formal bid. Osram said that it would waive the agreement if negotiations were successful.
Analysts have previously questioned the logic of AMS's interest in Osram, saying it would have to carve out or sell Osram's non-semiconductor operations for a deal to make sense. 
They also have voiced concern about the Austrian group's debt and the difficulty of diversifying from Apple amid fierce competition, global trade tensions and rapid technological developments. 
Investors' unease is reflected in AMS' share price, which is 30% lower than a year ago.
The influential IG Metall union, which had welcomed the Bain and Carlyle offer, criticized AMS for its on-and-off approach, saying it hurt the sensor maker's credibility. 
SENSORS FOR CARS
AMS aims to overcome those concerns by beefing up its auto business. It already develops sensors that can help map roads and control gear shifters and chassis in autonomous vehicles. It said a year ago it was engaging with ""a global pioneer in autonomous driving platforms"", and has repeatedly stressed that interest from the sector was rising.
Osram applies LEDs and laser chips to lock and unlock cars. It took a stake in Recogni, a Silicon Valley start-up that specializes in artificial intelligence for driverless cars earlier this month. 
AMS aims to increase the automotive business's revenue share to 35-40% if the total from 10% currently if it acquires Osram. 
To streamline production and avoid overcapacity, the Austrian group plans to shift Osram's LED production from Asia to Germany's Regensburg. That does not necessarily imply that Osram's billion-dollar factory in Malaysia's Kulim will be shut down, an AMS spokeswoman said. AMS would rather see whether it can use the facility for other products.
The Austrian company said it would gradually phase out the consumer general lighting LED business, which the Kulim factory was built to service.

AMS said it sees Osram's digital division - part of Osram's attempt to become a high-tech group - as non-core, adding that it would seek ""the best owner"" for the division.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) on Monday named a new head of its activism defense group after the partner leading it left the investment bank to work for hedge fund Elliott Management.
The bank said Avinash Mehrotra will be the global head of Activism and Shareholder Advisory, returning to a position he is familiar with after having served as global co-head of the group between 2015 and 2017.
""As one of our most experienced M&A bankers dealing with contested situations, his leadership will be critical amidst the recent uptick in hostile M&A activity,"" Goldman's three co-heads of global mergers and acquisitions wrote in a memo seen by Reuters.
Bloomberg first reported the news earlier on Monday.
Mehrotra was tapped after Steven Barg resigned to join Elliott, one of the world's busiest activist hedge funds.
Mehrotra and Barg were appointed as global co-heads of activism defense in 2015 to replace William Anderson, who had moved to boutique investment bank Evercore Partners.

Mehrotra will work with Pete Michelsen, who heads the defense practice in the Americas, and Nimesh Khiroya, who heads the defense practice in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the memo said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - CBS Corp (N:CBS) and Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) are in the final stages of negotiating an all-stock merger that values Viacom at a discount to its closing price on Friday, two sources told Reuters.
Shares of CBS fell 0.2% to $48.81, while Viacom fell 3.2% to $29.03.
Viacom shareholders will receive just above 0.595 CBS shares for each share they own, the sources said, adding that the final terms could still change. One source said the range was between 0.5960 and 0.5965.
""It is smart on CBS's part not to pay any premium for Viacom as it does very little to help CBS,"" said Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners. ""Viacom stock already has premium priced in its stock.""
Bob Bakish, Chief Executive of Viacom, is expected to be named the Chief Executive of the combined company; Joe Ianniello, interim CEO of CBS, is expected to be named CEO and Chairman of CBS Networks, a source familiar with the matter said. Ianniello's purview would exclude Showtime and publisher Simon & Schuster.
The deal, which could be announced as early as Monday, will reunite CBS and Viacom, bringing together the CBS television networks, cable network Showtime, and book publisher Simon & Schuster with MTV networks, Nickelodeon and the Paramount movie studio.
Consumers should expect the combined company to build out its existing subscription and free streaming video businesses, such as CBS All Access and Viacom's Pluto TV, as it seeks to find its place in the rapidly consolidating media universe.
The two companies are controlled by National Amusements Inc, the holding company owned by billionaire Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari.
Sumner Redstone split the company in 2006, aiming to unlock the value of the once fast-growing cable networks business in Viacom from the cash generating television business in CBS, while resolving the management issue of who would take over the company.
But in an era of cord-cutting and the rise of subscription video services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), CBS and Viacom are now considered too small to compete against the likes of Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), which is launching a streaming video service later this year, AT&T Inc (N:T), which will also launch a new service by early next year, and bigger tech companies including Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).

This is CBS's third attempt since 2016 to bring the U.S. entertainment companies together. Previous merger talks had failed because of clashes between executives over divvying up top jobs and the companies' relative valuation.

MUMBAI/DUBAI (Reuters) - Creditors' hopes of resurrecting India's Jet Airways (NS:JET) and salvaging some value from the bankrupt airline were dealt a fresh blow on Monday as two potential investors said they were no longer interested in putting money into the business. 
The billionaire head of Vedanta, Anil Agarwal, whose family trust Volcan Investment had said it was looking at taking a stake in Jet, backed out on Monday. 
Etihad Airways, which already owns a minority stake in Jet, also said it was not interested in reinvesting in the airline.
The announcements are a setback for creditors hoping to recover a portion of the more than $3 billion that the airline owes to its lenders, lessors, staff and other suppliers. 
""The EOI (expression of interest) for Jet Airways by Volcan was exploratory in nature. On further evaluation and considering other priorities, we intend to not pursue this further,"" Volcan said in a brief statement, a day after it had disclosed it had submitted an EOI for the airline. 
The firm declined to provide any detail on its reasoning.
Separately, Abu Dhabi's Etihad said it was not interested in reinvesting in Jet because of unresolved issues concerning the Indian airline's liabilities.
""Etihad remained engaged in the process, but despite the endeavors of everyone involved there remained very significant issues relating to Jet’s previous liabilities,"" it said. 
Etihad acquired a 24% stake in Jet in 2013, at a time when the carrier had needed significant financial support.
A total of three EOIs have been received for Jet after prospective bidders were invited to express interest, according to media reports. 
With Volcan out, only two potential bidders likely remain in the fray. 
Resolution professionals are examining the EOIs and are likely to announce the names that make the cut on Aug. 13, according to a source familiar with the matter. The only criterion for bidders is having a net worth of 10 billion Indian rupees ($140 million).
Prior to entering the bankruptcy court, Jet's lenders had run a similar sale process that failed to attract any binding offers from bidders that met the cut-off criteria.
Some analysts are concerned the same problems are playing out again, further eroding any value left in Jet.
""Nothing has changed at all in the last few months, the Jet deal has been stuck in a limbo and we haven't moved forward. We are again back to the EOI stage and uncertainty remains,"" said an aviation analyst, requesting anonymity.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London met a second-quarter target to complete at least half of its insurance under-writing deals electronically, as part of efforts to modernize operations and save costs.
The specialist Lloyd's market insures everything from hurricane damage to soccer stars' legs, but has been buffeted by two years of steep losses due to natural catastrophes.
In May, Lloyd's, which relies heavily on face-to-face trading, said all participants would move to electronic exchanges next year, as the 330-year-old market responds to competition from cheaper rivals.
Data shows that while most business is still currently negotiated in person, a majority of the in-scope risk was confirmed, or 'bound', electronically. The goal is to ensure all business is submitted to the platform electronically as well.
In-scope risks represent the majority of the market and include property insurance and liability insurance. They exclude a small portion of specialist types of risk.
Lloyd's, which has 99 syndicate members comprising British and international insurers, accepted an average of 60.2% of in-scope risks electronically, trade body the London Market Group said in a statement. All Lloyd's members met the target, it said.
Insurance companies not in Lloyd's accepted an average of 51% of in-scope under-writing risks electronically, their trade body, The International Underwriting Association of London (IUA) said.
""These numbers are encouraging and demonstrate a market-wide commitment to modernize the way we do business at Lloyd’s,"" Lloyd’s Chief Executive John Neal said in a statement.
Feeling the pressure of rising competition, Lloyd's last year introduced targets to speed up automation. Its syndicate members face charges if they fail to comply.
""The next step is to build the same success in submissions as we have in risks bound, and our goal is to hit a target of 10% for submissions in Q4 of this year,"" said Bronek Masojada, chair of the board of Platform Placing Limited, the platform the insurers use to trade digitally."

(Reuters) -  Barrick Gold Corp  (TO:ABX) (N:GOLD) reported quarterly adjusted profit that nearly doubled on higher production on Monday, and said it has a ""great deal of work"" ahead resolving problems around its African unit, whose buyout the company expects to complete next month.
Barrick also said it plans to begin the sale process for its 50% stake in the Kalgoorlie operation in Western Australia in the third quarter. Newmont Goldcorp (N:NEM) owns the remainder.
The world's second-largest gold producer reported adjusted profit of $154 million, or 9 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, up from $81 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier.
Barrick expects 2019 gold production to be at the higher end of its 5.1 million to 5.6 million range, and all-in sustaining costs to be at the lower end of its $870 to $920 per ounce range.
Barrick's shares rose 2.1% to C24.47 in Toronto.
The Toronto-based company is in the process of integrating operations following a flurry of activity over the past few quarters, from the acquisition of  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) late last year to a joint venture in Nevada with the world's biggest gold producer, Newmont Goldcorp, to the buyout of Tanzania-focused unit Acacia Mining Plc (L:ACAA).
Chief Executive Mark Bristow, who led Randgold before taking over leadership of the combined company, said in Barrick's earnings statement that Acacia's operations had not been managed by previous Barrick management.
He said Barrick must work to ""get to grips"" with Acacia's operations, and sort out disputes the London-listed miner has faced in Tanzania.
In a separate statement on Monday, Acacia said the Tanzanian government had lifted a July suspension of gold shipments from its North Mara mine.
Barrick swung to a net profit of $194 million in the second quarter, or 11 cents a share, from a loss of $94 million, or 8 cents, a year earlier, driven by favorable tax adjustments and currency movements, the company said. Analysts had expected a profit of $199.6 million.
Gold output in the quarter jumped nearly 27% to 1.35 million ounces from a year ago, while copper rose about 17% to 97 million pounds.
Bloomberg reported last week that Barrick is seeking to sell its Tongon mine in Ivory Coast. The company is prepping the sale of its Lumwana mine in Zambia in the second half, Reuters reported in May.
Kalgoorlie, Tongon and Lumwana are not among the Tier 1 assets that Barrick has said it will focus on."

The Dow fell 203 points or 0.8% by 9:40 AM ET (13:40 GMT), while the S&P 500 lost 22 points or 0.8% and the Nasdaq composite was down 69 points or 0.9%.
Markets have struggled to maintain momentum since falling sharply after U.S. President Donald Trump ended a trade truce with China in early August. Trump said on Friday he was not ready to make a deal with China, after a string of tit-for-tat exchanges in the course of the week.
Still, at least some analysts expect the dip in equities to be short-lived. 
“We continue to believe that the current period of volatility will not have a longer duration than what we have seen during the May pullback,”JP Morgan global equity strategists said in a note. 
“Trade remains a wild-card, but we think a chance of a ceasefire into September, with a potential that the latest tariff threat is not implemented, should not be dismissed.”
Meanwhile tensions between Asian financial hub Hong Kong and China grew over the weekend, with more reports of violence erupting between protesters and police. 
Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) jumped 1.7% after it said it was on track to hit the higher end of its projected profit range this year, due in part to a 27% rise in gold production driven by strong performances at mines in Mali and Argentina.
ABB (NYSE:ABB) jumped 3.4% after it appointed Bjorn Rosengren as its CEO, while   Roku   (NASDAQ:ROKU) jumped 5.5% on an analyst upgrade after strong results last week.
Banks were lower amid fears that lower long-term interest rates will hit their profit margins, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),   Citigroup   Inc (NYSE:C) and   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) all falling over 2%. 
The FAANG group of stocks were also lower after the open, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) down 1%.

407,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 08:35AM ET</span>",Argentine Assets Tumble After Macri Routed in Shock Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s international bonds and stocks tumbled in London and New York early trading after a populist opposition candidate routed President Mauricio Macri in a shock primary election result.
The nation’s euro-denominated notes due in 2028 collapsed, sending the yield up almost three percentage points to 13.46%, the highest since the notes were sold in 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Dollar bonds due in 2048 plunged almost 17% in New York, while American depositary receipts from Argentine companies sank in early trading.
Opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez and his running mate, former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, won by a much wider-than-expected margin over Macri, spooking investors who were already trimming exposure to Argentine assets as the Oct. 27 presidential election nears.
Amherst Pierpont Securities warned of “panic” when local markets open. Others weighed the chances that the central bank will intervene to support the currency, which is already the worst-performer in emerging markets this year versus the dollar with a 17% loss.
“For markets, this is very negative,” said Carolina Gialdi, a senior fixed-income strategist at BTG in Buenos Aires. “The market will likely price this as it is a done deal that Alberto Fernandez won.”
The peso could lose 25% of its value and bonds may slump about 20% on the results, according to BTG Pactual Argentina. That would be a sharp turnaround from Friday, when bonds and locally traded shares gained amid optimism about Macri’s chances.
Traders fear the primaries are a signal the country may look to return to policies such as currency and capital controls, steering away from Macri’s more market-friendly positions.
In a press conference Sunday evening, Macri said he had “a bad election,” and that his coalition would work to change the trend. The president declined to say if he’ll announce special measures to calm markets or boost the country’s economy ahead of the first round vote.
Here’s what money managers and analysts are saying:
Siobhan Morden, head of fixed income strategy for Latin America at Amherst Pierpont Securities:
Markets will likely “panic” Monday, and bond prices could plummet as investors start to discount a high probability of default“The burden is now on Fernandez to calm markets or inherit a country that is ungovernable”Gene Frieda, a strategist at Pacific Investment Management Co. in London:
“The market will now need to factor in a substantially higher probability of negative debt dynamics, capital controls and some kind of forced debt reprofiling”“We see little reason for contagion to persist across the rest of EM, but in thin August markets, the risk of overshoots is magnified by thin liquidity”Julian Rimmer, a trader at Investec Bank Plc in London:
Volatility across the EMFX complex has been remarkably subdued of late but a crisis in Argentina could rekindle concerns in other frangible currencies like the Turkish lira and the South African rand, especially in light of seasonally low turnoverPer Hammarlund, the chief emerging-markets strategist at SEB AB in Stockholm:
“The effect on other EMs will be noticeable, but given that many EM investors have been cautious about adding exposure to Argentina, the effect should be temporary, lasting less than a month”More from BTG’s Gialdi:
The central bank will probably not intervene even if there’s a 30% drop in the currency because “it would be a massive waste of international reserves, which only makes things worse” and could put more pressure on the currencyWhitney Baker, founder of New York-based Totem Macro:
Baker has been bullish on Argentina since September and said more information is needed before she changes her stance, but that “it’s clearly more negative”Expects the central bank to be in the currency market if there’s substantial pressure“A severe market reaction could give the electorate a taste of what they’re in for if they elect the Peronist ticket, and we know they’re very clued into the currency. If there’s an outsized reaction they may think hey, this is actually us going backwards”James Barrineau, the New York-based head of emerging-market debt at  Schroders  (LON:SDR):
Peso is likely to get hurt but central bank has ability to support it; still, people don’t want to see a full week of a weaker peso and the central bank spending dollars to support it“I wouldn’t expect things to go out to 13, 14 or 15% yield in short-dated bonds because market was already cautious on election”“I wouldn’t expect the bottom to fall out here, but we’re going to clearly adjust for a higher probability of Fernandez winning if these results hold”(Updates with U.S. bonds, NY pre-trading starting in first paragraph.)"

(Reuters) -  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) will launch a new subscription service for kids sneakers this week that seeks to woo parents with an offer of fewer nightmarish trips to the shoe store in exchange for a regular fee and consistent brand loyalty.
Aimed at the U.S. kids shoe market, estimated at an annual $10 billion, ""Adventure Club"" builds on Nike's SNKRS app, which notifies shoppers every time it launches a new shoe or has an exclusive sneaker at a nearby store.
It is Nike's latest plan to keep shoppers coming back to its brands as it struggles with strong competition from Adidas (DE:ADSGN) in its U.S. home market and a resurgence in retro brands like Fila and Reebok.
With three tiers of subscription – $20, $30 or $50 a month – Nike Adventure Club is aimed at 2-year to 10-year olds and effectively gives subscribers a new pair of Nike sneakers that cost about $50 or more once a month, once every two months or once every three.
Depending on whether the kids pick, for example, Nike Air Max or Converse sneakers, members will save almost nothing or up to $50 on each pair.
""Solving the need for parents with kids aged 2-10 years means that we are going to start building relationships through kids,"" the scheme's manager for Nike, Dave Cobban, said.
The big challenge, he admitted, was helping parents get the right shoe for kids with constantly growing feet without trips to the mall or a series of mailed returns.
Nike's subscription box will include a sizing chart in the form of a fridge magnet to help parents measure their children's feet. The company said a pilot program with 10,000 members has shown that only a small proportion of parents get the size wrong.
""About 15% of the first order is generally not the right size. When the (customer) makes the first order and it's the wrong size, we allow (the customer) to immediately order a new shoe and the new shoe comes before you have to send back the old one,"" he said.
""The next time less than 5% make a mistake in ordering the right size on their second order and after that, it almost comes (down) to zero.""
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Macy's are already using the subscription model for beauty products to keep consumers interested in a market that is flooded by online specialty retailers and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)."

The company said Heath Canada's rating was based on observations made during an inspection completed between July 10 and July 16, and noted that five rooms, converted from operational areas, were used for storage since June 2018 without prior approval by the regulator.
The regulator also noted that two new areas were constructed without prior approval and that security controls as well as quality assurance investigations were inadequate at the facility, while operating procedures did not to meet requirements.
Documents and information were also not retained in a manner to enable Health Canada to complete its audit in a timely manner.
Last month, Health Canada placed on hold about 5,200 kilograms of dried cannabis harvested in five unlicensed rooms. CannTrust also put a voluntary hold on 7,500 kg of inventory made in the rooms.
CannTrust, which was notified of the non-compliance on Friday, said it had already begun investigating and remediating the root causes of any non-compliance and expects to propose a robust remediation plan to Health Canada."

Asia's biggest financial hub entered its tenth week of anti-government protests at the weekend, with renewed flashes of violence reported. 
Hong Kong's airport cancelled all flights halfway through the day as protesters thronged to it in response to a government instruction to airline Cathay Pacific, ordering it to bar any staff who took part in political demonstrations from the rosters of flights to the mainland. Violence also broke out between police and protesters in at least two large subway stations, the BBC reported.
Chinese officials said the violence must stop after clashes between protesters and police erupted throughout the city, stoking fears that it will deploy more force to restore order.
Nasdaq 100 futures fell 63 points or 0.8% by 6:40 AM ET (10:40 GMT), while Dow futures dipped 192 points or 0.7% and S&P 500 futures declined 21 points or 0.7%.
The news from Hong Kong will heighten market sensitivity to any further signs of deterioration in the U.S.-China trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the two countries were unlikely to continue talks next month. 
The People’s Bank of China set the official midpoint reference for the yuan at 7.0211 per dollar, weaker than on Friday but stronger than expected. The yuan exchange rate has been closely watched as a weaker currency makes a country's exports cheaper, something that has drawn criticism from President Trump. Analysts have argued that if anything, the PBoC is supporting the yuan at present, fearful of a faster depreciation that would make it harder for Chinese companies to repay dollar-denominated debt.
 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 1.1% after reports that one of its electric cars caught fire after hitting a tow truck in Moscow on Saturday, although it was unclear which model it was. The company is under regulatory scrutiny for its claims over the safety of its Model 3.

411,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 06:49AM ET</span>",Burford Capital Alleges of Potential Market Manipulation,"(Bloomberg) -- Burford Capital Ltd., the latest target of short seller Muddy Waters, said it found evidence of illegal market manipulation after a preliminary analysis of trading that led to last week’s record stock slump.
A forensic examination of detailed data by Burford and its expert, Professor Joshua Mitts of Columbia University, “discloses trading activity consistent with material illegal activity,” the litigation-finance firm said in a statement Monday. The company said it has made regulatory authorities and criminal prosecutors aware of its findings and is considering its own options.
Burford’s traumatic week began when the stock sank 19% on Tuesday, the same day that Muddy Waters tweeted it would release a report the following day on a company it didn’t name. The shares then plunged 46% on Wednesday after Muddy Waters, the research firm founded by Carson Block, published a 25-page report saying that Burford overstated the returns it earns on its investments and has questionable financial reporting and governance.
In its statement, Burford said that in the hours after Muddy Waters’ initial tweet, almost 90 million pounds ($109 million) of sell orders in its shares were placed and canceled without being filled, for a stock whose average daily volume is less than a fifth of that amount. It also released a detailed breakdown of trading activity showing that only a small proportion of sell orders that were created were actually executed, with most being canceled.
“It strains credulity to believe that a decline on the order of hundreds of millions of pounds in market capitalization was driven solely by actual trading amounting to a few hundred thousand pounds absent market manipulation,” Burford said in its statement.
Falling Value
Burford’s market value has fallen to less than 1.8 billion pounds from more than 3 billion pounds only a week ago.
A spokesman for the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority said the regulator “is aware of these matters” and has been undertaking “wide-ranging enquiries,” which will continue.
Burford shares fell 7.2% at 8:40 a.m. in London, after initially extending their rally to a third straight session. The stock rose 41% in the two days after the company rebutted Muddy Waters’s report and executives purchased shares. Chief Investment Officer Jonathan Molot bought an additional 339,963 shares on Friday, taking his stake to 4.23%, according to a separate statement Monday.
Muddy Waters isn’t the only short seller to scrutinize Burford. Gotham City Research LLC, which shorted the stock last year but doesn’t currently have a short position, said on Sunday that the company isn’t being financed appropriately because of the risks associated with litigation assets. In response, Burford said it has a conservative asset-liability profile, with average concluded investment duration of less than two years and average debt maturity of almost six years, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.8%."
412,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 06:46AM ET</span>",Cathay Falls as It Draws China Wrath Over Hong Kong Protests,"(Bloomberg) -- Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. shares tumbled to their lowest levels in a decade as China hit out at the airline after its employees joined anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong.
Cathay shares lost 4.9% to HK$9.80 on Monday, the lowest close since June 2009. Cathay’s parent Swire Pacific Ltd. fell 6.2%, the steepest drop in almost four years, to HK$76.70.
Late Friday, China’s civil aviation authority issued a swathe of demands to Hong Kong’s dominant airline, including barring employees who supported the recent protests from flying to the mainland, and asking the company to submit information about all crew members flying to China for verification and authorization.
In response, Cathay said it took the directives very seriously. It suspended a pilot who had been detained while participating in a protest and fired two workers for “misconduct.”
The move escalated Beijing’s actions against corporations seen as supporting -- or at least tolerating -- staff participation in city protests that have dragged on for more than two months. Over the weekend, signs emerged that Hong Kong authorities used more aggression against demonstrators, with riot police videotaped beating demonstrators in subway stations.
For Cathay, the aviation directive forces it to choose between fueling the wrath of its workers, or those of China -- possibly the company’s most important market. Though the carrier doesn’t disclose a breakdown of its mainland China business, flights originating from there and Hong Kong account for about half the firm’s revenue.
The Chinese authority’s order could threaten not only Cathay’s direct flights to China but also those to Europe and the U.S. because those routes fly over Chinese airspace, Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. analyst Andrew Lee wrote in a note to clients.
The Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation expressed “deep regret” over the Chinese regulator’s demands and criticized the CAAC for making policies restricting Hong Kong people’s legal rights and freedom, and damaging the “one country, two systems“ principle by which the city is governed.
Cathay is controlled by the U.K.’s Swire family, though the airline counts government-run Air China Ltd. as its second-largest shareholder. One of the most high-profile brands in Hong Kong, Cathay became a visible target for Beijing last week after many of its employees took part in a general strike that resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
In its warning on Friday, the Chinese regulator ordered Cathay to submit a plan for boosting internal controls, flight safety and security by Aug. 15.
Cathay’s actions, or lack thereof “have led to a severe threat to aviation safety, created negative social impact and increased the risk of flying from Hong Kong to the mainland,” according to the CAAC statement.

413,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 06:42AM ET</span>","Asian shares falter as U.S.-China trade war, recession worries weigh","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Yen and bond bulls charged on Monday while stocks struggled again, amid ongoing worries that a prolonged U.S.-China trade war and damaging Brexit could tip top economies into recession. 
Early gains for Europe's main bourses had quickly disappeared and Wall Street futures were already in the red after Asia-Pacific had also finished lower overnight.
That was despite a more than 1% rally for Chinese stocks after the yuan had avoided further drama and financial regulators there had relaxed margin financing rules late on Friday.
Safety remained the name of the game. FX harbour, the Japanese yen, hit its highest in nearly a year and a half at 105.32 yen against the dollar and gained against the euro and Brexit-bruised British pound too. 
""Risk indicators and global markets have become more shaky and the yen is reflecting those concerns, and safe-haven shelters like the yen and the Swiss franc should continue to benefit,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt.
In bond markets, the demand for guaranteed income was also unrelenting. A rally in Italy's debt gave it an extra boost after Fitch kept country's rating steady despite the prospect of snap elections in the euro zone's third biggest economy now looming.
There were signs that League leader Matteo Salvini's call for those snap elections was facing mounting resistance from other parties whose support will be needed for the plan to succeed.
""Fitch kept Italy's rating unchanged and some market participants may be betting that a snap election could be delayed,"" said DZ Bank rates strategist Sebastian Fellechner, referring to the fall in yields. 
Economists are also watching for a batch of global data this week. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) became the latest to cut its U.S. growth forecast at the weekend, warning that a U.S. China trade deal now looked unlikely before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
One week ago, China allowed the yuan to break through the key 7-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008, prompting Washington to label Beijing a currency manipulator and sparking market ructions.
The International Monetary Fund said on Friday that it stood by its assessment that the value of China's yuan was largely in line with economic fundamentals.
MIXED MESSAGES
On Friday, Wall Street snapped a three-day winning streak after U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington was continuing trade talks with Beijing, but that the U.S. was not going to make a deal for now.
Those comments helped to drive a late sell-off in a volatile session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average fall 0.34%, the S&P 500 lose 0.66% and the Nasdaq Composite drop 1%.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro subsequently said that the United States was still planning to hold another round of trade talks with Chinese negotiators.
Wall Street futures were down 0.5%. 
In commodities, oil prices dipped on growth and trade worries, having risen sharply on Friday on a drop in European inventories and production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
International benchmark Brent crude futures were at $58.16 a barrel by 0829 GMT, down 37 cents from their previous settlement.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were at $53.89 per barrel, down 61 cents from their last close.
Both benchmarks fell last week, with Brent losing more than 5% and WTI falling about 2%.
""The market is facing a buyers' strike,"" said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, noting the low level of investors' long positions betting on higher prices.
""Despite the laundry list of disruptions and additional barrels at risk, investor length is currently near a multi-year low.""
Argentina's markets were ready for a slump too after voters soundly rejected President Mauricio Macri's austere economic policies in primary elections at the weekend, raising serious questions about his chances of re-election in October.
Argentina's 2028-maturing, euro-denominated government bond was down more than 11 cents in European trading, Tradeweb data showed.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 06:13AM ET</span>","Coach, Givenchy in hot water over China T-shirt row","By Pei Li and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese brand ambassadors of fashion labels from  Coach  to Givenchy have severed ties with the companies over products which they said violated China's sovereignty by identifying Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries. 
The brands are the latest to get into hot water over political issues in China, which has been more assertive in its territorial claims and how it expects foreign companies doing businesses in China to describe them.
Italian luxury label Versace and its artistic director, Donatella Versace, apologized on Sunday after one of its T-shirts, depicting the territories of Hong Kong and Macau as countries, was criticized on Chinese social media. 
Coach's China ambassador, supermodel Liu Wen, said on Weibo on Monday that she had severed her endorsement deal with the New York-based label over a similar T-shirt, which also listed Taiwan as a country even though Beijing says the self-ruled island is a renegade province. 
""I apologize to everyone for the damage that I have caused as a result of my less-careful choice of brand!"" she said in a Weibo post that was 'liked' hundreds of thousands of times. 
""I love my motherland, and I steadfastly safeguard China's sovereignty.""
Coach, whose parent is Tapestry Inc (N:TPR), said it had found the ""serious inaccuracy"" in May 2018 and had immediately pulled the T-shirts from all its global channels. It added that it ""deeply"" regretted the design. 
""We also reviewed our assortment to ensure compliance, and have strengthened our internal product development process to avoid the occurrence of a similar issue in the future,"" it said. 
""Coach respects and supports China's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" 
The topic ""Coach"" was the hottest item on China's Twitter-like Weibo on Monday morning, receiving 1.2 billion views.
Separately, popular Chinese boy band idol Jackson Yee said on Weibo he had severed ties with LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Givenchy after pictures of one of the brand's T-shirts, which also listed Hong Kong and Taiwan in a similar way, received criticism. 
Givenchy apologized in a Weibo statement on Monday, saying it ""always respects Chinese sovereignty"".
As of Monday afternoon, Skin care brand Fresh, sportswear maker Asics, and fashion designer Calvin Klein all apologized on their Chinese social media accounts for similar website design that recognized China-claimed regions as independent countries.
Foreign brands are under increasing pressure from Chinese consumers and regulators to fall into line on contentious issues around Chinese sovereignty and its territorial claims.
Taiwan is self-governed and has a democratically elected leadership, but China claims the island as a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to ensure unification. The question of Taiwan's formal independence is one of Beijing's most sensitive political concerns.

Beijing is also facing one of its most popular challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012 in Hong Kong, where demonstrators say they are fighting against the erosion of the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement enshrining some autonomy for Hong Kong when China took it back in 1997.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 06:13AM ET</span>","Rosengren is ideal candidate to transform ABB, says Chairman","By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB (S:ABBN) shares jumped more than 4% on Monday as investors welcomed news the Swiss engineering group had poached Bjorn Rosengren from Swedish mining equipment firm  Sandvik  (ST:SAND) to be its next chief executive.
The 60-year-old Swede will join the Zurich-based maker of industrial drives and robots in February and take over as CEO in March, the company said on Sunday.
ABB, whose previous CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer left suddenly in April, is in the middle of overhauling its business following years of lackluster profit and bungled acquisitions.
Chairman Peter Voser, who has taken on CEO functions on an interim basis, said on Monday he was confident he had got the right man. 
""He has a great track record of empowering businesses in a decentralized way, that is what he has done at Sandvik and at his earlier businesses as well,"" Voser said.
""He is focused on driving performance,"" added the former CEO of oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) who will revert back to his chairman role when Rosengren takes charge.
During his four years at Sandvik, Rosengren revamped the metal-cutting tools and mining gear maker and sold off underperforming businesses.
TRACK RECORD
Voser said Rosengren would follow ABB's strategy of reducing its corporate center and giving more power to its four business units - industrial automation, electrification, motion and robotics and discrete automation.
""Over the last few months ... the company has outlined a strategy and we are following through on that,"" Voser said.
""But a strategy will not be cast in stone for five years."" 
ABB, whose shares have lost 14% over the last five years, is selling its power grids business to Hitachi and last month announced a deal to quit the solar energy inverters business.
Voser has launched a review of businesses which generate $3 billion of revenue, or 11% of ABB's total, which could be improved or sold.
""With the appointment of Rosengren, ABB will have a CEO with a proven track record and a strong reputation in the capital markets for delivering operational improvement,"" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analyst Alexander Virgo.
""In our view, his success at Sandvik in implementing a decentralized business model should make him a good match for ABB.""
ABB's largest shareholder  Investor  AB (ST:INVEb) also welcomed the appointment of Rosengren, who before Sandvik was CEO of Wartsila (HE:WRT1V), which makes and services power sources for the marine and energy markets.
""From his previous leading roles in several companies, he has a proven track record in driving a decentralized culture, improving performance and delivering value,"" said Johan Forssell, CEO of Investor, which holds 11.2% of ABB.
Sandvik's shares have increased by 78% with Rosengren in charge, as margins improved, while Wartsila's share price increased 83% on his watch.
Activist investor Cevian Capital, ABB's second-biggest shareholder with a 5.3% stake, said ABB shares could almost double in value if Rosengren could lift margins and valuations to match rivals. 
""If these gaps are closed, ABB should be worth more than 35 CHF (Swiss francs). That is Bjorn's main task,"" said Cevian managing partner Christer Gardell.

At 0940 GMT, ABB shares were up 4.3% at 18.29 francs

LONDON (Reuters) - London-listed litigation funder Burford Capital (L:BURF) said it has found evidence of suspect trading patterns in its shares around the time short-seller Muddy Waters issued a report challenging the company's accounts last week. 
Burford said an investigation by the fund and an expert in market manipulation found trading activity in its shares on Aug. 6 and Aug. 7 was generally consistent with ""material illegal activity"". 
Burford's shares fell 19% last Tuesday, the day short-seller Muddy Waters tweeted about a forthcoming short position against an unidentified company, and dived a further 46% on Wednesday when Muddy Waters released a report criticizing Burford's accounts and management.
The fund said it had made regulators and criminal prosecutors aware of its preliminary findings and was considering its options.
Muddy Waters - founded by American Carson Block, who built up his reputation by alleging fraudulent activities at Chinese firms he targeted - said in response that the ""only manipulation is that of Burford's return metrics, accounts and disclosures"".
Burford's shares fell as much as 14% on Monday morning following the company's statement. It had been the biggest stock on London's junior AIM market before the plunge last week that wiped 2 billion pounds from its valuation at one point.
Britain's financial markets regulator said that it is now making ""wide-ranging enquiries"" into the circumstances surrounding the short-selling report on Burford.
A spokeswoman for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the regulator had been ""aware of these matters since the first tweet and price movements on Tuesday of last week.""
""We will continue to make enquiries using the wide range of data and resources at our disposal,"" the FCA added.
In its statement, Burford alleged it had identified evidence that its stock had been targeted by 'spoofing' and 'layering' manipulation. 
Spoofing is where a stock price is artificially driven lower due to high volumes of trading orders being placed just below the current price but then canceled before being executed. Layering involves placing and cancelling orders at higher prices in an attempt to give the impression of high trading volumes.
Burford said that several hours after Muddy Waters' tweet on Aug. 6, almost 90 million pounds worth of sell orders were placed and then canceled without being filled - five times its average daily trading volume.
Muddy Waters has alleged that Burford has ""egregiously"" misrepresented its return on invested capital and internal rates of returns. Burford has refuted the allegations, saying it is solvent with strong cashflow.
Analysts at KBW said in a note on Sunday that an independent audit would be required to assess Muddy Waters' allegations about Burford and said the litigation funder was ""structurally... a market leader in a highly profitable sector"".

Investing.com -- The dog days of summer have finally arrived for most of Europe’s stock markets, but Brexit continues to cast a long shadow over the U.K.’s.
The FTSE 100 was down 0.2% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT) on a Monday morning when all of the continent’s markets were rebounding – if only in depressed, holiday-affected volumes. The broader FTSE All-Share and FTSE 250 indexes were also underperforming.
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was flat at 371.58, having lost earlier gains, while the German Dax was up 0.1% and Switzerland’s SMI up 0.2%.
Among the worst performers were   National Grid   (LON:NG), which fell 0.7% after a devastating outage on Friday left large parts of England, including much of London without power. EasyJet (LON:EZJ) was the biggest loser, down 4.0% and leading a broader sectoral decline amid fears that it may face regulatory action for failing to rebook passengers whose flights were cancelled. HSBC (LON:HSBA) was down 2.3%, extending its losses since chief executive John Flint’s ouster last week highlighted the strategic problems of a U.K. bank caught up in the U.S.-China trade war.
The moves came after a weekend when the pound hit its lowest level since 2016 against both the dollar and the euro. It’s been on a losing streak since Boris Johnson was confirmed as Prime Minister in July, after winning the Conservative party’s leadership contest with a promise to take the U.K. out of the EU on Oct. 31, without any transitional arrangements to soften the blow.
‘No-Deal’ is now widely accepted as the most likely Brexit outcome, reflected in the fact that speculative selling of sterling is at its highest level since May 2017, according to data released on Friday by the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and elsewhere have argued that the pound could fall to an all-time low of parity to the dollar if the U.K. crashes out without a deal in October.
The new government’s policy has incensed business: supermarkets have warned of higher food prices, the Road Haulage Association has warned of chaos at British ports due to the introduction of customs and border checks, while farmers have warned that tens of thousands of sheep and cattle may have to be slaughtered since U.K. produce will be subjected to tariffs and other checks in its biggest export market.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said earlier this month that a No-Deal Brexit would result in a “real economic shock” for the country.
Johnson, who campaigned in 2016 promising that there would be no obstacles to trade with the EU after Brexit, has said that leaving on Oct. 31 is the only way to “restore trust in our politics.”
Johnson has made a series of spending pledges in recent days that have been interpreted widely as preparations for a snap election as early as November. At the weekend, he announced plans for higher spending on prisons, something widely interpreted as an attempt to appeal to supporters of the Brexit party, whose votes would be theoretically be up for grabs after the U.K. leaves the EU. He has already issued similar pledges to spend more on hospitals and schools."

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) pared earlier gains, moving 0.2% higher with the technology (SX8P) and chemicals (SX4P) sectors leading gains.
Trading volumes were light as most key markets in Asia were closed for certain holidays.
But investors were still hesitant to make bold moves as worries of the prolonged U.S.-China trade spat still hovered over markets - with no sign of a truce in sight. This past weekend, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) warned that a trade deal was unlikely before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
The latest salvos between Beijing and Washington have increased fears about a further slowdown of the already fragile global economy, with dire industrial output data from Germany and the UK economy's first contraction since 2012 adding to growth pangs.
""Don't think there is any renewed positivity for any of the situations (trade, growth worries, Italy) but since a lot of negativity was baked in last week, it seems fairly quiet today,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.
Market attention this week will be on the German economy's growth numbers due on Wednesday and the U.S. Federal Reserve's annual symposium later in the week, where investors hope to get some clarity on the future path of interest rates.
On the corporate front, the bidding war for Osram (DE:OSRn) got more intense after Swiss-listed sensor specialist AMS (S:AMS) said it was ready to pay 10% more than Bain Capital and Carlyle (O:CG).
Osram, which is grappling with weakness in the automotive industry and a broader economic slowdown, is seen as a potential supplier for connected and autonomous cars.
Osram shares were up 10%, while AMS shares fell 9%.
Despite lower crude prices, the oil and gas sector (SXEP) was higher as Britain's  Tullow Oil  Plc (L:TLW) jumped as much as 20% after it announced a major oil discovery in the Orinduik block in Guyana.
ABB (S:ABBN) was up nearly 4% and was the top gainer on the blue-chip board (STOXX50) after investors welcomed news the Swiss engineering group had poached Bjorn Rosengren from mining equipment firm  Sandvik  (ST:SAND) to be its next chief executive.
Among decliners, miners pushed the basic resources index (SXPP) 0.4% lower as Dalian iron ore futures slumped to a two-month low over worries of slowing demand.

Austria's AMS triggered a bidding war by saying it was ready to pay $3.8 billion for the German lighting group's shares, a 10% premium over what finance investors Bain Capital and Carlyle have already offered.
Shares in AMS were indicated 6.65% lower.
Osram, which is grappling with weakness in the automotive industry and a broader economic slowdown, had sparked bidding interest because of its potential as a supplier for connected and autonomous cars.
Osram had no immediate comment.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares in Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) fell more than 4% to close to a 10-year low on Monday after the Hong Kong flag carrier became caught in crosswinds between Beijing and pro-democracy groups in the Asian financial hub.
Increasingly violent protests since June have plunged Hong Kong into its most serious crisis in decades and are one of the biggest popular challenges to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.
Cathay became embroiled on Friday when China's civil aviation regulator demanded the airline suspend personnel who engaged in or supported illegal protests in Hong Kong from staffing flights into its airspace, citing safety concerns.
The airline moved fast to comply with the demand from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), suspending a pilot arrested during anti-government protests in Hong Kong and firing two airport employees citing misconduct on Saturday. 
It also said it would bar ""overly radical"" staff from crewing flights to the mainland, and analysts said the tighter oversight, along with the impact the protests could have on traffic, could affect the airline's bottom line.
""Not only is this likely to affect direct China flights, but also flights to Europe and, to a lesser extent, to the U.S., given that they fly over China airspace,"" Jefferies analyst Andrew Lee said.
Passenger traffic in mainland China, Europe and North America accounted for over 50% of all Cathay's traffic in the first half of this year, according to Jefferies data. 
Cathay's shares tumbled to HK$9.82 on Monday morning, their lowest since October 2018 and near levels not seen since the 2009 financial crisis. 
STAFFING QUESTION
Cathay's largest shareholder is Swire Pacific Ltd (HK:0019), with a 45% stake, followed by China's flagship carrier,  Air China  Ltd (HK:0753) (SS:601111) which owns 30%, according to the airline's latest annual report. 
The company, which in March reported its first profit in three years, has seen a decline in forward bookings for travel to Hong Kong due to the Hong Kong protests. 
It was not immediately clear how the regulator's directive would affect flight staffing. Cathay CEO Rupert Hogg told staff the company would report to the CAAC by Thursday on how it would improve flight safety, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters.
Cathay did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation, a union representing airline employees, has criticized the regulator. 
In a statement on Saturday, it said the CAAC should have ""respected Hong Kong people's rights and freedoms"" on the basis of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which guarantees the former British colony a high degree of autonomy from Beijing.

428,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 01:02AM ET</span>","Goldman, JPMorgan Flag Caution on China Stocks","(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks might be about to face more headwinds.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). cut its earnings-per-share estimates for the MSCI China Index amid increased U.S.-China trade frictions and lower potential for valuations to rise, while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. says investor flows show that the country’s stocks are currently overbought.
Estimated EPS growth on the MSCI China Index for 2019 will be 6% from 8% and in 2020 9% from 10%, Goldman strategists led by Kinger Lau wrote in a note Saturday. That’s as market-implied probability of a trade resolution falls to 12% and Goldman’s economists no longer expect a trade deal before the 2020 U.S. presidential election. They have a 12-month target of 82 for the index, to September 2020, implying a gain of 12% through then.
Read: China’s Profit Warnings Signal More Gloom for the Economy
JPMorgan cites flows as a reason to be bearish.
Positioning measures including margin transactions suggest that leveraged institutional investors, such as hedge funds, rather than retail, are more likely to have been responsible for this year’s rally in Chinese onshore equities, strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note Friday. There has been a sharp increase in net long positions by futures investors this year, according to the strategists.
“The Chinese equity market looks currently pretty overbought especially compared to last year,” the report said.
Chinese stocks enjoyed a heady rise at the beginning of the year, with the MSCI China gauge rallying 23% from the start of 2019 through early April as fears about an economic downturn subsided and the People’s Bank of China loosened some policy measures.
The index, which has large- and mid-cap stocks and covers about 85% of the Chinese equity universe according to MSCI, has fallen 16% in the past four months as concerns about trade and earnings have come back to the fore. It’s now up 2.8% in 2019, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500 Index and a 12% advance for the MSCI All-Country World Index.
While China’s equities are likely overbought, the yuan appears to be oversold, JPMorgan said, citing a steady rise in long dollar/short yuan positions since mid-2018. The strategists also noted that Chinese onshore bonds should benefit from increased expectations of rate cuts by the People’s Bank of China in an escalation scenario.
“FX investors have been preparing for a Chinese currency depreciation for some time,” the strategists said. “So from an investor positioning perspective, Chinese onshore equities look more vulnerable than the Chinese currency if the U.S.-China trade war escalates further from here.“"

430,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 12:34AM ET</span>",Cathay Falls as It Faces China Wrath Over Hong Kong Protests,"(Bloomberg) -- Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. shares headed for their lowest level in a decade as China hit out at the airline after its employees joined anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong.
Cathay shares lost 4.5% to HK$9.84 as of 10:59 a.m., set for the lowest close since June 2009. Swire Pacific Ltd., Cathay’s parent, fell 5.3% to HK$77.50.
Late Friday, China’s civil aviation authority issued a swathe of demands to Hong Kong’s dominant airline, including barring employees who supported the recent protests from flying to the mainland, and asking the company to submit information about all crew members flying to China for verification and authorization.
In response, Cathay said it took the directives very seriously. It suspended a pilot who had been detained while participating in a protest and fired two workers for “misconduct.”
The move escalated Beijing’s actions against corporations seen as supporting -- or at least tolerating -- staff participation in city protests that have dragged on for more than two months. Over the weekend, signs emerged that Hong Kong authorities used more aggression against demonstrators, with riot police videotaped beating demonstrators in subway stations.
For Cathay, the aviation directive forces it to choose between fueling the wrath of its workers, or those of China -- possibly the company’s most important market. Though the carrier doesn’t disclose a breakdown of its mainland China business, flights originating from there and Hong Kong account for about half the firm’s revenue.
The Chinese authority’s order could threaten not only Cathay’s direct flights to China but also those to Europe and the U.S. because those routes fly over Chinese airspace, Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. analyst Andrew Lee wrote in a note to clients.
The Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation expressed “deep regret” over the Chinese regulator’s demands and criticized the CAAC for making policies restricting Hong Kong people’s legal rights and freedom, and damaging the “one country, two systems“ principle by which the city is governed.
Cathay is controlled by the U.K.’s Swire family, though the airline counts government-run Air China Ltd. as its second-largest shareholder. One of the most high-profile brands in Hong Kong, Cathay became a visible target for Beijing last week after many of its employees took part in a general strike that resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
In its warning on Friday, the Chinese regulator ordered Cathay to submit a plan for boosting internal controls, flight safety and security by Aug. 15.
Cathay’s actions, or lack thereof “have led to a severe threat to aviation safety, created negative social impact and increased the risk of flying from Hong Kong to the mainland,” according to the CAAC statement.

""We expect tariffs targeting the remaining $300bn of US imports from China to go into effect,"" the bank said in a note sent to clients.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Aug. 1 that he would impose a 10% tariff on a final $300 billion worth of Chinese imports on Sept. 1, prompting China to halt purchases of U.S. agricultural products.

Goldman Sachs said it lowered its fourth-quarter U.S. growth forecast by 20 basis points to 1.8% on a larger than expected impact from the developments in the trade tensions.
""Overall, we have increased our estimate of the growth impact of the trade war,"" the bank said in the note authored by three of its economists, Jan Hatzius, Alec Phillips and David Mericle.

He will take over from acting ABB CEO Peter Voser in March, with Voser reverting to his position as chairman of the board at ABB, according to the company's statement.
Voser took over temporarily as head of ABB after Ulrich Spiesshofer left suddenly in April.
Businesses which generate $3 billion of revenue, 11% of ABB's total annual sales, are now under review and could be sold off or closed down, Voser told Reuters in a recent interview.
Voser, the former Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) CEO, who is also ABB's chairman, has pledged a turnaround after years of unsatisfactory performance. ABB shares have fallen nearly 20% in the last five years.

Tens of thousands of Russians staged what observers called the country's biggest political protest for eight years on Saturday, defying a crackdown to demand free elections to Moscow's city legislature. Multiple YouTube channels broadcast the event live. 
The watchdog, Roscomnadzor, said some entities had been buying advertising tools from YouTube, such as push notifications, in order to spread information about illegal mass protests, including those aimed at disrupting elections. 
It said Russia would consider a failure by Google to respond to the request as ""interference in its sovereign affairs"" and ""hostile influence (over) and obstruction of democratic elections in Russia"".
If the company does not take measures to prevent events from being promoted on its platforms, Russia reserves the right to respond accordingly, Roscomnadzor said, without giving details.
Over the past five years, Russia has introduced tougher laws requiring search engines to delete some search results, messaging services to share encryption keys with security services, and social networks to store Russian users' personal data on servers within the country.
A Google spokesperson in Russia declined to comment on Sunday.
Moscow has a track record of putting regulatory pressure on Google, one of the main rivals of Russian internet search company  Yandex  (O:YNDX). 
In late 2018, Russia fined Google 500,000 rubles ($7,663) for failing to comply with a legal requirement to remove certain entries from its search results.
Earlier that year, Google removed a YouTube advert by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny after authorities complained that the videos violated a law prohibiting campaigning ahead of a vote for regional governors.

Asked in a video published on REN TV website if he was using an Autopilot self-driving system, driver Alexei Tretyakov said he was in a drive assistance mode in which he was still holding the steering wheel.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has stood by safety claims for its Model 3 in the face of regulatory scrutiny, while documents showed the top U.S. automotive safety watchdog issued at least five subpoenas since last year seeking information about crashes involving the company's vehicles.
Tretyakov said was driving at around 100 km (62 miles) per hour -- the speed limit -- when the car crashed on its left side into the stationary tow truck that he had not noticed.
Footage of the incident on state TV channel Rossiya 24 showed the car by the side of the road engulfed in flames and thick black smoke. Two small explosions occurred within a few seconds of each other and the metal frame of the vehicle was all that remained after the fire, TV footage showed.
Russia's RIA state news agency website posted a video showing the car driving in the left-hand lane of Moscow's ring road, known as the MKAD, before crashing into a tow truck parked by a safety fence that separates the carriageway from oncoming traffic.
The accident took place at around 2100 Moscow time (1800 GMT).
Tretyakov, a financial market expert and the head of Arikapital investment company, said he broke his leg in the incident, while his two children suffered only bruises. They all escaped from the vehicle.

Tesla was not immediately available for a comment on the incident outside normal business hours.

The hour-long outage on Friday evening left almost 1 million homes without power while two of London's busiest train stations closed at rush-hour because of overcrowding as services were canceled or delayed.
A hospital in the eastern town of Ipswich said its back-up generator had failed while the cut also hit the airport and metro system of the city of Newcastle in northeast England.
""Ofgem has asked for an urgent detailed report from  National Grid  (LON:NG) so we can understand what went wrong and decide what further steps need to be taken,"" the energy watchdog said in a statement. ""This could include enforcement action.""
National Grid, which owns the electricity transmission system in England and Wales, said there had been a rare and unusual issue which had led to the almost simultaneous loss of power from two generators.
""Our normal automatic response mechanisms came into help manage the event,"" Duncan Burt, National Grid's Operations Director, told BBC radio.
""But the loss of power was so significant that it fell back to a set of secondary back-up systems which resulted in a proportion of electrical demand across the country being disconnected for a short period to help keep the rest of the system safe.""
He said that action meant power to the vast bulk of the country had been maintained but he said they appreciated the disruption the outage had caused to others.
""We will want to look at that automatic chain of events,"" he said. National Grid would provide Ofgem with a detailed, technical report into the incident, but was confident it had not been not a malicious or a cyber attack, he added.
While the system returned to normal on Friday night, disruption was expected to continue into Saturday with rail operators saying trains had not ended up in their correct destination meaning services would still be affected."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has approved new statutes for the Vatican Bank, making an external audit obligatory and introducing other changes to bolster reforms that have turned around the once scandal-ridden institution.
The statutes, approved in a papal document released by the Vatican on Saturday, cap more than six years of changes at the bank since Francis was elected in 2013, since when he has made reform of the bank one of his priorities.
The bank had been caught in previous years in cases of corruption, tax evasion, embezzlement, money laundering and real estate fraud, some involving top officials and prelates, damaging the Vatican's ethical credentials.
Andrea Tornielli, the Vatican's editorial director, called the new rules ""an important step in the process of adhering to the best international standards.""
Soon after his election, Francis considered closing the bank, formally known as the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR), but decided to continue reforms launched by his predecessor Pope Benedict.
The new statutes make an external audit mandatory. While this has taken place in the past few years, the previous statutes, issued in 1990 by Pope John Paul, called for internal audits.
The new rules ban bank employees, nearly all of whom are non-clerics, from holding consultancies or other roles with outside institutions.
FINANCIAL SCANDALS
The number of members of the lay board of supervisors, which is made up of internationally known outside financial experts, is increased to seven from five.
This will effectively strengthen the role of the lay board and weaken that of a supervisory commission of cardinals, whose number remains five.
For decades before reforms were implemented, the IOR was embroiled in numerous financial scandals as people with no right to have accounts opened them and used them for illicit purposes with the complicity of corrupt insiders.
In the past six years, hundreds of accounts have been closed at the IOR, whose stated purpose is to manage funds for the Church, Vatican employees, religious institutes, or Catholic charities.
Last year, the Vatican's controller, the Financial Information Authority (AIF), carried out an on-site inspection of the IOR to ensure it was complying with anti-money laundering legislation and the outcome was ""substantially positive"", the AIF said in its report for that year. 

In 2017, Italy put the Vatican on its ""white list"" of states with cooperative financial institutions, ending years of mistrust. The same year, Moneyval, a monitoring body of the Council of Europe, gave Vatican reforms a mostly positive evaluation, particularly those carried out at the bank.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 09:38PM ET</span>",Investors look for consumer pressure ahead of next tariffs,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - As President Donald Trump prepares to slap new tariffs on Chinese imports, investors are bracing for signs of pressure on U.S. consumers as top retailers begin reporting quarterly results next week and key consumer sentiment and retail sales data is released.
Investors and analysts are anxious about the impact of Trump's planned 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports, which will largely affect consumer goods, unlike the previous round that fell heavily on industrial and business products. That could be a double-whammy for the U.S. economy, which is about 70 percent driven by consumers, and retailers.
Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in New York, is among analysts focusing on the fallout from the tariffs, noting that the planned new round will ""disproportionately"" impact consumer goods.
""We'll be watching the data particularly around retail sales and consumer confidence,"" Mahajan said. ""We'll continue to monitor the softening in manufacturing and inflation as well, but more important for the U.S. economic picture is the consumer right now.""
July retail sales data is due out on Thursday. Excluding autos, sales are expected to have grown 0.3% compared with 0.4% in June, according to a Reuters poll. On Friday, The University of Michigan's preliminary August reading of consumer sentiment is expected to show a slip to 97.7 from 98.4 in July. 
The S&P Retail index <.SPXRT> fell a total of 5.3% in the first three trading sessions following Trump's Aug. 1 tariff announcement. As of Thursday's market close, the index was down 1.6% for the month so far.
UBS analyst Jay Sole said fears that the tariffs could eventually increase to 25% were also an overhang for stocks.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has estimated that 25% tariffs would lead to a global recession. 
Retailers will have the dilemma of deciding whether to pass the tariffs on to consumers in the form of higher prices or absorb the higher costs, which would reduce profit margins. 
""If you're in a competitive environment you're going to take some action to keep your customers,"" said Charles East, an equity analyst covering consumer companies at SunTrust Private Wealth Management, who said that department stores are particularly vulnerable.
""I really don't think they can push prices up because their sales are already weak,"" East said. ""The margins are under pressure. Perhaps they can accelerate cost-cutting."" 
With two thirds of U.S. footwear coming from China, for example, UBS's Sole will look for comments in earnings calls and statements on how retailers and footwear companies plan to handle the tariffs.
""It's a big deal. Our assumption is that there will be an attempt to raise prices on the goods,"" Sole said.
""We think consumers are going to resist those price increases,"" he added, citing a UBS survey of 7,660 consumers in July that showed 77% of respondents were worried the China trade war would cause prices to rise.
Retailers reporting next week include Macy's Inc (N:M), Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Tapestry Inc (N:TPR), whose brands include  Coach , Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. The following week  Kohls Corp  (N:KSS),  Target  (N:TGT) and  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) will all report. 
The S&P Consumer Discretionary index (SPLRCD), which includes big retailers, is expected to report a 1.2% increase in second-quarter earnings, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
But estimates for the rest of the year have been falling. Wall Street now expects third-quarter earnings growth of 1.8% compared with a 6.8% expectation on July 1 while the fourth-quarter estimate has fallen to 6.5% from 9.8%.
Mitigating factors for consumer companies include a strong labor market, low inflation, declining interest rates and low gas prices, according to David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston. 
But Joy cautioned that recent strength in the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence index may not last.

""When confidence is at these types of levels, it may have peaked and will decline if the economy slows further or the stock market sells off sharply,"" he said.

BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) -  Peugeot  maker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and partner Dongfeng Group (HK:0489) have agreed to cut thousands of jobs in China and drop two of their four shared assembly plants, according to a document seen by Reuters, in a last-ditch bid to curb mounting losses as the world's largest auto market loses steam.
Dongfeng Peugeot Citroen Automobiles (DPCA), the carmakers' joint venture based in Wuhan, central China, will halve its workforce to 4,000 as it closes one plant and sells another under plans agreed last month between PSA boss Carlos Tavares and Dongfeng Chairman Zhu Yanfeng, the document showed.
Both carmakers declined to comment on details of their restructuring plans. ""We are working with our partners to improve the overall performance of our business in China in all its dimensions,"" a PSA spokesman said.
The agreement may avert a threatened withdrawal by PSA, according to two sources at the French carmaker who said their chief executive had signaled that PSA might otherwise exit the 27-year-old partnership with its 12.2% shareholder Dongfeng, or even leave China altogether.
""We're just a whisker away from having to withdraw from China,"" said one person close to the PSA board. ""It really is that serious.""
PSA is attempting a reboot in adverse conditions. Once an auto industry cash cow, the Chinese market contracted last year for the first time since the 1990s and is expected to decline another 5% in 2019, squeezed by a worsening U.S.-China trade war.
Many Western carmakers were already struggling before the downturn, as Chinese consumers abandoned their mid-market brands for increasingly assertive domestic rivals https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autoshow-shanghai-saicgeely/chinese-automakers-saic-geely-turn-up-heat-on-global-rivals-idUSKBN17J128 including the global manufacturers' own local partners.
PSA's deep China problems go back even further, spanning four years of plunging sales and 400 million euros ($450 million) written off its DPCA stake, which is now valued at 500 million euros.
Its sales in the country shrunk almost threefold to 251,700 vehicles last year from a 2014 peak of 731,000.
""We're not giving up,"" a PSA spokesman said. ""We are still pursuing our action plan to cut fixed costs.""
DPCA will now close its original assembly plant, Wuhan 1, and redevelop the site in a commercial partnership with the local government, according to the plans. The factory's tooling and production will be transferred to the Wuhan 3 facility.
Headcount across DPCA will fall from 8,000 to 5,500 by the end of 2019 and to 4,000 within another three years, as it also sells off its idling Wuhan 2 facility, according to the document - which noted ongoing discussions with unidentified potential buyers.
Underperforming vehicles will be dropped as the Peugeot and Citroen lineups are streamlined around more profitable models, mirroring the European turnaround strategy now powering record margins in PSA's home markets.
HURDLES
The carmakers' dealings have often been fraught, and PSA executives including Tavares have voiced frustration with DPCA's management. The French group's shares briefly spiked on an Aug. 7 report that Dongfeng was preparing to divest its PSA stake, acquired in a 2014 bailout.
Questioned by analysts about China operations, Tavares pledged during PSA's July 24 earnings call to ""accelerate variable cost reduction, reduce fixed cost"" and boost pricing.
""Our partner is in the same mindset,"" he said of Dongfeng. ""They also want to accelerate.""
The restructuring faces hurdles, not least the challenge of finding a Wuhan 2 buyer amid mounting uncertainty - although Chinese government restrictions on greenfield sites may help.

Over the past 18 months, Dongfeng's Chairman Zhu tried repeatedly to persuade Honda (T:7267) or Nissan (T:7201) to take over one of the DPCA plants, Reuters reported on Aug 1.

448,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 06:31PM ET</span>",Hedge fund Elliott hires Goldman partner Barg as head of corporate engagement,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Elliott Management, one of the world's busiest activist investors, has hired a  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) partner as its head of corporate engagement as the hedge fund continues to push companies around the globe to perform better.
Steven Barg spent nearly a decade at Goldman and most recently defended corporations against hedge funds like Elliott as the investment bank's global head of activism and shareholder advisory.
Three sources confirmed the hiring on Friday afternoon. Elliott declined to comment; Goldman did not respond to requests for comment, and Barg could not be reached for comment.
As a veteran banker, Barg will bring capital markets expertise plus a deep knowledge of advising companies who have faced pressure from activists.
He spent part of his career in Asia and was co-head of Asian Equity Capital Markets for Goldman. Recently he was advising Sony Corp (T:6758) as it faces pressure from U.S. hedge fund Third Point to spin off its semiconductor unit.
For Elliott the hiring of Barg, one of Wall Street's most prominent bankers, underscores the firm's growing interest in not only pushing independent companies to perform better but also making bids to take some corporations private.
The news of Barg's hire was first reported by Bloomberg.
Elliott, which oversees $35 billion in assets, is considered among the industry's most successful activist investors having waged campaigns at firms including EBay Inc (O:EBAY), software firm SAP and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).
In the first six months of 2019, Elliott outspent all rivals and committed $3.4 billion in new capital, making investments in pharmaceutical and life sciences company  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) and SAP in Germany among others.
Recently Elliott has also expanded its reach into private equity investing by making bids for companies like bookseller Barnes & Noble and Athenahealth.
At Elliott, Barg will lead a executives including Christine O'Brien, head of investment stewardship, and Geoffrey Sorbello, a former Houlihan Lokey banker who works on the firm's activist campaigns.
Defending corporations against activist hedge funds like Elliott and rivals like Third Point and Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management has become big business on Wall Street with many banks beefing up their activism defense practices.
Last week Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) hired former Evercore Inc. banker to become its global head of activism defense.
Roughly a year ago Goldman appointed Pete Michelsen and David Dubner to be co-heads of activism and shareholder advisory for the Americas while Barg headed global shareholder activism defense."

Every day produced either big losses or big gains. On Wednesday, there was a huge loss at the open, followed by a robust recovery.
Friday was like Wednesday, with the major averages falling sharply after President Donald Trump suggested U.S. negotiators would not meet with Chinese trade negotiators next month and there was talk the U.S. would ban sales of chips from U.S. companies to Chinese telecom Huawei.
And then it was as if someone said ""never mind"" until another wave of selling hit in the last few minutes, a signal that investors are nervous about what will come next week. 
The Dow , poster child for the volatility all week, was off as many as 281 points early in the day before recovering to a small gain but losing about 100 points in the last 10 minutes. The index ended the day down 0.34%. The S&P 500 fell 0.66%. The NASDAQ Composite was off 1.0%.
For the week, the indexes were lower, but only modestly -- despite the volality. The Dow dropped about 0.8%. The S&P 500 was off 0.5%. The Nasdaq fell back 0.6%.
The indexes ended the week roughly 3% below their all-time highs reached in mid-to-late July.
While they're up handsomely for 2019, the averages actually finished under their peaks in the late summer and early fall of 2018.
Tech, energy and consumer discretionary stocks were lower, with semiconductor stocks among the weakest because of the U.S.-China fight. Healthcare, utility and financial stocks were mostly higher.
Key stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed down about 0.8%. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) hit a new 52-week high of $221.93 and was the Dow leader with a 1.44% gain. Only eight Dow stocks were higher.
Retailers had a miserable day. JC Penney (NYSE:JCP) moved sharply lower after news the department-store chain's shares could be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. The shares closed at just 60 cents, down 13.5%. Macy’s (NYSE:M) was off 4.4%. Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) fell 2.7%. 
 
While energy stocks were lower, oil prices were higher on news that Saudi Arabia plans to aggressively cut output to push oil higher. West Texas Intermediate crude jumped 3.7% to $54.50 a barrel. Brent Oil Futures, the benchmark global crude, added 2% to $58.53,
Gold futures drifted back to $1,508.50 an ounce on the day and ended the week up 3.5% and above $1,500 for the week for the first time since 2013. Silver, platinum and palladium also were higher on the week.
 
Next week, the earning season is starting to wind down. Economic reports include the consumer price index report for July, due Tuesday, and reports on building permits and housing starts, due Friday. 
Winners and losers in the S&P 500.
Biotech company Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), News Corp B (NASDAQ:NWS) and News Corp A (NASDAQ:NWSA) and MarketAxMarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX) were among the top performing S&P 500 stocks on the day. 
Software company DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC) (formerly Computer Sciences), biopharmaceutical company  Nektar Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:NKTR) and troubled food giant Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) were among the weakest S&P performers on the day. "
452,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 04:46PM ET</span>",U.S. bond yields rise on confusion over U.S. trade move,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday amid confusion over the United States policy on trade with China, while political turmoil in Italy compounded investor concerns, capping a volatile week in the bond market.
Treasury yields fell for a second week, though they stayed above the multi-year lows set on Wednesday when the yield on the 30-year bond came within striking distance of a record low.
Adding to investors' jitters was news that the British economy unexpectedly contracted in the second quarter, the first time since 2012, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to pull the country out of the European Union in October.
""Global economic data continue to trend lower. We like bonds as a diversifier,"" said Bill Merz, head of fixed income research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
Trade tensions between China and United States remain the main driver for financial markets.
President Donald Trump said on Friday the United States is not going to do business with Chinese telecom giant Huawei. His comments supported an earlier Bloomberg report that said Washington was delaying a decision to allow some trade between U.S. firms and China's telecom equipment maker Huawei again.
Trump's remarks were seen as the latest U.S. move pushing the world's two biggest economies toward a full-blown trade war that could spark a global downturn and stoke more turbulence in financial markets.
Wall Street shares fell and pushed bond yields lower.
Bond yields reversed to move higher after Fox Business reporter Edward Lawrence posted a tweet citing a White House official saying that Trump meant ""ONLY the ban on Federal Departments buying from Huawei. White House Official says Commerce Dept Process for special licenses still going forward.""
""It created a whole level of uncertainty and that's not good,"" said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed income at D.A. Davidson in Seattle.
Worries about Italy, the euro zone's third biggest economy, were rekindled late on Thursday after its deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, sought snap elections following a period of public fighting between Salvini's League party and coalition partner the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
In late U.S. trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were 2.1 basis points higher at 1.736%. They hit 1.595% on Wednesday, which was their lowest level since October 2016.
Ten-year yields fell for a second week, marking their steepest two-week drop in nearly eight years, according to Refinitiv data.
The yield on the 30-year, or long, bond (US30YT=RR) was up 0.9 basis point at 2.256%. On Wednesday, the 30-year yield fell to 2.123%, within striking distance of the all-time low of 2.089% set in July 2016, according to Refinitiv data.
Longer-dated yields were supported earlier by data that showed U.S. domestic producer prices grew modestly in July, with core prices posting their first decline since October 2015.
Sluggish inflation, together with trade and geopolitical turmoil, reinforced traders' expectations the Federal Reserve will lower its key lending rate by at least a quarter point at its next policy meeting, on Sept. 17-18.
Interest rates futures implied traders expect the U.S. central bank may cut rates at each of its remaining policy meetings this year, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.

453,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 04:21PM ET</span>",China Cracks Down on Cathay After Staff Join Hong Kong Protests,"(Bloomberg) -- China clamped down on Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. after employees of Hong Kong’s dominant airline joined anti-Beijing protests, one of the strongest signs that Chinese authorities are losing patience with the months-long demonstrations sweeping the former British colony
China’s civil aviation authority said Friday it issued a major aviation safety risk warning to Hong Kong-based Cathay for failing to take appropriate action, and ordered the carrier to ban all employees who supported or joined the recent protests from flying to the mainland starting Saturday.
Cathay’s actions, or lack thereof “have led to a severe threat to aviation safety, created negative social impact and increased the risk of flying from Hong Kong to the mainland,” the Civil Aviation Administration of China said in the statement.
The move, which escalates China’s handling of companies appearing to support the protests, comes as a stark warning for Hong Kong businesses and their workers to stay out of politics. Protesters on Friday began a three-day sit-in at the city’s airport, kicking off a 10th straight weekend of anti-China demonstrations.
For Cathay, controlled by the U.K.’s Swire family, the directive forces it to choose between fueling the wrath of its workers or those of China -- possibly the company’s most important market. Though the carrier doesn’t disclose a breakdown of its mainland China business, flights originating from there and Hong Kong account for about half of the firm’s revenue.
The Chinese authority also ordered Cathay to submit information about all crew members flying to the mainland for verification and authorization starting Sunday. The carrier will also be required to submit a plan for boosting internal controls, flight safety and security by Aug. 15, CAAC said.
China Calls on Hong Kong People to Oppose Violent Protesters
The airline is treating the CAAC’s directives very seriously, a spokesperson said. The company doesn’t tolerate any behavior that may affect aviation safety, the representative said, reiterating earlier comments.
Cathay, one of the most high-profile brands in Hong Kong, became a visible target for Beijing this week after many of its employees took part in a general strike on Monday that resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights. One of the company’s pilots was among the dozens of people charged in recent weeks because of the protest, according to the South China Morning Post.
The actions of Cathay’s employees prompted the English-language Global Times, a nationalist paper published by the Communist Party, to warn this week the company would “pay a painful price.”
Mounting scrutiny from state media prompted Cathay, which counts government-run Air China Ltd. as its second-largest shareholder, to say on Friday -- before the CAAC statement -- that while it supports the “one country, two systems” principle governing Hong Kong, it doesn’t condone activities that may jeopardize the city’s stability or impact aviation safety.
“The personal behavior of individual employees does not represent the company’s position,” it said in that statement. “There is zero tolerance to any inappropriate and unprofessional behavior that may affect aviation safety. ”
Luxury CEOs Rattled as Hong Kong Protests Scare Chinese Shoppers
While Cathay has already warned the unrest affected ticket sales in July and is hurting future bookings, the economic fallout has stretched far beyond the airline. Hong Kong’s gross domestic product contracted in the second quarter from the previous three months, leaving open the prospect of a technical recession if the protests continue."
454,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 04:16PM ET</span>",Market weighs risk of negative U.S. Treasury yields,"By Richard Leong
(Reuters) - Traders and analysts are considering whether U.S. bond yields would fall below zero as a record amount around the world sank into negative territory this week.
The question has become a talking point, and less hypothetical, this week as the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yield reached the brink of breaking to record lows.
Negative yields have become a mainstay in Europe and Japan, abetted by their central banks' negative-rate policy.
The United States is expected to avoid this fate, analysts say, but it can no longer be ruled out.
""It is no longer absurd to think that the nominal yield on U.S. Treasury securities could go negative,"" Joachim Fels, PIMCO's global economic adviser, wrote on Wednesday in a blog post.
On Friday, the 10-year yield on U.S. Treasury notes was 1.73% compared with -0.568% on German Bunds and -0.218% on Japanese government securities.
Interest rates on U.S. Treasury bills went negative in 2015. That happened because of expectations the Federal Reserve was sticking to its near-zero rate policy into the following year due to global economic worries.
RECESSION, FED
For U.S. yields to turn negative for an extended period, a key factor would be whether there is U.S. recession, analysts said.
Steps taken by China and the United States since last week are seen bringing them closer to an all-out trade war that threatens the global economy and financial markets.
Moreover, the Fed Reserve would have to cut rates to near or below zero and restart its quantitative easing program to combat an economic downturn, analysts said.
""We doubt the Fed leadership would seriously entertain the idea now,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities strategists wrote in a research note.
The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have had little to show for adopting negative rates in 2014 and 2016, respectively, to help their economies. While negative rates help borrowers, they have hurt banks and investors.
Fears about a U.S. recession intensified after President Donald Trump last Thursday threatened to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports beginning Sept. 1.
The U.S. bond market's most reliable indicator of a pending recession hit its most alarming level in 12-1/2 years this week.
The premium on three-month bill rates above 10-year note yields reached 40 basis points on Wednesday, the highest since March 2007, before subsiding to 29 basis points on Friday.
The inversion between these two maturities has preceded U.S. recessions in the past 50 years.

SAFE-HAVEN BIDS FOR BONDS
Nervousness about the longest-ever U.S. expansion coming to an end set off a safe-haven stampede into Treasuries, German Bunds and UK gilts as well as yen and gold up and a simultaneous dumping of stocks and other risky assets.
This dramatic shift resulted in record $13.2 trillion worth of negative yielding bonds around the world on Wednesday, according to J.P. Morgan.
With the U.S. economy still expanding and the Fed having a some room to cut rates before hitting zero, traders believe U.S. yields will not turn negative anytime soon.
""At this point, we are not going to see it,"" said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed income at D.A. Davidson in Seattle.
Still prospects of negative U.S. yields will unlikely disappear soon.
""Never say never,"" Wells Fargo strategists said.

458,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 02:54PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Semis Swoon as Huawei Gets Caught Up in US-China Crossfire Again,"Investing,com - President Trump took aim at key Chinese chip customer Huawei Friday and said it was “fine” if the U.S. pulls out of trade talks with China planned for September. But investors in semis disagree and have pushed many chips lower, led by a slump in Micron (NASDAQ:MU). 
“We are not going to do business with Huawei... And I really made the decision. It’s much simpler not doing any business with Huawei...That doesn’t mean we won’t agree to something if and when we make a trade deal,” President Donald Trump said.
Huawei-exposed semi suppliers, including Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell about 2% each on fears that they may have to halt shipments to Huawei – a move that could not only hurt orders but exacerbate the chip inventory overhang that has plagued the sector.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was off nearly 1% as well. The index is down 0.8% this week and 7% on the month. It is still up more than 28% on the year. 
After banning U.S. companies from using telecom infrastructure from Huawei in May, citing national security concerns, Trump lifted the bans in July. 
The sea of red in semis comes less than a month after a trio of chip heavyweights, including Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had delivered better-than-expected quarterly reports and indicated that chip demand could improve in the second half of the year.
While one trade war threatens to leave a wreck in its wake, particularly on semis, another is giving the sector a much needed boost – the Japan-South Korea trade war.
Last month, Japan imposed export restrictions on South Korea, which controls about 70% of the global market for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and 50% for NAND flash memory. Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) alone controls about 40% of the market for DRAM chips.
The move has raised fears of a supply shortage, prompting a rebound in memory prices, which have remained low for about a year.
South Korea’s strong grip on the global memory market has led some to suggest the hysterics about the impact on semis from the U.S.-China war is overstated somewhat; the bigger problem is the glut in memory supplies. 
 “Most of the softening you see today is dominated by the memory pricing. I think as ... the correction and capacity question takes place, probably the pick-up will start again early part of 2020,” said Ajit Manocha, CEO at chip industry association, SEMI."

Within equities, United States stocks funds suffered $15.2 billion in outflows in the same week, the most since December 2018, while emerging equity funds saw the biggest outflow since August 2015 at $6.2 billion, said BAML citing EPFR data.
The moves follow a tumultuous week in global markets, with China letting its yuan fall past the 7-per-dollar level marking the latest salvo in a trade dispute between Beijing and Washington and fresh fears emerging about a global economic pullback.
The yuan's slide on Monday contributed to $12.4 billion exiting global equity funds, the 12th largest ever daily outflow from global equity funds, according to the data.
The volatility pushed investors to assets viewed as safe. A total of $2.3 billion poured into precious metal funds. $11 billion has now shifted into gold in the past 10 weeks, the biggest inflow since Brexit in 2016, BAML said.
As high-yield bond funds experienced the biggest outflow since December 2018, investment-grade bond funds notched up their 29th week of inflows, pulling in $6.7 billion."
462,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 01:36PM ET</span>",Investors embrace ESG investing but don't target gun stocks,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Two new BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) funds that exclude gun makers are off to slow starts as socially-minded investors embrace other products addressing a wide range of issues like environmental and governance concerns, according to flow data at the world's largest asset manager.
Investor scrutiny of gun makers picked up after last year's mass shooting at a Florida high school and has continued through more recent attacks, including in Texas and Ohio last weekend. Some activists have urged asset managers to drop holdings like Sturm Ruger & Co and American Outdoor Brands Corp.
Rather than divest, BlackRock in the spring of 2018 took steps like introducing a pair of gun-free funds to give investors alternatives to traditional products such as the iShares Russell 2000 ETF, which holds 2% of both Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor.
The two new funds have not taken off. The iShares ESG MSCI USA Small-Cap ETF held $52 million as of July 31, dwarfed by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF, with $44 billion. The other, the iShares ESG US Aggregate Bond ETF, had about $69 million.
Both fund totals are ""extremely modest,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, senior director at research firm CFRA.
At the same time, he said flows to so-called ESG funds have spiked overall as investors focus on subjects like the impact of climate change at energy companies or gender pay disparities at technology firms.
Lipper data shows that together, all iShares ESG funds had net deposits of $3.2 billion during the 12 months ended July 31, with the bulk of that, $2.4 billion, coming during 2019. To be sure, the ESG inflow was a small slice of the $143 billion in net deposits to all iShares funds during the 12-month period.
""Unfortunately, although there have been horrific events of gun violence, it doesn't seem investors are keeping it top-of-mind,"" Rosenbluth said. The overall interest in ESG funds, he said, shows ""the investment appeal is broader than any subject that's being excluded,"" he noted.
A BlackRock spokesman did not comment or give details about other steps it has taken, like new gun-free products for pension plans.
Several large banks last year limited financing for gun makers and retailers, but the move had little impact on an industry whose many small manufacturers are able to tap other sources of credit. At gun maker annual meetings last year, top asset managers voted in favor of shareholder calls for safety reports, but also backed directors. 
At its annual shareholder meeting this fall, American Outdoor, parent of Smith & Wesson, will face a shareholder call for the company to adopt a ""human rights"" policy the company says is vague and could expose it to liability.
Morningstar director Jon Hale said worried investors could relax about gun makers that make up tiny fractions of big index funds, which account for most of the gun makers' top investors. More important is the pressure fund firms can bring on gun makers, he said.

The outcome of owning gun stocks in a diversified index fund, Hale said, ""is a de minimis impact on your portfolio.""

Both companies grew to become global giants, although  Nike  (N:NKE) overtook Adidas and Reebok - later bought by Adidas - to become the biggest U.S. sports brand in the 1980s, leaving Adidas in second place and Puma lagging further behind.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 01:16PM ET</span>","Farm equipment maker Deere's dealers reel from trade war, bad weather","By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - When China announced this week that it had stopped buying U.S. agricultural products and might impose additional tariffs on farm shipments from America, Dave Schmidt braced for another blow to his business.
The Salem, Wisconsin-based dealer of Deere & Co's (N:DE) tractors, planters and combines is grappling with declining sales and higher levels of inventory as farmers have put off equipment purchases in the wake of rain-delayed planting in the Midwest and the yearlong Sino-U.S. trade standoff.
Schmidt says sales at his dealership, in general, declined by as much as 15% in the first half of the year, led by a fall in the demand for large equipment. In a sign of things to come, early orders for planting equipment for next season's soybean and corn crops are down up to 25%.
He is not alone. Half a dozen dealers of Deere's agriculture equipment across the Midwest shared similar accounts in interviews with Reuters. One of those dealers, in Geneseo, Illinois, said sales at his dealership were down 50% so far this year from the same period last year.
This is a worrying sign for Deere, which gets nearly 60% of its sales from the United States and Canada. The Moline, Illinois-based company is expected to report lower sales at its agriculture & turf segment when it reports its third-quarter earnings on Aug. 16.
The segment, which accounts for the bulk of the company's sales, is expected to report quarterly sales of $6.24 billion, compared with $6.29 billion a year ago, according to Refinitiv IBES' average analyst estimate.
Overall, Deere is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.88 per share, compared with $2.78 a share in the corresponding period last year. Revenue for the July quarter is forecast to come in at $9.40 billion, up from $9.29 billion last year.
In May, Deere slashed its full-year profit and sales outlook, blaming the U.S. trade war with China for weak demand for its farm machines.
The company's shares, however, have gained a little over 14% since its last earnings report on hopes that a rally in corn prices would encourage farmers to buy new equipment.
But dealers are not so sanguine.
""We are not expecting demand for planting equipment to come back up this year,"" Schmidt said. ""We might see more repair and upgrading of the existing equipment.""
Deere has downgraded the estimates for U.S. principal crop cash receipts this year, an important indicator for equipment demand, citing China's retaliatory tariffs on American imports, which have slashed exports earnings of American farmers.
China imported $9.1 billion of U.S. farm produce in 2018, down from $19.5 billion in 2017, according to the American Farm Bureau, the largest farm industry group in the country.
U.S. shipments to China of soybeans, the country's most valuable farm export, sank to a 16-year low last year as the Asian nation mostly shifted purchases to Brazil, leaving American farmers with surplus stocks. U.S. soy prices are down 18% since March 2018, when President Donald Trump launched a tariff war on China and other countries.
Deere rival CNH Industrial (N:CNHI) last week said the shift has driven up its order book for tractors and combines in South America, particularly in Brazil.
A record-wet spring has devastated a wide swath of the U.S. farm belt and inflicted more economic pain on soybean and corn producers, particularly those whose fields were too wet to ever plant, dampening hopes of an improvement in farm income and equipment sales.
HIGHER INVENTORY, PRODUCTION CUTS
To compensate farmers for the market loss due to the trade war, the Trump administration has committed as much as $28 billion in federal aid. The latest tranche of the aid will likely begin to be paid out later this month.
The bailout money, however, is not expected to lift equipment sales.
""We are yet to feel most of the effects of too much water and the lower prices,"" said Paul Gilsinger, a Deere dealer in Knox, Indiana. ""In the second half of the year, demand could slow down further.""
To prevent a supply glut, U.S. agricultural machine maker AGCO Corp (N:AGCO) and CNH have slashed production to keep inventory in line with retail demand.
A similar concern prompted Deere to cut production by 20% at two of its large factories in North America.
Yet, Gilsinger expects to be saddled with this year's inventory next year. To move used machinery, he is offering waivers on interest on equipment financing.
Schmidt's dealership has been running a similar incentive program. Yet, the inventory turnover ratio for used tractors has doubled, he said.
Adding to the worry, dealers are also encountering an increase in payment delays.
""When you get into a slowdown, it takes a while for demand to build back up,"" Schmidt said. ""These things don't change on a dime."""

470,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 12:42PM ET</span>",Hong Kong airport on alert ahead of fresh wave of protests,"By Noah Sin and Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's protests are hitting its economy, the city's leader Carrie Lam said on Friday, echoing warnings from business leaders including powerful local property developers, as about 1,000 mostly young activists occupied the airport arrivals hall. 
China, whose rule over the city is being challenged by the protests, meanwhile demanded Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) suspend staff involved in the demonstrations. One of its pilots was arrested last week. 
The pair of warnings -- one aimed at residents planning more marches still and the other at a business emblematic of the city's colonial past -- mark a toughening stance by authorities as they grapple with Hong Kong's deepest crisis in decades. 
Flanked by business leaders, Chief Executive Lam told reporters that companies in the Asian financial hub were ""very worried"" about the economic fallout from the protests, which began in June and have become increasingly violent. 
""We have had two months of political dispute,"" she said after meeting business representatives and senior officials, warning that a downturn ""is coming very quickly"". 
""Some people have described it as coming like a tsunami ... the economic recovery will take a long time,"" Lam said. 
What started as an angry response to a now-suspended measure for criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in China has rapidly broadened to encompass calls for more democracy, Lam's resignation, and even keeping out mainland tourists.
The protests represent a populist challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, just as an escalating trade war between China and the United States also hammers Hong Kong's economy.
CATHAY WARNING
China's warning on Cathay, saying crew who engaged in the protests pose a threat to safety and should be suspended from staffing flights to the mainland, follows the pilot's arrest and tumbling bookings.
Cathay has said it is taking the directive seriously, though when asked about staff participating in protests last week, Chairman John Slosar said the company ""wouldn't dream"" of telling staff ""what to think about something"".
Dozens of other Hong Kong companies have warned of faltering earnings, while city officials caution daily that the protests are hurting livelihoods and could help trigger a recession.
Lam said the city's Executive Council would next week resume meetings suspended in mid-June to prepare a policy response that would consider ""daring measures"".
""For Hong Kong's society to recover the foundation is the same (as that of the economy),"" she said. ""We must stop the widespread violence.""
She urged landlords to ease rents on hard-pressed retailers, but dismissed demands for an inquiry into police behavior at demonstrations.
""I disagree with (establishing) an independent inquiry that targets police work,"" she said. ""I don't think we should just sort of make concessions in order to silence the violent protesters."" 
'BROKEN CITY'
Young people have been at the forefront of the protests, worried about China encroaching on Hong Kong's freedoms but also concerned with issues such as sky-high living costs and what many see as an unfair housing policy favoring the wealthy. 
Soaring property prices have pushed up rents and had a knock-on effect on prices of goods and services. Last year, Oxfam said the city's income inequality was at its highest in more than four decades.
Hong Kong's property developers spoke out for the first time on Friday, urging calm in a statement signed by 17 companies, including CK Asset Holdings Ltd (HK:1113), founded by property tycoon Li Ka-shing, the city's richest man.
At the airport, protesters sang ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" from the musical ""Les Miserables"" and chanted: ""Democracy now"" and ""Hong Kongers, add oil!"" — a popular exhortation in Cantonese.
There was no visible police presence. Seeking to engage tourists, activists handed out anti-government leaflets and waved banners in a dozen languages. 
""It will be a peaceful protest as long as the police do not show up,"" Charlotte Lam, 16, told Reuters.
""We have made stickers, banners in over 16 languages, ranging from Japanese to Spanish. We want to spread our message internationally. We are not rioters, we are a group of Hong Kong people fighting for human rights and freedom.""
OLD COP ON THE BEAT 
Marches are planned across Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories over the weekend, where protesters could see a shift in police tactics. 
To help deal with the protests, Hong Kong has recalled from retirement a police commander who oversaw the response to pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014. 
Alan Lau Yip-shing will handle large public events, including activities to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, the government said in a statement.
The escalating violence has already prompted travel warnings from countries including the United States and Australia, although the airport demonstration did not prompt complaints.
""I don't really know what to think about the protest,"" said Joyce, a New Zealander. 

""Right now I just hope it won't delay my flight. But at the same time, as long as you're making a point without making too much trouble, it's OK.""

472,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 12:18PM ET</span>",Bayer soars on report company proposes $8 billion Roundup settlement,"By Jonathan Stempel and Ludwig Burger
NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) has not offered to pay billions of dollars to settle claims in the United States related to the Roundup herbicide, mediator Ken Feinberg said, dismissing a report to that effect which drove its shares as much as 11% higher.
""Bayer has not proposed paying $8 billion to settle all the U.S. Roundup cancer claims. Such a statement is pure fiction,"" Feinberg said in an email on Friday. ""Compensation has not even been discussed in the global mediation discussions.""
Bayer shares, which had shed some of their gains before Feinberg's statement, retreated further and closed up 1.7% at 64.63 euros.
Bayer, which acquired Roundup and other glyphosate-based weedkillers as part of its $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) last year, declined comment on the initial Bloomberg news report and on Feinberg's response.
Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann last week said the company would consider settling with U.S. plaintiffs only on reasonable terms, and if it ""achieves finality of the overall litigation"".
He added at the time the group was ""constructively engaging"" in a court-ordered process with mediator Feinberg on the cases heard in federal court. Most of the pending cases, however, have been filed with U.S. state courts.
Feinberg added that any efforts by Bayer toward a comprehensive settlement were tied in with the mediation proceedings overseen by him. ""These are all part of the same mediation process."" 
Bayer shares have lost more than a third of their value, or roughly 30 billion euros ($34 billion), since last August when a California jury in the first such lawsuit found Monsanto should have warned of the alleged cancer risks from Roundup.
HIGH EXPECTATIONS 
The German drugs and pesticides company has engaged in negotiations with plaintiffs' lawyers, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
""The problem is, how do you get the plaintiffs to climb down from their very high expectations? None of the jury verdicts so far have been favorable for Bayer,"" one of the sources said, adding that talks were focused on basic questions such as how to handle potential future claims.
Bayer said on Friday that the next U.S. glyphosate lawsuit initially scheduled to be heard in St. Louis, Missouri, this month would be postponed to Jan. 27, 2020, and that a following St. Louis case slated for September had also been postponed.
The German company may benefit from having cases heard in the city where Monsanto was headquartered and where Bayer manages its global seeds business. But Missouri is also known for juries that often hit companies with huge damages.
Bloomberg said the delays had been pursued by Bayer to allow for undisturbed settlement talks.
The initial unfavorable court rulings in the first three glyphosate cases, heard in California, have at times dragged Bayer's market value below what it paid for Monsanto, although the shares are now trading above that level.
The company, which says regulators and extensive research have found glyphosate to be safe, has previously said it was banking on U.S. appeals courts to reverse or tone down three initial court rulings that have so far awarded tens of millions of dollars to each plaintiff.
Bloomberg cited three sources familiar with the discussions as saying Bayer's lawyers were seeking an accord to resolve all current and future cases. Talks over cases that have yet to be filed were particularly tricky, the report added.
While Bayer has indicated it could pay $6-$8 billion, plaintiffs' lawyers want more than $10 billion to drop their claims, the report said. 
An estimate of a $20 billion hit from the litigation has previously been reflected in the share price, while a likely litigation settlement liability was in the mid single-digit billion dollar range, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts said in note.
They kept a ""neutral"" rating on the stock, citing uncertainty over Bayer's fortunes in the appeals process - with the first appeals verdict expected by the end of the year - and whether a settlement could be achieved before that. 

The number of U.S. plaintiffs blaming Roundup and other glyphosate-based weedkillers for cancer had continued to rise by 5,000 to 18,400, Bayer said last week.

DONGGUAN, China/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies unveiled on Friday its proprietary operating system for smartphones and other devices, as U.S. trade restrictions imposed in May threaten to cut the Chinese firm's access to U.S. technologies such as Android.
Huawei said that for now it would stick to using Google's Android for smartphones, and the new software will be gradually rolled out to support devices such as smartwatches, speakers and virtual reality gadgets.
The new OS is part of Huawei's attempt to develop its own technologies from chips to software to reduce its reliance on U.S. firms amid an intensifying U.S.-China trade war. 
President Donald Trump said on Friday that the United States was not going to do business with Huawei but that could change if there was a trade deal.
Huawei had previously given little information about the software, fueling speculation about how quickly or effectively it could find an alternative to the Android system. 
""Harmony OS is completely different from Android and iOS,"" said Richard Yu, head of Huawei's consumer business group referring to operating systems developed by Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
""You can develop your apps once, then flexibly deploy them across a range of different devices,"" he told a developers' conference held in Dongguan in southern China, where Huawei has built a lavish new campus modeled on European towns.
President Trump's administration has warned that Huawei could be a vehicle for Chinese espionage and put the company on a so-called ""entity list"", meaning that U.S. corporations that conduct business with the telecoms giant now require special licenses to do so.
Huawei's Yu said the company has no updated knowledge on whether it can continue to use Android. 
ATTRACTING DEVELOPERS
Huawei is not the first major tech company seeking to develop a robust ecosystem around its own software. Its bigger rival Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) has been using its own operating system called Tizen in smartwatches and televisions. 
But attempts by the South Korean firm to grow Tizen to challenge Android in smartphones have been thwarted by lack of support from developers.
Marko Yang, an investor in developer studios who attended the conference, however, said he believed the size of the Chinese market would help Huawei overcome such a problem. Huawei says there are more than 800,000 developers in its product ecosystem.
""The Chinese market is huge, there are many users and they have many demands, and solving their demands will result in many apps, products, and when this happens it will, from the periphery, create a core ecosystem, and the Chinese market will go on to spur the overseas market,"" Yang said.
Yu also said in order to attract developers, it was willing to cut its fee intake from app developers working for Harmony to as low as 10%-15%. Apple and Google take a 30% cut for revenue generated through their app stores.
Zhang Ping'an, president of Huawei consumer cloud service, told a briefing with Chinese media that Huawei plans to invest $1 billion to support developers, and 80% of that would be spent overseas. Huawei confirmed his comment to Reuters and said the timeframe is within 5 years. 
A new ""smart screen"", or connected television product, to be unveiled on Saturday will be the first product using Harmony, called Hongmeng in Chinese, Huawei said. It also has roll-out plans for the OS in other devices till 2022. 
Yu said Harmony will be open source and aims to be safer and more efficient than existing ones in the market. 
NOT AN ANDROID RIVAL
More than 4,000 Huawei developers have been working on Harmony, according to Yu. People familiar with its development at Huawei said Harmony was not being developed to rival Android, but was more like Google's Fuchsia - an open source OS being developed at the American firm for gadgets that could include everything from smartphones to Internet-of-Things devices. 
Yu mentioned Google’s Fuchsia multiple times during his speech, which was made to thousands of attendees in a basketball stadium in the city. VIP tickets for the conference were priced upwards of 4,298 yuan ($608.90). 
He also said it would be difficult for Huawei to meet its previous goal of becoming the world's biggest smartphone maker by shipments this year due to the U.S. curbs imposed in May, but expects to be able to keep the No.2 spot. 

The company would have been able to ship 300 million smartphones this year without such restrictions. It shipped 118 million units in the first-half.

German motor vehicle authority KBA had discovered cheating software fitted to Mercedes-Benz C-Class and E-Class vehicles and ordered the carmaker to recall 280,000 vehicles, Spiegel said.
A fine of up to 5,000 euros per vehicle is being considered by the Stuttgart prosecutor, the magazine said.
A spokesman for the prosecutor's office said the investigation was ongoing and would not be concluded before year-end.
Daimler declined to comment while the investigation was under way.
In May 2017, German prosecutors searched Daimler offices as part of a fraud inquiry related to possible manipulation of exhaust gas after-treatment in diesel cars.
Daimler also faces regulatory scrutiny by United States authorities. In February 2016 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asked Mercedes-Benz to explain emissions levels in some of its diesel cars.
Prosecutors in Germany have used administrative orders to impose fines on Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Audi and Porsche, blaming senior management for oversight lapses which allowed emissions cheating to take place.

Beijing halted its purchases of U.S. farming goods on Monday, while the U.S. officially declared China a currency manipulator after China pegged its yuan below 7 to the dollar.

None of the Wall Street brokerages who cover the stock changed their recommendation on Uber, and the fall was almost equivalent to the 8% surge in the company's shares after Lyft's numbers on Thursday. 
Revenue at the company, however, grew just 14% compared to an almost 150% jump in costs, leaving the firm with a more than $5 billion loss, its biggest ever.

Until the broader market turbulence of the past week, Uber shares were recovering solidly from a rough start to their life on the New York Stock Exchange. 
That reflected continuing doubts over the solidity of the company's long-term business model. But of the 33 brokerages now covering the stock, 21 have ""buy"" or higher ratings, 11 are on ""hold"" and just one has a ""sell"" rating.
On Friday, two reduced their price target for the stock while another two raised. 
Several brokerages pointed to comments by Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi that the price war in the ride-hailing business was easing and that both Lyft and Uber were laying out a path to future profits.

""Near term, bears pointing to the 'chicken and the egg' problem (profits or growth?) – may carry the day... but we like bulls' chances longer term as they took another step on the path to profitability,"" Evercore analysts said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings' (L:HSBA) Greater China Chief Executive Helen Wong is leaving, a bank spokeswoman said on Friday, the second senior departure this week after the ousting of group CEO John Flint.
Wong has decided to leave to pursue an external opportunity, the spokeswoman said, adding that her role will be dropped and the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, would be run by the respective country heads.
Greater China is HSBC's biggest profit driver, but the banking sector outlook in the region has been clouded by the tit-for-tat tariff war between China and the United States, as well as unrest in Hong Kong.
Flint and Wong's exit also follows weeks of adverse Chinese media coverage over HSBC's role in the arrest of Huawei finance chief Meng Wanzhou.
Wong, who joined HSBC in 1992 and rose to become its China CEO before being given the newly created role of Greater China chief in 2015, did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to her official email.
The HSBC spokeswoman said Wong's resignation was submitted at the end of July and there was no connection between her decision and Flint's departure.
Flint's ousting was announced on Monday in a move that the chairman of Europe's biggest bank said was needed to speed progress in priority areas.
""Our growth strategy in China is unchanged. HSBC has been steadfast in its commitment to China for over 150 years. We will continue to support China's growth and economic prosperity going forward,"" the HSBC spokeswoman said.
Last month HSBC also announced the departure of the head of its U.S. business, Patrick Burke, after three decades with the bank. Burke will be replaced by Citigroup's (N:C) Michael Roberts."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair's (I:RYA) directly employed pilots in Ireland on Friday voted in favor of industrial action unless pay demands are met swiftly, with Spanish pilots also threatening to join growing unrest at the airline.
Europe's largest budget airline suffered a number of strikes last year by pilots and cabin crew, forcing it to cancel hundreds of flights and hitting profit after a rocky start to its move to recognize trade unions for the first time.
Ryanair managed to quell the disputes by reaching deals with many unions in Europe on pay and allowances, but it has yet to move beyond recognition agreements with others and further angered unions by telling staff 10 days ago that it had 900 more pilots and crew than it needed.
Members of Ryanair's British pilots union voted this week to follow Portuguese cabin crew to the picket line, with two strikes planned from Aug. 22. The action in Ireland was backed by 94% of those who cast a ballot among the 180 eligible pilots.
About a quarter of Ryanair's 350 pilots in its home market staged a series of one-day strikes a year ago before concerns on transfers and promotions were settled, but the Forsa/IALPA trade union said the airline has stalled on talks since pay demands were submitted in late March.
""They (pilots) feel they have been forced into contemplating potentially disruptive industrial action by a company that seems either unwilling or unable to negotiate in a professional and constructive manner,"" Forsa's assistant general secretary, Ian McDonnell, said in a statement.
STRIKE NOTICE
""At this stage, only a substantive counter-proposal, which properly addresses all areas of our claim, will be enough to prevent us serving notice of industrial action next week.""
The union is required to give at least one week's notice before any strike. 
Ryanair said Forsa should continue with the mediation process that has been under way for more than a year instead of threatening what it described as ""ill-timed industrial action"". 
The company's main pilots union in Spain will vote in the coming days on possible industrial action, including strikes, in direct response to planned job cuts, the local SEPLA trade union said.
The airline cited delays in deliveries of Boeing's (N:BA) grounded 737 MAX jet as the reason for halving growth plans for next year. SEPLA said Ryanair has threatened to fire 100 pilots in Spain as part of those plans.
""Our group is nervous and fed up with the continued abuse by Ryanair,"" SEPLA said in a statement late on Thursday. ""We are going to show them that we are willing to do everything possible to avoid these unnecessary dismissals.""
In response, a spokeswoman for Ryanair reiterated that consultations are taking place with staff at bases affected by the planned winter closures.
Analysts at Goodbody Stockbrokers said that investor concern over an increasingly coordinated union response across Europe will be heightened by the possible action in Spain. 

Ryanair shares were down 2.4 percent in early afternoon trade at 9.01 euros, their lowest in more than four-and-a-half years.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 09:51AM ET</span>",Turkish fund seen favorite to take over British Steel,"By Barbara Lewis and Clara Denina
LONDON (Reuters) - The British government is set to announce a preferred bid for British Steel within days, with a Turkish fund seen as the front-runner, as it scrambles to save thousands of jobs, industry sources said.
The country's second largest steelmaker was put into compulsory liquidation on May 22 after Greybull Capital, which bought the company from Tata Steel for one pound three years ago, failed to secure funding to continue operating it.
Closure of the company, which produces high-margin, long steel products used in construction and rail networks, would jeopardize 5,000 jobs in Scunthorpe, northern England, and a further 20,000 jobs in the supply chain.
A government announcement is expected early next week, one of the sources said.
The winning bidder will have two weeks to perform due diligence, a second source said. Previous deadlines have been flexible, however.
The government office handling the liquidation said talks continued but declined to comment on timing and bidders.
A Turkish consortium led by military pension fund Oyak, which is also the largest shareholder in steelmaker Erdemir, is the front-runner, four industry sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Oyak declined to comment.
Erdemir has dismissed media reports that said it was interested in British Steel.
Liberty House, part of GFG Alliance, a privately-held conglomerate led by Sanjeev Gupta, is one of the other two companies in the running for now, two of the sources said.
Liberty House had no immediate comment.
Greybull, which had wanted to keep European operations that are part of British Steel, has been ruled out, two sources said.
Greybull declined to comment.
Industry sources previously said British Steel was likely to be split up because of the amounts of capital needed after decades of under-investment.
They said any deal to take on the whole business would depend on government funding.
The government has in principle agreed to provide aid to different bidders depending on their respective plans, the first source said.
The government under former prime minister Theresa May was willing to respect European Union state aid rules that prevent a government propping up its industry if it creates unfair competition, government sources have said.
Under Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who says Britain will leave the bloc with or without a deal at the end of October, the mood has hardened.
The EU has been at odds with Turkish steelmakers as it debates safeguards to protect its industry from the impact of U.S. trade tariffs.
The tariffs have pushed surplus steel into Europe, especially from Turkey, which has overtaken China as the EU's biggest foreign steel supplier.
Turkey, whose economy is in recession, is likely to suffer from a no-deal British exit from the EU because it is part of an EU customs union and would lose open access to the British market.
A spokesman for Britain's Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department said the government would ""leave no stone unturned"" to achieve a good solution."

The company now expects costs for the year of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion after-tax, compared with $1 billion to $1.4 billion seen earlier.
The San Francisco-based utility filed for bankruptcy this past January, citing potential liabilities of more than $30 billion stemming from the wildfires.
The forecast includes about $1.51 billion to $1.48 billion in costs for the 2017 Northern California wildfires and $1.61 billion to $1.58 billion related to the 2018 Camp Fire blaze.
The Camp Fire wildfire erupted in November of 2018, destroyed nearly 19,000 homes and killed 85 - making it the deadliest single wildfire in California history.
In May, state fire investigators determined that PG&E transmission lines caused the fire.
The company on Friday reported a wider net loss attributable to shareholders of $2.55 billion or $4.83 per share in the quarter ended June 30, from $984 million or $1.91 per share, a year earlier. (https:// The loss was mainly from a $3.9 billion pre-tax charge for estimated third-party claims related to the wildfires.

The loss included a $3.9 billion pre-tax charge for estimated claims related to the fires, the company said in a statement Friday. PG&E, which did not provide guidance for the year, filed for Chapter 11 in January facing an estimated $30 billion in liabilities from blazes tied to its equipment.
Investors largely shrugged off the loss, and PG&E shares were little changed before the start of regular trading on Wall Street. The company’s adjusted operating earnings per share of $1.10 beat the average analyst estimate by 11 cents.
“We recognize we are operating from a deficit when it comes to public trust, and to regain that trust, we must sustain excellent operational performance day after day, month after month, year after year,” PG&E Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson said in the statement.
The results come on the day that PG&E and other parties are due to submit recommendations to the judge overseeing the company’s Chapter 11 proceedings on how to evaluate alternative restructuring proposals.
A group of creditors including Pacific Investment Management Co. and Elliott Management Corp. are pushing to take control of PG&E. The bondholders have put forward a $31 billion proposal that could give them control of 95% of PG&E’s stock. On Thursday, meanwhile, hedge funds Knighthead Capital Management and Abrams Capital Management, which together own about 7.8% of the company, filed plans with regulators to raise $15 billion of equity to bolster PG&E’s plans to emerge from bankruptcy.
After it exits bankruptcy, PG&E has agreed to make a $4.8 billion initial contribution to a $21 billion state wildfire fund. It will help utilities pay for future claims from wildfires tied to their equipment."

489,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 07:02AM ET</span>",StockBeat: European Markets Hit by Italy's Latest Political Crisis,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Italy’s banks bore the brunt of its latest political crisis early Friday, falling by between 2.2% and 6.5% as the euro zone’s third-largest economy lurched towards new elections.
The FTSE MIB, predictably, led European markets lower, falling 2.2% by 5:10 AM ET (0910 GMT). The prospect of a new, hard-right government that could reignite the smoldering dispute over the country’s – and the euro zone’s – debt and budgetary policy was also shocking enough to drag Spain’s IBEX 35 down 1.0% and Germany’s Dax down 0.6%.
The benchmark Stoxx 600, meanwhile, fell 0.4% to 373.30, on course for a weekly loss of 1.3%.
To a large degree, the reaction is a function of what is happening in the bond markets, where investors have immediately repriced Italian country risk sharply higher. That translates into a higher implied cost of capital for all Italian companies, reducing their likely return on equity. The yield on the 10-year government bond has risen 25 basis points to 1.79%, its highest since early July, while the infamous 'spread' over the equivalent German bond has widened to 235 basis points, also a six-week high.
While that’s a sharp movement, it still needs to be put in context: the spread was over 310 basis points in November last year when the current government was fighting with Brussels over its budget plans, and over 500 at the height of the euro crisis in 2011.
The movement is both logical and puzzling at the same time. Logical, because opinion polls show that new elections would probably result in a right-wing government dominated by the Lega party of Matteo Salvini, whose anti-immigrant rhetoric and rage against the EU’s constraints on Italy’s budget deficits will be sure to put the country back on a collision course with the eurozone establishment.
But puzzling because, as Oxford Economics analyst Angel Talavera pointed out via Twitter, it’s “the most telegraphed political crisis in history.” Salvini and the Lega have doubled their poll ratings since going into government as the junior partner of the 5 Stars Movement last spring, and Salvini has for months been visibly agitating for new elections to reflect that shift. Markets have had plenty of time to price in this risk, but investors have piled into Italian debt in recent weeks on the hopes of monetary policy easing from the European Central Bank, at a time when yields on many other government bonds have been plummeting below zero.
The newspaper Corriere della Sera reported on Thursday that Salvini’s preference would be for an election on October 13. If the country votes in line with current opinion polls, there is a strong chance that he could form a new government with the hard-right Fratelli d’Italia party, which is closer to the Lega’s thinking on immigration and national sovereignty. That suggests that a new government could be formed – at least by Italian standards – relatively quickly,
With the U.K. on course to leave the EU at the end of October in a disorderly manner, the European Union could be facing two separate and potent threats to its economic and political cohesion at the same time. And this at a time when the euro zone economy is fast going into reverse under the influence of the U.S.-China trade conflict: Germany, France and the Netherlands all produced dismal industrial production figures for June this week.
While the history of the EU suggests that it will, ultimately, rise to those challenges, the short-term uncertainty looks highly likely to weigh on all European assets in the meantime."
490,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 07:01AM ET</span>","Uber loses $5 billion, misses Wall Street targets despite easing price war","By Alexandria Sage and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) reported a record $5.2 billion loss and revenue that fell short of Wall Street targets on Thursday as growth in its core ride-hailing business slowed, sending its shares down 6%.
The company said a price war in the United States was easing and that an important measure of profitability topped its target, but slowing revenue growth raised questions about Uber's ability to expand and fend off competition.
""Losses are widening and the competition is cut-throat,"" said Haris Anwar, analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com. ""What's sapping investor confidence and hitting its stock hard after this report is the absence of a clear path to grow revenue and cut costs.""
Uber's second-quarter net loss, widening from a loss of $878 million a year earlier, included $3.9 billion of stock-based compensation expenses related to its IPO earlier this year and nearly $300 million in ""driver appreciation"" related to the stock sale.
The report caught investors off guard in part because Uber's smaller rival  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) on Wednesday had raised revenue expectations and described an easing price war.
Uber stock had risen more than 8% and Lyft had gained 3% during the day. Following Uber's report, its shares fell 6% and Lyft dropped nearly 2%.
Uber reported that revenue growth slowed to 14% to $3.2 billion and fell short of the average analyst estimate of $3.36 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company's core business, ride-hailing, grew revenue only 2% to $2.3 billion. Food delivery Uber Eats grew 72% to $595 million.
Gross bookings, a measure of total value of car rides, scooter and bicycle trips, food deliveries and other services before payments to drivers, restaurants and other expenses, rose 31% from a year earlier to $15.76 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $15.80 billion.
At the same time, Uber is keeping less money per car ride. The amount passengers spent on trips rose 20% while the amount Uber kept after paying its drivers increased just 4%.
Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said in a press call the competitive environment was starting to rationalize and had been ""progressively improving"" since the first quarter.
This year would be the peak for investment and losses would lessen in 2020 and 2021, he said.
Lyft on Wednesday said pricing had become ""more rational"", meaning the company should spend less on promotions and incentives to win market share. It raised its revenue outlook.
Both the companies have historically relied on subsidization to attract riders and have been spending heavily to expand services into areas such as self-driving technology for Lyft and food delivery for Uber.
Uber's costs rose 147% to $8.65 billion in the quarter, including a sharp rise in spending for research and development.
""While we will continue to invest aggressively in growth, we also want it to be healthy growth, and this quarter we made good progress in that direction,"" Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai said in a statement.
The adjusted loss before items including interest, tax, and stock-based compensation more than doubled to $656 million but was better than the company expected, Uber said. It also topped Wall Street targets of a $996 million loss.
Gross bookings for the year would be $65 billion to $67 billion, it said, in line with Wall Street's target of $65.9 billion.
The company, which has not yet made clear whether it will make a profit, is trying to convince investors that growth will come not only from its ride services, but also from other logistics and food delivery services.
Uber said its monthly active users rose to 99 million globally, from 93 million at the end of the first quarter and 76 million a year earlier."

MILAN (Reuters) - Shares in Italian infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) rose more than 2% on Friday as a possible breakdown in the government was seen as lessening the prospect it could lose its lucrative motorway concession. 
The stock bucked a sinking trend on Milan's main equity index, accompanied by rising sovereign bond yields, the morning after Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini called for an early election.
Atlantia's concession to operate around 3,000 km of motorways, about half the Italian network, has been under threat from Salvini's coalition partner 5-Star since a bridge it operated in Italy collapsed last year, killing 43 people.
Salvini, leader of the far-right League, pulled the plug on the government on Thursday, diluting that threat to a business unit which brings in a third of Atlantia's core profit.
""Atlantia is rising because the 5-Star have always supported revoking the concession, and the government crisis blows this away,"" a Milan-based trader said. 
According to financial analyst Marco Opipari at broker Fidentiis, the stock was boosted by prospects that the 5-Star would not be part of a new government.
""If the government resigns, the procedure for revoking the concession would be interrupted, and since it would be unlikely that 5-Star would participate in a new executive, it would be very plausible that this procedure would not be reopened,"" Opipari said.
The infrastructure group and its top managers are under investigation for the bridge collapse, together with several officials of Italy's transport ministry. 
Atlantia has always denied any wrongdoing, saying regular, state-supervised inspections had indicated the viaduct was safe.
""The risks linked to the outcome of the civil and criminal trial on the collapse of the Genoa bridge would remain, but there is no doubt that Atlantia's position would be greatly favored in its relations with a government without the 5-Star,"" Opipari added 
Atlantia declined comment. 
FIRST ANNIVERSARY
During a fractious 14 months in government, 5-Star has accused the League of being too soft on Atlantia.
A ceremony is due to take place in Genoa on Aug. 14 to mark the first anniversary of the collapse of the Morandi bridge, a disaster that shocked the country and severed a key connection between the port city and southern France. 
5-Star has more parliamentary seats than the League, but polls say its partner now enjoys twice as much voter support.
Atlantia, owned by the Benetton business dynasty, may also be less likely to invest in the rescue of struggling airline Alitalia [CAITLA.UL], the trader added.
Pumping money into Alitalia, which successive Italian governments have tried and failed to return to profit, could have been seen by Atlantia as a means of improving its relationship with Rome, analysts said. 
Atlantia has said it would be in its own interest to invest in Alitalia because it operates Rome's main airport Fiumicino, which could suffer if the airline goes belly-up.

Italy's blue-chip index (FTMIB) was down 2.3% by 0950 GMT, while Atlantia shares were up 2.2% at 23.98 euros, having risen more than 3% after the market open.

494,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 06:26AM ET</span>",Caught in the trade war: resurgent yen poses risk for Japan Inc,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Yuri Harada
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Inc is caught in the crossfire of the trade war between the United States and China, as a resurgent yen threatens to sap profits and complicate the economic outlook.
Worsening trade friction between the world's two largest economies has reduced investor appetite for risk and boosted assets perceived to be safer bets, such as gold and the yen .
Japan's currency is now near its firmest level in eight months against the U.S. dollar, and exporters in the world's third-largest economy are preparing for pain.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) reported its best quarter in four years last week, but cut its full-year outlook on the yen.
""We're going to be affected by a stronger yen this year, so to offset this as much as possible we have been taking extra measures to reduce fixed costs and cut down on expenses,"" Kenta Kon, a Toyota manager, told a briefing last week.
Japanese exporters regularly hedge against currency fluctuations, but a strengthening yen still hurts them because it makes their electronic appliances, semiconductors and cars more expensive overseas. It also decreases the value of overseas earnings when they are brought home.
The economy expanded at an annualized 1.8% in the second quarter, data showed on Friday, beating expectations of a 0.4% increase. Robust household consumption and business investment offset the hit to exports, which fell 0.1%.
But the outlook for exports could be further complicated as firms are saddled with a strengthening yen.
""The escalating U.S.-China trade war and the yen's rise are negative factors for Japan's economy,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""There's a pretty good chance the timing of a pick-up in exports could be delayed,"" he added.
Toyota expects the stronger yen to knock 350 billion yen ($3.3 billion) from its operating profit in the current financial year, roughly double its previous forecast and a big increase from last year's 50 billion yen impact.
The automaker, Japan's largest company by revenue and market value, expects the yen to average around 106 to the U.S. dollar in the current financial year, against a previous assumption of 110 yen.
(GRAPHIC - How yen moves impact Toyota's profitability: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YHLUL7)
'NO MAGIC SOLUTION'
Other exporters have signaled the possibility of currency pain. Sony Corp (T:6758) now expects the yen to average 108 yen this year, from its previous forecast of 110.
""There's no magic solution,"" Toshiba Corp (T:6502) Chief Financial Officer Masayoshi Hirata told reporters this week, referring to the yen. ""If the yen continues to appreciate we'll have to further improve our cost efficiencies,"" he said.
Honda Motor Co (T:7267), Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269) and Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) have also flagged the possibility of a cut to profit forecasts if the yen's climb continues.
Honda, which relies on the United States for about a quarter of its vehicle sales, last week posted a 16% percent drop in first-quarter profit, partially hit by the yen.
The currency is an additional problem for automakers already facing easing demand in many markets, said Chris Richter, senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA.
""Many Japanese automakers are going to have to adjust their profit forecasts simply because things are bad for them in vehicle markets, and the forex issue is the icing on the cake,"" he said.
The yen appreciating beyond 105 to the dollar is often seen by automakers as determining whether the currency will mean a significant hit to profit.
The currency was at 105.93 to the dollar on Friday.
""Given the current uncertainty about what will happen between the United States and China, along with other issues, it's difficult to revise our forecasts at the moment,"" Suzuki managing officer Masahiko Nagao told a briefing this week.
""But we may have to revisit them later in the year, once we have a better idea,"" he added.
TRADE WAR
Some investors and economists worry that the U.S.-China trade war has entered a new phase that will do even more damage to the global economy. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he will impose more tariffs on Chinese imports from Sept. 1.
China this week let the yuan slide to an 11-year low, prompting the U.S. Treasury Department to label Beijing a currency manipulator. The trade war has brought forward the next U.S. recession, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters.
So far, economists say there are no signs that the uncertainty over the trade war has prompted Japanese firms to rein in investment spending.
Still, with global demand cooling, a resurgent yen is hardly what Japan's exporters - or the economy - need.
""The outlook for Japan's economy is highly uncertain. My main scenario is that Japan can avert a full-blown economic downturn,"" said Dai-ichi Life's Shinke.
""But the risk is clearly tilted to the downside,"" he said."
495,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 05:33AM ET</span>",Italy's political turmoil push European shares lower,"(Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday, leading them to post a second straight week of losses, as worries about the stability of Italy's government rattled investors and concerns about Sino-U.S. trade tensions lingered.
Milan's FTMIB index (FTMIB) tumbled 1.6% with Italian banks (FTIT8300) hardest hit after the leader of the ruling League party, Matteo Salvini, pulled his support for the country's governing coalition on Thursday.
Markets have recently been sensitive to political developments in Rome with Italian bond yields jumping each time there were doubts about the soundness of the government.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.2% after recording its best day in almost two months on Thursday, following upbeat trade data from China and a steadying of its currency.
Also weighing on risk appetite was a Bloomberg report, which said that Washington is delaying a decision about licenses for U.S. firms to restart trade with Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], making investors nervous about a ramp-up of bickering in the ongoing trade dispute.
Helping to limit losses on the benchmark was the healthcare sector (SXDP), boosted by  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb), which beat quarterly operating profit forecasts and raised its 2019 sales outlook."
496,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 05:11AM ET</span>",China's builders brace for winter: buy less land as home sales weaken,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese property developers are slowing land purchases and plan to be more selective about where they build, as sales soften from tightening measures and a deteriorating economic outlook.
Market confidence has been hit by the Sino-U.S. trade war and buyers continue to be wary even though there have been recent signs of a loosening in policy in certain cities. A dearth of construction could add unexpected pressure on the economy in 2020.
Contract sales by the top 100 Chinese developers in July posted a 29% decline from June, data from research firm CRIC showed, while the value of land sold in the 300 cities it tracks dropped 16.6%. Land premiums also softened 6 percentage points to 13% in July, returning to levels seen at the start of the year.
After two years of breakneck growth, China's property market hit a downturn in the second half of last year following a series of cooling measures by the government to contain prices. Beijing recently dashed hopes it would loosen its grip on those measures to stabilize the economy, saying it will not use the property market as a form of short-term stimulus.
An official of Shanghai-based property developer CIFI Holdings said the company, one of the country's top 20, will buy less land for the rest of the year than originally planned.
""When sales are not so optimistic, buying less land would be a new norm for the industry,"" he said. The official declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media.
Developers usually spend 30% to 40% of their contracted sales during the period to replenish land.
Guangzhou R&F Properties, whose sales in the first seven months gained 5% on the year, a significant drop from 51% growth a year earlier, said in an internal document last week it would stop land purchases altogether in the second half, according to local media.
It also asked staff to speed up sales as the figure so far - at 71 billion yuan ($10.1 billion) as of the end of July - was still a distance from the full-year target of 160 billion yuan.
CIFI did not respond to email request for comment. R&F declined to comment.
Large developers usually own landbanks that can last for three years of development. In the first six months this year, the top 50 developers acquired 6.4 percent more new land parcels than a year ago in terms of area, according to CREIS data.
Picking land parcels strategically is also becoming increasingly important, and difficult. One mid-sized developer said they prefer second- and third-tier cities with less restrictive measures, yet with a net population inflow so that the company can still expect a high turnover.
Analysts expect margins for developers to start to decline from the first half of this year due to rising land costs and housing price caps.
""Given the falling margin trend, we think some companies could lower their 2019 earnings guidance,"" UBS head of China real estate research John Lam said in a research report.
He expected most companies would keep their 2019 sales targets but become more prudent in setting 2020 sales growth outlooks amid the current tight liquidity conditions.
Beijing looks likely to keep a tight grip on credit to avoid bubble risk, such as restricting developers from issuing bonds to fund land acquisitions.
The tight financing conditions have been especially tough for smaller builders. Nearly 300 property developers had filed for bankruptcy this year by the end of July, the Securities Daily reported, citing court filings. Most of the companies were small developers focusing on third and fourth tier cities.
The figure is around 50% higher than the year before, but is still low compared with 2014 when 2,000 developers went under water, analysts said, adding that it was the intention of the central government to see the sector consolidate. China is estimated to have more than 40,000 developers and most are small and fundamentally weak.
While bankruptcy is not a concern for most of the larger developers, as they have bigger credit lines and can diversify their risks across developments in different cities, they are tapping as many financing channels as they can before the winter arrives.
""We still have quota (for dollar bond issuance) left, but we're worried that next year's quota could be impacted,"" said a CFO of a developer in eastern China."

Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co Ltd (T:8031), which bought a small stake in Beyond Meat in 2016, said it previously planned to partner with the U.S. company to sell plant-based meat alternatives in Japan, but there was no longer such a project.
A Beyond Meat spokeswoman said she could not immediately comment, while a Mitsui spokeswoman declined to give a reason for the change, adding that future expansion in Japan was still possible.
El Segundo, California-based Beyond Meat sells pea-based burgers and sausages at restaurants and in supermarkets, and its shares have surged around 550% since their May IPO on expectations for growing demand for meat alternatives. It has also followed on with a secondary offering, which closed earlier this week. 
The company faces competition from Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods and alternative products from more traditional companies such as  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and Perdue Foods. It has also grappled with production capacity issues and interruptions in the supply of pea protein.

Average Japanese consumers generally eat less meat than Americans and their cuisine features items like tofu, but vegan and vegetarian diets are uncommon.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 02:37AM ET</span>",Apple supplier Japan Display posts tenth straight quarter of net loss,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Cash-strapped Japan Display Inc reported on Friday its tenth consecutive quarterly loss, hit by weak iPhone sales at its biggest client Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), increasing the urgency for the firm to close a proposed bailout with a Chinese group.
The liquid crystal display (LCD) maker for smartphones, which gets more than half of its revenue from Apple, posted a net loss of 83.27 billion yen ($786.53 million) in the April-June quarter, far wider than the 1.77 billion loss a year earlier.
Japan Display, money-losing for the past five years, declined to give a full-year earnings outlook, but has previously warned it cannot guarantee a return to profit this year as demand for smartphone screens stays weak.
Apple said last week sales of the smartphone fell 12% globally to $25.99 billion in the quarter to June, after a 17% drop in the prior quarter.
Japan Display has tapped a group led by Chinese investment firm Harvest Group for an 80 billion yen bailout deal for the screen maker, which includes investments from Apple and Hong Kong-based activist investor Oasis Management.
The Japanese company plans to hold a shareholders' meeting on Sept. 27 to formalize the bailout plan.
The investment, to be completed by August next year at the latest, will give the Chinese group a 49.8% stake in Japan Display, replacing Japanese government-backed fund INCJ as the biggest shareholder.
But it remains unclear whether Japan Display can close the deal by the deadline, as the investment is dependent on certain conditions, such as no intervention by Chinese authorities and no major cuts in orders from Apple.
Analysts say Apple may be ditching LCD screens in favor of thinner, more flexible OLED (organic light-emitting diode) displays as early as next year, an additional blow to the Japanese company whose late shift to OLED screens has already cost it orders from its biggest customer.
Japan Display first agreed on the bailout deal with the Chinese group in April, but was forced to change the structure as some members of the group walked away after making checks on Japan Display's financials.
The investor group was scheduled to hold a joint press conference on Friday, but abruptly canceled it.

During staff meetings this week, Kolmar Korea chairman Yoon Dong-han played a YouTube video that criticized South Korean President Moon Jae-in and praised Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, according to South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo and other local media.
The video by a right-wing political blogger included vulgar language and comments such as ""Abe is definitely a great leader and President Moon Jae-in should be thankful for not getting punched by Abe in the face,"" local media reported.
Kolmar Korea, which is 12.4% directly owned by Japanese cosmetics contract firm Nihon Kolmar, was the most searched word on South Korea's dominant search engine Naver on Friday, and the reports drew angry comments from readers online.
A company spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment. Kolmar Korea's website was down due to heavy traffic.
The company later issued a public apology.
""The purpose of showing this video was to underscore the importance of not reacting emotionally or being deceived, as in the biased content shown,"" it said in a statement.
Kolmar Korea makes cosmetics for brands like Carver Korea, acquired by Unilever in 2017, and Innisfree,  Amorepacific  Corp's (KS:090430) budget brand, according to a company filing."

Robust capital expenditure and private consumption offset the pain from the global slowdown on exports, helping Japan's economy expand an annualized 1.8% in April-June.
But the 16 economists polled by Reuters expect core machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, to have dropped 1.3% in June from the previous month.
The decline would follow a 7.8% slump in May, which was the biggest decline in eight months, and cast doubt on the government's view that robust corporate spending will underpin Japan's recovery.
""Exports and output are weak. Uncertainty over U.S.-China trade frictions is also high, so manufacturers in particular could become cautious of spending,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.

(Reuters) - Chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc said on Thursday it will buy antivirus software maker Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) Corp's enterprise security unit for $10.7 billion in cash to scale up its software business through deals.
Shares of Symantec rose 3.6% and Broadcom 2% in extended trading.
Broadcom last year bought U.S. business software maker CA Inc (NASDAQ:CA) for $18.9 billion and was reportedly in talks to buy infrastructure software company Tibco Software Inc, which was taken private by Vista Equity Partners for $4.3 billion in 2014.
Its push to software came after a failed attempt last year to buy mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc for $117 billion, which was scuttled by the Trump administration, citing national security.
""M&A has played a central role in Broadcom's growth strategy and this transaction represents the next logical step in our strategy,"" Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said.
Through a string of acquisitions, Tan has propelled the chipmaker that was worth just a few billions to a market capitalization of about $108 billion in the 13 years that he has been at the helm.
Broadcom said the Symantec deal is expected to close in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2020 and is subject to regulatory approvals in the United States, European Union and Japan. It plans to raise fresh debt to fund the deal.
Symantec's enterprise security unit offers a mix of security products and services to business and government customers, helping them improve their security, while reducing cost and complexity.
Revenue at the unit, which is being sold to Broadcom, rose 9.9% to $611 million. Analysts on average had expected $564.3 million.
Symantec has been struggling with severe competition from nimbler rivals and sources had told Reuters last month that it walked away from negotiations to sell the entire company to Broadcom over price disagreements.
Several of its top executives, including CEO Greg Clark, have left the company this year, while it is also being investigated by U.S. regulators over an accounting irregularity.
Symantec, which will be left with consumer focused Norton LifeLock business, said it would issue a special dividend of $12 per share in the fourth quarter and buyback additional $1.1 billion worth of shares.
The company, which reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Thursday, said it plans to cut the global workforce by about 7% and will take a charge of about $100 million. It employed more than 11,900 people as of March 29."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc owner has filed a lawsuit against the electric vehicle maker, claiming the company limited the battery range of older vehicles via a software update to avoid a costly recall to fix what plaintiffs allege are defective batteries.
The lawsuit filed on Wednesday in Northern California federal court alleges fraud and seeks class action status for the potentially ""thousands"" of such Model S and X owners around the world who have seen the range of their older-generation batteries suddenly curtailed, some by as much as 40 miles (64 km). 
The lost range has been a hot topic since May on online owner forums, such as TeslaMotorsClub.com, in which many owners detail how their battery range has fallen. Some users bought more expensive models because they offered greater range. They say Tesla took this away with the software update, thereby devaluing the car, limiting the distance they can travel and forcing them to recharge more frequently. 
Plaintiff David Rasmussen's 2014 Model S 85 lost battery capacity equivalent to about 8kWh but was told by Tesla the degradation was normal, the lawsuit says.
A Tesla spokesperson said the company's priority was to deliver the best possible customer experience with the highest regard for safety. 
""A very small percentage of owners of older Model S and Model X vehicles may have noticed a small reduction in range when charging to a maximum state of charge following a software update designed to improve battery longevity,"" Tesla said. 
It added that it was working to mitigate the impact on range for affected owners and ""have been rolling out over-the-air updates to address this issue since last week."" 
The issue first came to light in May. After a Model S caught fire in Hong Kong, Tesla said that out of an overabundance of caution it was revising charge and thermal management settings on Model S and X vehicles via an over-the-air software update. The goal was ""to help further protect the battery and improve battery longevity,"" it said. In June, it said it planned to improve the impact of the software update after some owners complained. 
Some owners who have seen their cars no longer able to charge to 100% have sought redress through arbitration, while at least three have sold their cars, according to Teslamotorsclub.com forum posts. Others have disabled their Wi-Fi to avoid any software updates that could affect their range.
""Under the guise of 'safety' and increasing the 'longevity' of the batteries of the Class Vehicles, Tesla fraudulently manipulated its software with the intent to avoid its duties and legal obligations to customers to fix, repair, or replace the batteries of the Class Vehicles, all of which Tesla knew were defective, yet failed to inform its customers of the defects,"" wrote the lawsuit.
The lawsuit points to a recent spate of Tesla battery fires, and claims that instead of informing its customers about a potential fire risk, the company ""chose to go behind the backs of its customers and use software updates and throttling of the battery to avoid liability.""
In its Vehicle Safety Report published on its website, Tesla says vehicle fires are ""exceptionally rare"" and from 2012 to 2018 there was approximately one Tesla vehicle fire for every 170 million miles traveled. It compared that with data from the National Fire Protection Association and the U.S. Department of Transportation showing a vehicle fire for every 19 million miles traveled in the United States. Those entities measure fires in all vehicles, not just Teslas.
In May, Tesla said its vehicles were 10 times less likely to experience a fire than a gas car. It said that in its investigation of the Hong Kong fire, it found that only a few battery modules were affected and the majority of the battery pack was undamaged. 
One owner, Nick Smith of Orlando, Florida, said in an interview he has been frustrated by poor customer service by Tesla, with sluggish response to his calls and emails and being kept in the dark over the true root of the problem and what will be done to remedy it. 
""It's as if you take your car to the shop and you have a 20 gallon tank but now you have a 10 gallon tank without your knowledge or permission,"" Smith said in an interview. 
Smith's 2013 Model S P85 will no longer charge past 90% following the software update. Tesla told him the loss was due to normal regular battery degradation, he said.

The batteries in question carry an eight-year warranty.

510,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 08:26PM ET</span>","As UK accelerates post-Brexit freeport plans, trade secretary takes lessons from U.S.","By Jonas Ekblom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Britain is accelerating its post-Brexit plans to develop freeports to boost trade, Trade Secretary Liz Truss said on Thursday after meeting with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to discuss similar U.S. projects and a U.S-UK trade deal.
Truss was due to visit the Port of Newark, New Jersey, one of roughly 300 U.S. freeports, on Friday as part of her first overseas trip after taking office two weeks ago. She said freeports could help Britain achieve its goal of displacing Germany to become Europe's largest economy.
The British government announced plans earlier this month to create up to 10 freeports to boost trade and manufacturing by cutting costs and bureaucracy after it leaves the European Union on Oct. 31.
Freeports, also known as free trade zones, are areas where goods or raw materials can be stored or made into finished goods free of customs duties and taxes before being exported again.
Truss told an event hosted by the conservative Heritage Foundation think-tank that the United States was Britain's most important trading partner and London viewed negotiating a free trade agreement with Washington as a top priority.
Truss met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer earlier this week, and with various British businesses such as car maker Jaguar Land Rover Plc, part of Tata Motors Ltd, and telecoms firm BT Group (LON:BT) Plc.
""I think there is a big opportunity to onshore manufacturing in the UK to create those customs zones where we will be able to import and export raw materials into finished goods and create value on our shores,"" Truss said.
The Newark port freeport, home to 39 businesses that include pharmaceutical firms, food importers, auto processors and oil companies, will host Truss for a visit on Friday, said Steve Coleman, a Port Authority spokesperson.
The Newark port is part of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is the third largest port in the United States and the busiest on the U.S. Eastern seaboard.
Britain plans to create a Freeport Advisory Panel to ""turbocharge growth and ensure towns and cities across the UK benefit from Brexit trade opportunities,"" according to a statement on a government website.
While proponents of freeports argue they create new jobs, skeptics say they mainly redistribute economic activity within a given country.

""The U.S. experience is not very illuminating: whilst there are many jobs in the U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones, there is little evidence of how many are net creations,"" the UK Trade Policy Observatory, run by the University of Sussex and Chatham House think-tank, said in a report published earlier this year.

511,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 07:56PM ET</span>",Sarepta says adverse event report for DMD gene therapy erroneously submitted,"(Reuters) -  Sarepta  Therapeutics Inc (O:SRPT) said on Thursday it was informed that an adverse event report was erroneously submitted to the U.S. health regulator regarding an ongoing study of the company's gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
Shares of the company plunged as much as 19% earlier after a notice from the Food and Drug Administration showed a patient in the study was reported to have developed a serious illness. The stock pared losses to close down about 7% after the company's statement.
Sarepta said its investigation indicated the report was not submitted by its employee or the study's principal investigator.
The drug safety monitoring board has recommended the study to continue after a review, the company said in a statement.
The incident, which occurred in February, involved a 7-year-old boy who developed rhabdomyolysis, a serious condition that can lead to complications such as kidney failure. The patient was hospitalized for observation and discharged the following day, with test results returning to baseline, the company said.
The illness was reported in the FDA adverse events database, which on its own cannot determine whether a drug is the cause of a problem, but can signal potential risks that warrant investigation.
The FDA told Reuters that it was looking into the matter and said it does not have additional information on it.
Sarepta said the study involves two arms with one receiving the drug and the other placebo, and the patient could have been on either.
The event is unlikely to be a major concern as there is a possibility that it could have occurred in a patient on placebo, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said.
Analysts also pointed out that rhabdomyolysis is a commonly associated risk with DMD.
In June,  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), which is racing Sarepta to be first to market with a gene therapy for DMD, reported results from a tiny early study of its experimental treatment.
At the time, Pfizer said two of the six patients in its trial experienced side effects that landed them in the hospital, after which Wall Street analysts declared Sarepta was leading the charge to market.
Sarepta already has a drug to treat some types of DMD on the market.
DMD is a rare, genetic disorder that hampers muscle movement mainly in men, affecting one in every 3,500 to 5,000 males. A lack of dystrophin can cause life-threatening damage to the heart, and over time, death, often at a young age."

Uniqlo, owned by Fast Retailing (T:9983), will close the unidentified store soon, the Japanese daily said without citing sources.
Fast Retailing representatives did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
South Korean consumers are boycotting Japanese products from beer to pens in protest over Japan's decision to impose restrictions on exports of key high-tech materials to its Asian neighbor.
Japan cited security concerns for the curbs. The move, however, has also been seen as retaliation after a South Korean court last year ordered Japanese companies to compensate Koreans who were forced to work for Japanese occupiers during World War Two.
Japan has also removed South Korea from a list of favored trading partners.
Uniqlo is one of Japan's more visible brands globally outside the auto and electronics industries. It has close to 190 stores in South Korea where it sells around 140 billion yen ($1.3 billion) of clothes annually, or 6.6% of its revenue."
513,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 05:47PM ET</span>",Stocks - Markets Rally to Claw Back Early-Week Losses,"Investing.com – Stocks shot higher Thursday as China stabilized the value of the yuan and higher oil prices boosted energy stocks.
The big rally ended with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index recovering all of their losses in Monday's drubbing. The Dow finished about 100 points under its Friday close, but it also enjoyed its second 300-point gain in three days.
The S&P 500 finished up 1.88%. The NASDAQ  jumped more than 2.2%, and the Dow added 1.43%.
The market was led by gains in technology and energy shares. But it was difficult to find losers.
All 30 Dow stocks were higher, led by chemical manufacturer Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW),   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM).
Only four stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index were lower, with food giant Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) the loser, down 8.6%.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) was the leader after introducing its new powerful EPYC data-center chip. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unit are already customers along with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cray (NASDAQ:CRAY), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and VMware (NYSE:VMW).
Lastly, just 20 S&P 500 stocks were lower.
Stocks may be pressured Friday by disappointing results from ride-sharing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER). Uber shares fell 4% after hours after reporting a $5.2 billion loss and a miss on revenue for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings of $4.72 a share were lower than the Investing.com estimate of a loss of $2.10, and revenue was $3.17 billion, compared with the estimate of 3.31 billion.
Any giddiness from the big gains on Tuesday and Thursday must also be seen in this context. The major averages hit record highs in mid-to-late July and were drifting lower even before President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would impose 10% tariffs on goods imported from China starting Sept. 1. Even with Thursday's rally, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain about 3% below their July peaks. The US-China trade fight is unresolved. So, continued volatility is a probability for some time.
Chip stocks were among the leaders in the index. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2.7%. 
Interest rates ticked higher, with the US 10-Year Treasury yield moving up to 1.72% from Wednesday's 1.691%.
The 10-year yield has been falling steadily since mid-March as concerns grew around the world about slowing growth and President Trump repeatedly called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates aggressively. The 10-year yield briefly hit a low of 1.595% on Wednesday after the U.S. opened badly, with the Dow falling nearly 600 points before stabilizing.
 
Oil prices moved higher after Saudi Arabia called for ideas on how to shore up the global oil market. The Saudis have been trying to get crude oil to around $70 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 2.8% to $52.54 as barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, added 2.1% to $57.38.
December Gold Futuresdropped back slightly to $1,509.50 an ounce after China held the yuan at 7.04 to the U.S. dollar. China's move seemed intended to reduce the level of tensions in the U.S.-China trade fight. Investing.com columnist Barani Krishnan thinks, however, Thursday may just have been a pause, with gold facing more upward pressure ahead.
Winners and Losers in the S&P 500
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), cybersecurity software company Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), lithium producer   Albemarle   (NYSE:ALB) and oil- and-gas producer Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) were among the top S&P 500 performers Thursday. 
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC),   CenturyLink   (NYSE:CTL), pharmaceutical maker Perrigo (NYSE:PRGO) and the   Fox Corp   Class A (NASDAQ:FOXA) shares were among the worst performing S&P stocks on the day."
514,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 05:45PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. PPI, Core PPI Data on Tap
The Labor Department will release its July producer price index (PPI) at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), with traders keen to get a sense of whether the pace of inflation remains subdued. 
The PPI, which offers clues about the pace of overall inflation, is expected to come in at 0.1% last month, about the same as in May and June. The core PPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is forecast to rise to a rate of 0.3% from 0.2% previously. 
The pace of producer prices has been subdued in recent months suggesting the tariffs on Chinese imports are yet to boost inflation. 
2. Oil Rig Count Rolls In
Traders will look to the latest Baker Hughes rig count data due Friday for clues on crude production activity following an uptick in U.S. production to 12.3 million barrel a day last week. 
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by 6 to 776.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Oil prices found their footing from a recent slump on Thursday, thanks to better-than-expected China trade data. 
3. Pound in Focus as UK GDP Figures, Manufacturing Due
The odds of the U.K. leaving the European Union without a deal have wreaked havoc on the pound of late, and sentiment on the currency is unlikely to improve as economists' forecast that U.K. economic growth fell in the second quarter. 
UK GDP is expected to have slowed to a rate of 0.1% in July, down from 0.3% the prior month, and 1.4% in the second quarter of this year, down from 1.8% a year ago. 
Manufacturing activity, meanwhile, an area bedeviled by cuts in capital spending among UK businesses amid all the Brexit uncertainty, is expected to fall 0.1% in June from a 1.4% rise in May. 
GBP/USD was roughly flat, trading at $1.213 on the day. 
Any sterling rallies ""will be met with very strong opposition,"" says Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities. ""There is no reason for value-hunting in sterling."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 registered its largest one-day percentage gain in about two months on Thursday, with technology shares providing the biggest boost as equities continued to rebound along with bond yields.
All major sectors advanced at least 1%, and the S&P 500 technology index, which was at the heart of the recent sell-off, climbed 2.4%.
The benchmark S&P 500 extended a rebound that began on Wednesday and closed near its high of the day. The index gained 4% from Wednesday's intraday bottom to Thursday's close.
Strategists said stock market futures strengthened heading into the day, and bargain hunters stepped in to snap up beaten-down shares.
""The overnight action was positive. That, along with the bounce back yesterday, gave us a nice tailwind coming into the market today, both for high-frequency traders who were buying the trend and also for bargain hunters who had seen stocks that were on the watchlist come down to a level that looked attractive,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
""So we've seen a lot of the tech names pop after they got hammered.""
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc gained 16.2% after the chipmaker launched its second generation of processor chip and said that it had landed Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) as customers.
 Symantec Corp  (NASDAQ:SYMC) jumped 12.3% after sources said chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc was in advanced talks to buy the cybersecurity company's enterprise business. After the bell, Symantec confirmed the sale.
U.S. economic data pointed to a robust labor market as the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, allaying some worries about the potential for a recession and helping U.S. Treasury yields rise.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 371.12 points, or 1.43%, to 26,378.19, the S&P 500 gained 54.11 points, or 1.88%, to 2,938.09 and the Nasdaq Composite added 176.33 points, or 2.24%, to 8,039.16.
Better-than-expected export numbers out of China also helped offset recent U.S.-China trade war worries, while there was also some improvement in the country's yuan currency, whose slide over the weekend led to Wall Street's worst day so far this year on Monday.
On the down side, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) sank after it pulled its full-year forecast and wrote down the value of several business units by over $1 billion.
 Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) advanced 3.0% after the ride-hailing service raised its annual outlook and hinted at the end of its price war with Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.
Uber, which reported earnings after the bell and has been a high-profile loser since its market launch this year, rose 8.2% during the session. The company reported revenue that missed analysts' estimates, sending its shares down 6.9% after the close.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.69-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

(Reuters) - U.S.-based high-yield junk bond funds posted more than $4 billion of outflows in the week ended Wednesday, the largest weekly cash withdrawals since October 2018, according to Refinitiv's Lipper data, triggered by an escalating trade war between China and the United States.
Investors scrambled into safer U.S.-based money-market funds, which attracted $64.66 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the fifth largest weekly inflow on record since 1992, Lipper said.
Late Sunday, China let the yuan breach the key 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade and announced it was stopping its purchases of U.S. agricultural products, halting a global rally which had pushed benchmark indexes in the United States and China up more than 20% for the year to date.
It was the latest salvo in a brewing trade-turned-currency war between the world's two largest economies.
""Lower rates aren’t good for money market funds, but the flows this week represented a flight to safety,"" said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Lipper. ""Investors were just looking for a good place to hide.""
Roseen said there were ""significant outflows"" for equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this week at -$22 billion, marking their second-largest weekly outflows on record since 1996.
""Interestingly, despite the 10-year Treasury yield closing at 1.71% yesterday - its lowest closing value since November 4, 2016 - authorized participants and ETF investors were net redeemers of taxable bond ETFs at negative $5.7 billion, with the second-largest net redemption occurring in our government-Treasury macro-group at negative $1.6 billion,"" Roseen said.
""Keep in mind that normally there is an inverse relationship between yield and price. The average government-Treasury ETF posted a 1.69% return for the fund-flows week ended August 7, 2019."""

520,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 04:33PM ET</span>",Ashmore’s Massive Bet on PDVSA’s Bond Roiled by Default Concern,"(Bloomberg) -- With talks intensifying over Venezuela’s state oil giant potentially missing a payment in late October on the nation’s only bond not currently in default, Ashmore Group Plc has more at stake than anyone else.
The London-based investment firm holds more than 51% of Petroleos de Venezuela’s 2020 notes, followed by BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and T Rowe Price Group Inc (NASDAQ:TROW)., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ashmore boosted its holdings last year as Nicolas Maduro’s government began defaulting on some $11 billion in debt. The administration has stayed current on those bonds because they were backed by collateral in Houston-based refiner Citgo Holding.
At the beginning, the bet paid off handsomely: PDVSA’s 2020 notes rallied to 96 cents on the dollar in late January from a low of 62 cents in August 2017. But since then, a series of blows have sent prices tumbling. The bonds were quoted Wednesday around 50 cents on the dollar, according to three people familiar with the matter. The bid-ask spread for the notes has been so big that some data providers stopped publishing daily price quotes last month.
The latest setback came Tuesday as the attorney general for Juan Guaido, recognized by the U.S. and more than 50 nations as Venezuela’s rightful leader, signaled that PDVSA may default on the $913 million payment for its 2020 bonds due October 27. That further tainted investors’ views on notes already hit by a U.S. ban on secondary trading and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s decision to reduce the country’s weight in its benchmark bond indexes to zero.
A spokesman at Ashmore didn’t respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. An outside spokeswoman for Ashmore declined to comment, as did spokeswomen at BlackRock and T Rowe.
The three investment firms rank among the five largest reported holders of all PDVSA debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Filings from the first two quarters of the year show Ashmore held about $850 million in face value of the PDVSA 2020 bonds.
In case of a default, bondholders still have a shot at the collateral on the 2020 bonds through 50.1% of Citgo Holding shares. Yet Donald Trump’s executive order Monday complicated that process. Advisers to Guaido and some investors say that the measure would prevent holders of the debt from foreclosing on the shares, setting up a potential legal showdown later this year.
Attorneys at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, which is advising a Venezuela creditor group, have argued the opposite.
“We believe that execution on the collateral securing the 2020 bonds in accordance with their terms remains authorized,” Cleary Gottlieb lawyers led by Paul Marquardt wrote in a report on Wednesday."
521,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>",Negative-yielding bond supply hits all-time high - J.P. Morgan,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The amount of bonds carrying negative yields increased to an all-time peak of $13.2 trillion on Wednesday, up $1.6 trillion or 13.4% from a month earlier in the wake of a dramatic rally in bond markets around the world, J.P. Morgan said on Thursday.
The amount surpassed the previous record high set in July 2016 by $484 billion, J.P. Morgan analysts said.
Investors' stampede into mainly sovereign bonds started a week ago when U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to slap a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports in a bid to pressure Beijing to agree to a trade deal.
On Monday, China responded by letting its currency weaken to 7 yuan per dollar, a level not seen in a decade. Later that day, the U.S. Treasury labeled China as a currency manipulator.
The escalation of the trade conflict between the world's biggest economies spurred bets central banks would take swift action to counter the trade risks to an already softening global economy.
Sixteen of the 21 developed countries J.P. Morgan tracks saw their government debt yields hit record lows over the past month, J.P. Morgan analysts said.
Most of the increase in negative-yielding bonds occurred in Europe. German yields across all maturities, worth $1.2 trillion, have sunk into negative territory.
Negative-yielding euro zone government bonds grew by 15.6% to $5.2 trillion with an average 28 basis-point fall in yields, they said.
More euro zone corporate bonds also crossed into negative yield territory, bringing their total to $1.7 trillion.
Meanwhile, Japanese debt with yields below zero increased by 6.6% or $458 billion to $7.4 trillion on Wednesday, J.P. Morgan said."
522,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 04:29PM ET</span>",Investors Flee Junk Bonds in Droves as Trade War Batters Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Credit investors yanked cash from U.S. high-yield bond funds and added money to investment-grade securities as the global trade war and recession concerns prompted a move away from risky assets.
Investors withdrew $4.07 billion from junk funds for the week ended Aug. 7, according to Refinitiv’s Lipper. It was the biggest outflow since the end of October as the U.S.-China trade war heated up, causing equities to drop and interest rates to rally earlier this week. Investment-grade funds posted inflows of $2.8 billion.
The fund flows underpin a volatile week for risk assets with junk bonds slumping by more than 1% since the start of last week and the S&P 500 suffering its biggest decline of the year on Monday before erasing those loses by Thursday. Calm returned to the market as the People’s Bank of China was seen as attempting to stabilize the yuan amid U.S. accusations of currency manipulation, but credit traders remained jumpy about the possibility that the economic conflict could still ratchet up further.
The trade war escalation “could easily have spooked some investors and caused others to throw their hands up in the air and take some chips off the table,” said Scott Buchta, head of fixed income strategy at Brean Capital. “It’s very hard to trade in a market driven more by headlines than by the underlying technicals or fundamentals.”
While new high-grade debt sales have exceeded estimates this week, led by Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY).’s $13 billion bond deal to fund its acquisition of Anadarko, high-yield investors have largely stepped back. Junk-bond sales this week may stand at about $2.25 billion by Friday versus just under $10 billion for the week ended Aug. 10 last year.

Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. brought some junk bond investors back after Monday’s equities market rout, with a transaction that may price tomorrow, however sales were largely muted. Plastic autoparts maker U.S. Farathane LLC meanwhile pulled a deal that was marketing, as arrangers cited market conditions.
Broader speculative-grade market metrics also deteriorated. On Wednesday, junk-bond yields rose near a two-month high. CCC rated bonds weakened the most, as spreads widened to 905 basis points more than U.S. Treasuries, their widest since January."

 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) guided revenue in the range of $250 to $255 million for the third quarter, above expectations of $246 million. For the full year, revenue is expected in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.095 billion, also above expectations of $1.05 billion.
Roku soared 20%, taking its year-to-date gains to about 297%. 
The rosier outlook comes as earnings and revenue topped estimates. 
Roku reported a second-quarter loss of 8 cents a share on revenue of $250.1 million, beating consensus estimates from Investing.com for a loss of 23 cents a share on revenue of $224 million. 
The streaming-TV platform specialist’s revenue was driven by a 51% increase in platform revenue, which accounts for about 67% of total revenue, in the second quarter from a year earlier thanks to increasing users and higher spending per user.
Active accounts during the quarter grew 39% year-on-year to 30.5 million with users streaming 9.4 billion hours during the period, up 72% from the year ago quarter. Average revenue per user grew 27% to $21.06, surpassing $20 for the first time.
""Total revenue growth accelerated to 59% [year over year], primarily driven by growth in advertising as Roku-monetized video ad impressions once again more than doubled [year over year],"" Roku said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's top gas producer Gazprom (MM:GAZP) and a raft of other major firms have added to calls for the banking sector to use domestic ratings in implementing new financial regulations, saying this would ease pressure on banks and cut lending rates.
Officials have challenged the way the central bank is instructing lenders to comply with new Basel III regulations.
The finance ministry says the capital buffers banks require under the rules should be set according to ratings by domestic agencies, while the central bank wants to use its own in-house assessments.
""It is very hard to forecast how accessible the external market will be for Russian borrowers for political reasons, so the development of our own financial market, including rating agencies, is timely,"" Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Famil Sadygov told Reuters.
""We believe that using national ratings would make it possible to significantly lower pressure on (banking) capital, having a positive impact on the cost of borrowing, both for borrowers and banks.""
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov asked the central bank in July to postpone reforms requiring banks to increase capital buffers under the Basel III rules until domestic ratings can be used in that process, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Russia started to actively develop its domestic ratings system after western sanctions were imposed in 2014. That led global rating agencies to cut Russia's sovereign rating, triggering a revision of the creditworthiness of Russian firms.
But critics say that Russia's domestic ratings lack in-depth statistics on defaults and cover a limited number of companies.
In a separate letter to President Vladimir Putin obtained by Reuters, heads of Gazprom, Tatneft, Novatek and Severgroup asked Putin to support the use of domestic ratings as ""the best way to reflect the true credit risks of... borrowers"".
According to the letter, a rare example of unity among Russia's top companies, using domestic ratings would allow banks to lower lending rates, strengthen financial stability, and ease the refinancing of external debt.
""Altogether, (it) will lead to an increase in the domestic economy's competitiveness, (and a) strengthening of the country's economic security,"" it said.
Russia's central bank told Reuters it remained committed to its present stance. ""Our approach... allows the Russian banking system to free up much more capital to lend to the economy compared to the ratings-based approach.""
A high-ranked source close to the Kremlin confirmed the authenticity of the letter, redirected by Putin to the relevant ministers and officials on July 29, and said the issue is likely to be discussed at governmental level.
A second high-ranked financial official confirmed that the government plans to discuss the issue. ""If no common position is agreed, then a meeting at Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin) level is possible,"" he said.
Novatek, Tatneft and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not respond to Reuters' request for comment."

(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co's (O:KHC) net income halved in the first six months of the year, the packaged food maker said on Thursday as it wrote down the value of several business units by over $1 billion in results delayed by an internal investigation into procurement practices.
The company took a charge of about $744 million on its U.S. refrigerated, Latin American exports and Brazil units among others, blaming lower five-year operating forecasts. It also booked an impairment charge of about $474 million in the second quarter to write down the value of six brands, including Velveeta and Cool Whip.
The company added that the impairment charges for the first half of 2019 were preliminary and subject to finalization of control procedures.
This marks Kraft Heinz's second major writedown since Feb. 21, when the company knocked $15.4 billion off the value of its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands, posted a surprise quarterly loss, and disclosed a U.S. Security and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting practices.
After an internal review of the accounting missteps, Kraft Heinz said it had increased the initial brand writedown by about $13 million due to misstatements in reports for 2016, 2017 and the first nine months of 2018.
The company's shares fell 6.5% in premarket trading on Thursday. The stock has lost a third of its value since February.
""The level of decline we experienced in the first half of this year is nothing we should find acceptable moving forward,"" said Kraft Heinz's new Chief Executive Officer Miguel Patricio. Patricio a 30-year marketing veteran from  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), was named to the role in April.
Kraft Heinz's struggles have rocked other major consumer goods companies this year, highlighting the industry's struggle to cut costs without gutting marketing budgets. Companies from Kellogg (N:K) to Procter & Gamble (N:PG) have raised prices and invested to keep products relevant amid intense private-label competition from grocers including Walmart (N:WMT), Kroger (N:KR) and Amazon.com (O:AMZN). Net income attributable to the company's shareholders fell to $854 million, or 70 cents per share, in the six months ended June 29, from $1.76 billion, or $1.43 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the Chicago-based company earned $1.44 per share, compared with $1.89 a year earlier. Kraft Heinz said net sales fell about 5% to $12.37 billion."
534,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 01:50PM ET</span>","Signs of price truce push Lyft, Uber higher","By Tanvi Mehta
(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc's (O:LYFT) hints that its cut-throat rivalry with U.S. ride-hailing rival Uber Inc (N:UBER) is easing may prove bad news for customers but it sent shares in both companies sharply higher on Thursday.
With Uber set to report after Wall Street closes, analysts were excited by Lyft's 72% rise in second-quarter revenue and its assertion higher spend per rider - read higher prices - would pull both third quarter and full-year sales above market expectations.
Finance chief Brian Roberts said 2018 was likely the peak of losses for Lyft and said pricing had become ""more rational"", meaning the company should spend less on the constant promotions and incentives it and Uber have used to win market share.
At least nine brokerages raised their price targets on Lyft stock in response, with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) the most bullish with a price target of $96.
Shares of Lyft jumped 8% to $64.99 in trading before the bell, while those of Uber rose 4.2% at $41.35 as traders bet its results would produce a similar message.
""While Lyft continues to spend aggressively on various initiatives, competitive pressure on rider incentives for core ride-sharing continues to ease, which is a sign of a rational duopoly between Lyft and Uber for the moment,"" PiperJaffray analysts said.
""We believe Lyft will be both a catalyst and beneficiary of the growth of ride-sharing and autonomous tech over the next 10+ years.""
Lyft and larger rival Uber, both loss-making, have historically given deep discounts to attract riders, and Wall Street's concern over the associated costs has driven shares in both lower since their stock market launches earlier this year.
Canaccord analysts said Lyft's 22% expansion in revenue per rider in the quarter seemed to be driven much more by it reducing the incentives it gives to customers than any increase in numbers of riders.
With the companies having faced protests in several U.S. cities against efforts to lower driver costs, pushing ride prices higher has become vital for their efforts to gain investors' faith in their long-term prospects.
""Lyft is starting to prove (it has a) path to profitability, which was the main reason for investor pushback during the initial public offering,"" RBC analysts wrote in a client note. ""The read-through to Uber is likely to be positive."""

UniCredit announced the death of Saccomanni on Thursday, only a day after the former deputy governor of the Bank of Italy attended the bank's results presentation in Milan.
""I have lost a friend of great intelligence and humanity, highly competent with a fine sense of culture and wit,"" UniCredit Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier said.
Saccomanni was appointed chairman of UniCredit's board, a non-executive role, in April last year as part of measures taken to improve corporate governance. The bank has been run by Mustier, a Frenchman, since July 2016.
""Our daily interactions were both stimulating and intellectually challenging. UniCredit has also lost a chairman who expertly guided the board through a period of intensive challenges, always maintaining a clear strategic vision and a strong sense of direction,"" Mustier added in a statement.
Born in Rome in 1942, Saccomanni earned a degree in economics from Milan's Bocconi university before moving on to postgraduate studies at Princeton in the United States. He held a series of senior roles representing Italy at the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and other European institutions. 

Deputy Chairman Cesare Bisoni will take on Saccomanni's role at UniCredit pending the appointment of a new chairman, the bank said.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 12:52PM ET</span>",U.S. small-cap stocks under renewed threat from tariffs,"By April Joyner and Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Last week's announcement of more U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods may have undermined the prospects for small-cap stocks to rebound this year, even after a brief respite from the Federal Reserve's recent interest-rate cut. Just a day after the Fed cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, President Donald Trump vowed on Aug. 1 to impose 10% tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese goods beginning on Sept. 1.
The prospect of lower interest rates has helped combat concerns about slowing economic growth, which have hampered the performance of small-cap shares over the past year. But such relief has quickly faded as fears have mounted that additional tariffs could impede the U.S. economy. A U.S. economic slowdown would bode especially poorly for small-cap companies, which tend to be more domestically focused than their large-cap counterparts. ""What small caps need above all else is a confirmation that the U.S. economy is on solid footing,"" Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey, said in an interview on Tuesday.
Strategists have said the risks to the U.S. economy increase as the trade war escalates. Morgan Stanley's chief economist wrote in a note on Monday that if the trade war intensifies with the United States raising tariffs to 25% on all imports from China for four to six months, the global economy could enter a recession in three quarters.
Moreover, he wrote, ""about two-thirds of goods tariffed in this round are consumer goods, which could lead to a more pronounced impact on the U.S. as compared to earlier tranches.""
Since Trump's announcement last Thursday of additional tariffs, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index has fallen about 3.1%, further than the benchmark S&P 500's 2.1% slide.
SHRINKING PROFIT MARGINS
Given the renewed threat of tariffs, small-cap stocks are likely to continue to underperform for at least the next few months, said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services. SunTrust recently upgraded its rating on U.S. small-cap stocks, citing their low valuations. But Lerner said he expects investors to remain wary of small-cap stocks until the possibility of further escalation in the U.S.-China trade war recedes.
""Small caps looked like they were about to break out,"" he said. ""But as soon as (Trump's) tweet came out, they broke down."" In particular, recent developments on tariffs have brought small-cap companies' shrinking profit margins back into focus, an issue that has dragged down their shares over the past year.
Revenue growth for smaller companies has largely kept pace with that of large-cap companies, said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. But rising wage and input costs have resulted in lower profits for the group. According to IBES data from Refinitiv, as of Wednesday, earnings for companies in the small-cap S&P 600 Index were expected to have declined 6.3% year-over-year for the second quarter of 2019 while second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies were expected to have risen 2.7%.
Furthermore, profit margin projections have fallen for small-cap companies more sharply than for large-cap companies since the end of June, according to research from Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. Added costs from tariffs would further depress small-cap earnings.
""There's definitely a margin issue if costs rise and they can't pass them on to consumers,"" DeSanctis said.
Heightened trade tensions in recent days have raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will further cut interest rates. As of Thursday, traders were fully pricing in a 25 basis-point cut at the Fed's next meeting in September, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
But even lower rates would do little to bolster small-cap shares without at least a detente in U.S.-China trade relations, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. Conversely, a walk-back of the additional tariffs coupled with a reacceleration of U.S. economic data following the Fed's recent rate cut could help jump-start small-cap shares, in her view.
""That's the scenario where small caps could really perform better,"" she said."

543,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 12:46PM ET</span>",U.S. natural gas demand is at a record - and prices keep dropping,"By Scott DiSavino
(Reuters) - U.S. natural gas demand is at an all-time high and expected to keep rising - and yet, prices are falling.
U.S. gas futures this week collapsed to a three-year low, while spot prices were on track to post their weakest summer in over 20 years. In other markets, such lackluster pricing would cause investment to retrench and supply to contract.
But gas production is at a record high and expected to keep growing. Demand is rising as power generators shut coal plants and burn more gas for electricity and as rapidly expanding liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals turn more of the fuel into super-cooled liquid for export.
Analysts believe the natural gas market is not trading on demand fundamentals because supply growth continues to far outpace rising consumption. Energy firms are pulling record amounts of oil from shale formations and with that oil comes associated gas that needs either to be shipped or burned off.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gas futures (NGc1) this week dropped to $2.03 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), the lowest since May 2016. For the summer, spot gas prices at the Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana were on track to fall to their lowest since 1998.[NGA/]
Gas speculators last week boosted their net short positions to the highest on record, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
""All the bulls are gone,"" said Kyle Cooper, consultant at ION Energy in Houston.
The market is expecting a big boost in gas output this fall after  Kinder Morgan  Inc's (N:KMI) Gulf Coast Express pipeline comes online in September and releases some of the gas currently stranded and being burned in the Permian.
So much associated gas is coming out of the ground that gas prices in the Permian basin in Texas and New Mexico, the biggest U.S. shale oil formation, have turned negative on multiple occasions this year.
Meg Gentle, CEO of U.S. LNG company Tellurian Inc (O:TELL), said current pipeline expansion plans will not meet record gas production in the Permian, leading to severely depressed prices at the Waha Hub in West Texas, which touched a record low of negative $9/mmBtu in April.
""Negative $9. I'd be happy taking it all for $1,"" Gentle said earlier this year at a conference. Tellurian is developing the Driftwood LNG export plant in Louisiana and pipelines to transport gas from fields like the Permian to the Gulf Coast.
GRAPHIC: Waha prices turn negative: https://tmsnrt.rs/2GTjcvu
The rising production has offset a nominally bullish factor like persistently low inventories. While recent declines in oil and gas prices have prompted energy firms to cut spending on new drilling, a drop in production growth is still considered far away. [EIA/GAS] [RIG/U]
The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects gas production will rise 10% to 91 billion cubic feet per day in 2019 after soaring 12% to a record 83.4 bcfd in 2018, its biggest annual percentage increase since 1951.
One billion cubic feet is enough gas to fuel about five million U.S. homes for a day.
GRAPHIC: Falling gas prices: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YR4o6K
LNG ISN'T ENOUGH
U.S. LNG exports, particularly to Asia, are powering increased demand. They are expected to rise from a record 3.0 bcfd in 2018 to 6.9 bcfd in 2020, according to EIA projections, making LNG the nation's fastest-growing source of demand. Still, LNG exports account for only about 5% of total U.S. gas use.
""LNG is still not a significant enough portion of the consumption pie to independently push prices higher,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates of Galena, Illinois.
Meanwhile, U.S. power generators' gas use may be peaking, rising to an expected record 30.6 bcfd in 2019 but then falling to 29.6 bcfd in 2020 as renewables produce more electricity, EIA data shows.
Daniel Myers, market analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston, said ""persistent low prices are beginning to crimp producers' growth expectations"" in gas-heavy shale formations such as the Marcellus in Pennsylvania or the Haynesville in Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas.
But the sheer volume of gas produced in oil-heavy plays like the Permian means that supply could remain robust.
""Production in the Permian is nearly entirely oil-driven and independent from gas prices,"" said Myers."
544,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 12:37PM ET</span>",PG&E shareholders outline possible $15 billion rights issue,"(Reuters) - PG&E Corp (N:PCG) shareholders are proposing raising $15 billion in equity to fund a planned reorganization of the power producer facing huge liabilities from California wildfires, according to a company filing on Thursday. 
The proposed fundraising, a rights offering of selling new shares, is the latest effort to rescue PG&E, which sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after severe wildfires in 2017 and 2018 resulted in more than $30 billion in liabilities.
The California utility currently has the sole right to put forward a reorganization plan, although other investors have asked a judge to allow them to do so as well.
Hedge funds Knighthead Capital Management and Abrams Capital Management, the shareholders that made the proposal in a letter to PG&E, pledged to purchase a portion of the offered equity if shares are left unsold through a so-called backstop commitment, the filing showed. 
""PG&E is currently working its way through a complicated restructuring process. As a result of significant wildfire liabilities and related capital obligations, the company faces a material need for new funding,"" the two hedge funds said in the filing. Together they own about 7.3% of PG&E, according to Refinitiv data. 
In May, state fire investigators determined that PG&E transmission lines caused the deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record in California, a blaze that killed 85 people last year.
Nearly 19,000 homes and other structures were destroyed. The death toll stands as the greatest loss of life from a single wildfire in California history. 

The proposed term sheet for the backstop commitment plan ""contemplates that all subrogation claims and wildfire claims shall not exceed $16 billion in the aggregate,"" according to the filing.

548,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 12:26PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Iraq close to pipeline deal with BP and Eni, rather than Exxon - sources","By Aref Mohammed and Ahmed Rasheed
BASRA, Iraq/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq is close to reaching a deal with oil majors  BP  and Eni for an export pipeline project that was initially planned as part of a mega-deal with U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil, according to five senior Iraqi oil officials involved in the negotiations.
Under the proposed $400 million agreement, British company BP (L:BP) and Italy's Eni (NI:ENI) would run the scheme to build two seabed oil pipelines for Iraq's southern exports through the Gulf, the sources told Reuters, declining to be named as the discussions have not been made public.
The pipeline work was meant to be part of a larger, $53 billion project that Exxon (N:XOM) looked poised to move ahead with earlier this year, but an agreement with Baghdad was held back by contractual wrangling and security concerns, the officials said.
The 30-year mega-project is the focus of Exxon's plans to expand in Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer, and a chipping away of schemes from the deal could drag on the company's ambitions.
The BP and Eni talks with Baghdad follow an announcement from Iraqi officials in June that South Korea's Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd  (KS:000720) had been selected to build a $2.4 billion seawater injection facility - another part of the deal originally on the table with Exxon. 
ExxonMobil and Eni declined to comment, while BP had no immediate comment.
In May, Iraq's proposed bumper deal with Exxon appeared imminent. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed it with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi twice in three days, including during a surprise visit to Baghdad. Abdul Mahdi, meanwhile, said Iraq was close to signing the agreement with the American company and its venture partner PetroChina. 
But negotiations subsequently became protracted over contract conditions and escalating tensions between Iraq's bigger neighbor Iran and the United States, Baghdad's two main allies.
Talks to reach at least an initial agreement were held up by two separate evacuations of Exxon's foreign staff from Iraq, the first after Washington warned of Iranian threats to U.S. interests there, and the second prompted by a rocket attack that appeared to target the company.
The five senior Iraqi oil officials said the delays had forced Iraq to consider other companies to help construct infrastructure for its offshore export terminals.
    ""We can't wait for Exxon forever. We have serious problems with our sea pipelines and urgently need to find partners to help build new ones. Further delays could harm our sea export infrastructure,"" said one of the officials, who oversees export infrastructure in the south of the country.  
RUPTURES, LEAKS
The project that Iraq is discussing with BP and Eni involves the replacement of two old seabed pipelines, including an idled one which transports crude to the Khor al-Amaya terminal. 
Loading operations have been halted at Khor al-Amaya since 2017 when the pipeline suffered ruptures and leakages and had to be shut, oil officials said. The other pipeline is operating at partial capacity to ship crude oil to the Basra offshore terminal.
Under the proposed deal, BP would finance the project and Eni would handle the procurement, engineering and construction tendering aspects, the sources said. 
The negotiations are in their final stages after the parties worked out a mechanism to allow the British company to recover its financing payments.
""In principle we agreed BP could recover its payments by taking oil shipments instead of cash, just like the mechanism we're following to pay the company to develop Rumaila oilfields,"" said one of the Iraqi officials.
Eni will be paid in cash for its work, the officials said.
The seawater injection project, which Hyundai has been selected for, was also originally part of Exxon's planned deal to develop Iraq's southern energy installations.
Iraq has no major water injection plant and needs one for its wells or would risk losing pressure and face severe production decline, especially at its mature oilfields. As freshwater is a scarce resource in Iraq, using treated seawater is one of the best alternatives.
Three of the oil officials said Exxon had costed the project at higher than Hyundai's $2.4 billion. They said other parts of the proposed Exxon project could go to other companies if they offered lower costs, including a project to build additional crude storage. 

The Hyundai deal, announced by the state-run Basra Oil Co, still requires the final approval of the oil ministry. One of the officials said the agreement would be finalised before the end of year.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 12:07PM ET</span>",Hedge fund Hoplite Capital plans to shut down: letter,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Hoplite Capital is returning money to outside clients after a period of sluggish returns, the firm's founder, John Lykouretzos, told investors in a letter on Wednesday.
""I have decided to close the Hoplite managed funds and return third-party capital as soon as possible,"" Lykouretzos said in the letter seen by Reuters.
Hoplite has not ""generated the returns necessary to maintain the capital duration required to successfully implement our stock picking strategy without distraction,"" he added in the letter.
The New York-based firm's decision to shut down marks the latest in a string of hedge fund closures and illustrates how difficult it has become to run a profitable firm at a time investors have moved to cheaper passive stock funds.
At the end of December, the 16-year-old Hoplite had roughly $1 billion in assets, according to a regulatory filing.
Lykouretzos ranked among the industry's brightest future stars when he left hedge fund Viking Global Investors to open his own business at the age of 29 in 2003.
Over its lifetime, Hoplite managed to stand out during times of market stress, including the 2008 financial crisis and again in 2011, 2015 and even last year, the manager wrote.
In 2018, when a late year stock market sell-off wiped away gains at many big hedge funds, Hoplite's return was flat, outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500, which fell roughly 5%.
In the first seven months of 2019, ended in July, the fund returned 7.3% net of fees.
However, ""the alpha we generated has been overshadowed by underperformance in other periods,"" Lykouretzos said.
Like other hedge funds, Hoplite had been hobbled by low market volatility. Lykouretzos made some changes roughly a year ago to put the firm on better footing, but the ""reset to a flatter, nimbler team"" was not enough.
He will now focus on returning investors' money and helping his team find new opportunities, he said. The bulk of the money will be returned to investors on or before Sept. 6.
Hoplite's decision to close comes only months after Tourbillon Capital Partners announced plans to shutter and Highfields Capital Management and Omega Advisors told clients they would stop managing outsiders' money to become family offices, investing mainly their founders' money.

At the end of the first quarter, US Food Holding Corp (N:USFD) healthcare information company IQVIA Holdings (N:IQV) and retailer Dollar Tree (O:DLTR) ranked among Hoplite's biggest holdings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A petition started by a junior Walmart Inc (N:WMT) worker in California to protest the retailer's sale of firearms, following two mass shootings over the weekend left 31 people dead in Texas and Ohio, has gathered more than 45,000 signatures.
Thomas Marshall, a 23-year-old category manager in San Bruno began his protest by emailing fellow employees and asking them to call in sick on Tuesday, leave work early on Wednesday, and to sign a Change.org petition.
The petition https://www.change.org/p/doug-mcmillon-stop-the-sale-of-guns-at-walmart-stores?utm_content=bandit-starter_cl_share_content_en-us%3Av4&recruited_by_id=fc7b5740-b810-11e9-be8a-6fbcafd3c27d&recruiter=989859201&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=share_petition, which is open to the public, is steadily approaching its goal of 50,000 signatures.
""In light of these recent tragedies -- a mere snapshot of the gun violence epidemic plaguing the United States -- and in response to Corporate's inaction, we as employees are organizing several days of action, to protest Walmart's profit from the sale of firearms and ammunition,"" the petition says.
Marshall told Reuters he and other organizers would send the petition to the company's Chief Executive Doug McMillon after it reaches its target. 
Marshall said he was shut out of the company's email and messaging networks temporarily earlier this week after he started the protest, but that he has since been granted access.
Employees in San Bruno and in Portland, Oregon had walked out on Wednesday in protest of the company's policy of selling firearms, Marshall said, adding that some Walmart employees in New York also held a minute of silence that day.
Walmart said 40 employees in San Bruno protested by walking out but did not confirm the other details.
""A lot more employees have been reaching out to me to express their support but a majority of those employees are very afraid of retaliation from the company,"" he said.
NO CHANGE IN GUN SALE POLICY
Earlier this week, Walmart told Reuters there had been no change in its policy on gun sales after the recent mass shootings, one of which took place in a Walmart store.
Years of public pressure led Walmart, the largest U.S arms retailer, to end assault-rifle sales in 2015 and to raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21 in 2018. 
Some gun control activists and Walmart customers now want the retailer to drop sales of guns and ammunition altogether.
Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Thursday the company continued to feel there were more appropriate ways for employees to engage with the retailer, including through discussions with top leadership. 
He said the company's policy on selling firearms had not changed.
""We have worked very hard to be a responsible firearms retailer...Walmart does more in the area of background checks than what the federal law requires,"" Hargrove added. 
The retailer's Chief Executive Doug McMillon sent a message to employees on social media late on Tuesday, assuring them the company was listening to their concerns. 

""We will be thoughtful and deliberate in our responses, and we will act in a way that reflects the best values and ideals of our company,"" McMillon said.

It also said it will sell $42 billion in three-month bills, the most since April, on Monday and $42 billion in six-month bills, the most since October 2018.
The government's cash had been dwindling before U.S. President Donald Trump and federal lawmakers reached a two-year spending deal that allows for more borrowing to meet its obligations.
On Tuesday, the government ended the day with $129.18 billion in cash, compared with $423 billion at the end of April.
The Treasury would issue anywhere from $100 billion to $200 billion in additional T-bill supply, beginning in August in an effort to increase federal cash holdings to $350 billion by the end of September, analysts said.
The Treasury was scheduled to sell a record $40 billion in two-month bills and $50 billion in one-month bills on Thursday."

(Reuters) - Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), the owner of MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable networks, beat estimates for quarterly revenue and profit on Thursday, as it posted rare growth in domestic advertising revenue after five years of declines.
Shares rose 3% in morning trade.
Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish credited the U.S. ad rebound to ""the strategy we have been executing for the last two years,"" including new tools Viacom offered as part of its Advanced Marketing Solutions division that helped advertisers better target viewers, as well as growth in branded content.
Talks with CBS Corp (N:CBS) to recombine are continuing with a deal expected shortly, people familiar with the matter have said.
Last week, the two companies, both controlled by Sumner and Shari Redstone's National Amusements Inc, agreed to a management structure that will see Bakish become the CEO of the new company.
Viacom on Thursday did not provide any details on the merger talks.
A deal still rests on valuation, people familiar with the matter said. Viacom's financial results will likely be in its favor as it demonstrates how the company is in a much different position than it was when an attempt to recombine failed last year.
Viacom has staged a turnaround at its Paramount Hollywood studios, with a slate of 16 films including a sequel to the hit ""Top Gun"" and another ""Terminator film next year. 
It has purchased and rapidly expanded a free streaming site Pluto TV, whose viewership has risen to 18 million monthly visitors from 12 million when it was purchased in January.
It has accomplished what few thought was possible in a world where viewership at its cable channels has sunk - an advertising rebound.
Viacom said domestic advertising revenue rose 6% to $976 million, boosted by advanced advertising tools and branded content sales.
Revenue from the filmed entertainment division, which includes Paramount Pictures, rose 14% to $877 million, above estimates of $855.7 million.
Net income attributable to Viacom rose to $544 million, or $1.35 per share, in the third quarter ended June 30, from $522 million, or $1.29 per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue rose to $3.36 billion from $3.24 billion, beating the average estimate of $3.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.20 per share, above the average estimate of $1.07 per share.

Viacom reaffirmed its forecast of full year revenue growth in the low-to-mid-single-digits percentage on a constant currency basis.

Brazilian newspaper Estado de S. Paulo earlier reported that Antonio Palocci, a jailed former finance minister, had said in plea bargain testimony that the company made the payments to former presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff.

In a statement to Reuters, Ambev vigorously denied what it described as ""false and incoherent"" allegations. 
""False because we never made any inappropriate payments of any nature to receive undue benefits. And incoherent because, since 2015, the beverage sector has suffered through a major increase in (federal corporate) taxes, by around 60%, contradicting everything that was alleged.""

The move comes against the backdrop of the FDA's efforts to curb the usage of the addictive substances among young adults.
The agency said it has issued warning letters to Mighty Vapors LLC, Liquid Labs USA LLC, V8P Juice International LLC and Hookah Imports Inc and has sought their response within 15 days.(https://reut.rs/2YUeBn7)
The FDA said the products had been introduced into the market after the effective date of a rule that extended FDA's authority to all tobacco products, thereby making them adulterated or misbranded.
E-cigarettes have existed in a regulatory gray area for years and a U.S. federal judge in July ordered the FDA to implement a 10-month deadline for submitting a formal application by e-cigarette makers to keep their products on the market.
E-cigarettes are generally thought to be safer than traditional cigarettes, but the long-term health effects of the nicotine devices remain largely unknown.

LONDON (Reuters) - To make a quick mark on Europe's biggest bank, HSBC's caretaker boss Noel Quinn needs to succeed where other executives have failed: in its sprawling investment bank where a struggle to gain market share against Wall Street rivals continues. 
But the commercial banking chief - hand-picked to steady the Asia-focused lender after the sudden ousting of John Flint on Monday - will find a business hampered by internal factions and sliding morale.
A swift turnaround at HSBC's investment bank - the Global Banking & Markets (GBM) business run by Samir Assaf - would reassure investors and could spare Chairman Mark Tucker the task of finding someone else to fill one of banking's toughest roles, investor and HSBC insider sources said.
""HSBC's culture is not that easy to shift and it seems clear Mark [Tucker] is intent on that. Lean and focused is certainly good as indeed are quick wins,"" said Hugh Young, managing director at shareholder Aberdeen Asset Management Asia (L:SLA), identifying GBM as one of bank's simpler targets for change.
Three other investors contacted by Reuters, who declined to be named, also said the investment bank should be Quinn's near-term priority.
HSBC declined to comment.
GBM generated 22.6% of group profits in the first half but also accounted for 29.6% of expenses. Quinn's commercial banking division, by contrast, made up 32.1% of profits while retail banking and wealth management accounted for 35.5%, highlighting GBM as one of the bank's biggest underperformers.
Returns in HSBC's U.S. operations and a slow-going push into China's Pearl River Delta (PRD) have also drawn criticism but investors contacted by Reuters said they accepted that these were core to the bank's long-term fortunes and flaws could not be addressed overnight.
Tackling the investment bank, however, is a more achievable task for an interim chief, who is described by Tucker as ambitious and decisive, and could feed through to the bottom line at a faster pace.
""It's darned difficult for quick wins either in the U.S. or in PRD,"" Aberdeen's Young said.
SPRAWLING
HSBC's GBM business, largely based out of London, spans investment banking and corporate finance, including M&A, stock market listings, bond, equity and loan issuance and also trading, trade finance and cash management.
HSBC on Monday said it would cut around 2% of its workforce or around 4,000 jobs this year to rein in costs.
One source familiar with the bank's thinking said the bulk of cuts would fall in GBM, where revenue growth is expected to cool on the back of fewer deals and tighter loan growth in China and Hong Kong.
The division is battling to recover ground lost to the likes of JPMorgan (N:JPM), Citi (N:C) and Bank of America (N:BAC), but progress has been mixed, league tables by Refinitiv show.
HSBC has upped its market share for M&A and equities deals by 2.8% and 0.7% respectively so far this year, rising 21 and 4 places respectively to number 17 and number 13 in the rankings.
But market share has slipped by 0.5% in bonds and 0.2% in loans over the same period, in the only two areas where it commands top-10 positions, the data shows, highlighting the scale of Quinn's challenge.
Among the world's top dozen investment banks, HSBC in 2018 ranked in the top three for revenues earned in only two product groups out of 14 tracked by industry analytics firm Coalition, namely G10 foreign exchange and emerging markets macro products.
U.S. rivals JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Citi ranked in the top tier for 14, 8 and 8 such products respectively.
'THEM AND US'
Before mounting a serious challenge to rivals, Quinn needs to neutralize some influential factions within GBM, and link it more closely with other parts of the bank, something his predecessors struggled to achieve, HSBC sources said.
Frequent job culls and leadership changes since the 2008 financial crisis have opened up divisions between different parts of the business and also between bosses and staff.
""None of us really know who Quinn is. People were looking him up [on Monday],"" one GBM trader told Reuters.
""We are so far removed from each other. At my previous bank, I knew everyone up the chain, at least by name and title. Here I haven't the foggiest. They sit in their ivory towers,"" the trader said.
HSBC has broken with tradition in recent years and headhunted external candidates to manage the investment banking division of GBM, to reinvigorate what some analysts describe as a bureaucratic and insular culture.
Former Goldman Sachs (N:GS) banker Matthew Westerman was the first such hire but he left in November 2017 after two years marked by sweeping job cuts and a crackdown on colleagues who did not spend enough time meeting clients.
Robin Phillips, one half of the duo who replaced Westerman, handed over sole control of that business to former JP Morgan executive Greg Guyett in February, just months after colleagues circulated a memo accusing Phillips of overseeing ""persistent failure"" in the unit.
Guyett put his own stamp on the banking division with the latest reshuffle of senior roles in April.
One former U.S. based employee, who left the bank a few months ago, described low morale and staff retention as serious problems because HSBC was seen by some as ""the loser bank to work for"", due to performance and past reputation issues.
""Employees expressed that they wanted better technology and better benefits but investments in the business or the workforce never followed,"" the ex-employee said."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), is in talks with the owners of gourmet date producer Bateel over a potential investment in the firm, sources told Reuters.
If a deal goes through, it could pave the way for Saudi Arabia, which is heavily reliant on oil exports, to expand overseas sales of the fruit. It is among the top three global producers of dates.
Bateel, whose Arabic name is derived from the young offshoot of a date palm, owns date groves in Al Ghat, about 250 km away from the capital Riyadh, and has a chain of cafes and bakeries for gourmet food and beverages.
The company is owned by Saudi businessman Ziad Al Sudairy and L Catterton Asia, an Asian private equity firm backed by France's LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH). 
Bateel's owners are in exclusive, bilateral discussions with the PIF, said five banking sources with knowledge of the deal, who declined to be named due to commercial sensitivities. 
There is no process for the sale, and the size of the investment is yet to be determined based on a valuation of the company and any plans the PIF might have for it, the sources said.
Neither the PIF, which manages about $300 billion in assets, nor Bateel responded to Reuters' requests for comment. L Catterton Asia declined to comment.
The PIF has a strategy to help support Saudi companies become national and global champions in their sectors. 
Its investments in the Saudi food and agriculture sector include dairy group Almarai (SE:2280), the Saudi Agriculture and Livestock Investment Company (SALIC), and the kingdom's largest food products company Savola Group (SE:2050). 
PIF also owns a stake in Kuwaiti food company Americana Group.
""This investment probably makes more sense from a cultural and economic point of view for the PIF than some of their other investments"", said a Saudi banker familiar with the matter, alluding to its experience investing in the food sector. 
The owners are being advised by Goldman Sachs (N:GS), the sources said. 
Saudi Arabia is home to more than 28.5 million palm trees, according to the National Center for Palms and Dates. 
The kingdom's date exports reached 140,000 tonnes in 2017, worth 700 million riyals ($187 million), according to the Saudi state news agency SPA. That accounted for around 2% of the 4 billion riyal global market.

Palm trees are visible in the Saudi emblem and coat of arms, while its fruit is used by Muslims to break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan.

563,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 08:43AM ET</span>",Even Europe’s Worst-Performing IPO is a Buy for Bullish Analysts,"(Bloomberg) -- Analysts are notoriously wary of issuing sell ratings on stocks and nowhere is this more apparent than in Europe’s market for initial public offerings.
For the 18 companies that listed in Europe this year with an offer size of at least $100 million and that are covered by analysts, every rating bar one is either buy or hold, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The only sell is by DNB ASA‘s Ole Martin Westgaard on Norwegian internet company Adevinta AS.
The latest example of IPO bullishness is Global Fashion Group SA, the region’s worst-performing new offering this year. At least three analysts -- from banks that underwrote the sale -- began coverage Thursday on the Luxembourg e-commerce company with buy recommendations. The stock is down 21% since it began trading last month.
It’s not uncommon for banks that manage an IPO to publish favorable research, and Global Fashion is no outlier. But analyst bullishness on recent listings is interesting because investors are proving increasingly skittish about putting money in new stocks at what many of them say are top-of-the-market valuations.
Traton SE, the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG trucks unit that went public last month, was also greeted with no sell ratings when banks began coverage on Wednesday. The stock is down almost 10% since its IPO. Rovio Entertainment Oyj, the Finnish maker of the Angry Birds game, met with analyst bullishness after its 2017 IPO, even as the stock slid.
There’s little correlation between how a newly listed stock performs and how it is subsequently rated by analysts. Adevinta is the top-performing IPO in Europe this year after Network International. John Mattson Fastighetsforetag AB, the next best performer, has two hold ratings with no buys.
Global Fashion’s IPO was priced below the company’s anticipated price range, with weak demand leading the company’s owners -- Swedish investment firm Kinnevik AB and German startup factory Rocket Internet SE -- to take up about 50% of the shares on offer.
Other listings that priced at the bottom end of their initial price ranges, including Traton and Airtel Africa Plc, now have at least five analysts each recommending that investors buy the stock."

COPENHAGEN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian-led gas pipeline project across the Baltic Sea to Europe could be delayed by up to eight months and cost an extra 660 million euros ($740 million) due to hurdles in securing the necessary permits from Denmark, the pipeline operator has said.
The 1,230-km (765-mile) Nord Stream 2 pipeline, now under construction, has come under fire from the United States and several eastern European, Nordic and Baltic countries, which say the conduit will increase Europe's reliance on Russian gas.
The timeline of the project, led by state-owned Gazprom (MM:GAZP), is key for the future of the gas transit contract between Moscow and Kiev, as Ukraine is Russia's main gas route for exports to Europe.
The transit contract, a large source of budget revenue for Ukraine, expires at the end of this year. Nord Stream 2, according to its initial schedule, should have been ready by then.
Gazprom has completed more than 70% of Nord Stream 2 but since April 2017 has had pending applications with Danish authorities to lay between 147 and 175 km via Danish waters.
Nord Stream 2, aimed at doubling the annual capacity of the existing Nord Stream pipeline by adding 55 billion cubic meters, is to run via the waters of Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. It has approvals from all countries whose waters it crosses apart from Denmark.
The Russian-led company submitted two route applications with the Danish authorities, of which the first was proposed more than two years ago. In March, the Danish Energy Agency requested an environmental assessment of a third route option.
Nord Stream 2 labeled the third route request ""a deliberate attempt to delay the project's completion"".
Nord Stream 2, in a complaint to the Danish authorities in April, said costs related to the new request for a third route had already totaled more than 100 million euros.
According to the letter, obtained by Reuters, the request for a third route could result in a delay of up to eight months and further costs of 560 million euros. The initial budget was 9.5 billion euros.
""Delaying the project will result in a significant financial loss for Nord Stream 2,"" the letter said, asking the Danish Energy Board of Appeal to nix the energy agency's request.
Nord Stream 2 said in the letter that it had ""repeatedly asked for a status update ... without receiving any response"".
Aside from Gazprom, half of the funding for Nord Stream 2 is being provided by Germany's Uniper (DE:UN01) and BASF's (DE:BASFn) Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch company Shell (L:RDSa), Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV) and France's Engie (PA:ENGIE).
Reuters obtained the document from the Danish Energy Board of Appeal under laws on freedom of information.
The Danish Energy Agency confirmed that Nord Stream 2 had appealed its decision. The agency said it has made its reasons for requesting a third route application clear to the appeal board but declined to elaborate.
NO MORE VETO
Nord Stream 2 told Reuters it had informed the Danish Energy Agency about the potential impact of delays on costs and the project schedule, but declined to confirm the figures contained in the letter.
""A delay of several months will lead to additional costs of several hundred million euros but we cannot fully quantify because the final impacts depend on the timing of the permit decision of the responsible authorities,"" it said.
In June, Nord Stream 2 withdrew its initial 2017 application for a route through Danish territorial waters south of the Baltic island of Bornholm.
Denmark could have vetoed the initial route. The country passed a law in 2017 that would allow it to ban the pipeline from passing through its territorial waters on security grounds.
However, no veto can be applied for the two remaining route options as they would steer the pipeline through Denmark's exclusive economic zone, not its territorial waters.
According to Reuters calculations based on Nord Stream 2 data and the speed of construction, Gazprom's pipe-layers will reach the Danish exclusive economic zone between three and five months from now.
Nord Stream 2 said in May the project may be launched in 2020 rather than the end of 2019 due to delays in obtaining permits from Denmark.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said last month that Moscow had offered Kiev a short-term gas transit deal to substitute the current 10-year contract after it ends this year."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. cloud-based service provider Salesforce (N:CRM) agreed to buy U.S.-Israeli software developer ClickSoftware for $1.35 billion in cash and shares, in a bid to accelerate growth of its cloud-based products to manage customer service operations.
The deal comes a week after Salesforce completed its more than $15 billion purchase of data analytics firm Tableau.
The deal came about after the two companies worked together for three years, said Elad Donsky, vice president of engineering at Salesforce Israel. 
ClickSoftware makes cloud-based field service management software - which tracks and manages technicians and employees who work outside office locations - for customers like Bosch, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs).
""This is just the start of innovation on this,"" Donsky told Reuters, referring to the field service management software sector. 
This is the second major deal by Salesforce in Israel since July 2018 when it paid $850 million for Datorama, a cloud-based artificial intelligence marketing platform that makes up one of Salesforces's two research and development facilities in Israel.
The ClickSoftware deal would bring the number of employees at Salesforce in Israel to above 600, Donsky said.
""Salesforce will continue to invest in Israel,"" he said. ""Israel is now a strategic R&D hub for the company so we are going to see more growth in the coming years.""
U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners bought ClickSoftware in 2015 for $438 million.
Salesforce said its offer was net of the value of shares it already owns, after taking into consideration estimated purchase price adjustments. 

The acquisition is expected to close during Salesforce's fiscal quarter ending Oct. 31 pending various approvals.

(Reuters) - CBS Corp (N:CBS) and AT&T Inc (N:T) signed a new multi-year content carriage agreement, ending a 20 day-long blackout that began when the previous, seven-year deal expired at 2:00 a.m. EST on July 19. 
As a result of the contract dispute and after months of negotiations over retransmission fees, CBS stations went dark for more than 6.5 million DirecTV, DirecTV Now and AT&T U-verse customers in at least 14 U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
The agreement includes retransmission consent for all 26 CBS-owned stations in 17 markets including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, the companies said.
The companies did not disclose the terms of the agreement.
The two sides negotiated over pricing, as well as whether AT&T could sell CBS' All-Access streaming service as a separate option and whether CBS would be required to produce programming such as the Grammy Awards in a higher-than-typical 4K resolution, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.
They also negotiated on whether CBS would provide AT&T with past episodes and entire seasons of shows, and whether CBS content would be available to all DirecTV consumers, according to the sources.
CBS is one of several networks - including sibling company Viacom (O:VIAB), A&E Networks (owned jointly by Hearst Networks and the Walt  Disney  Co. (N:DIS)) and Nexstar (O:NXST) - to publicly feud with AT&T over contract negotiations this year. 

The contract dispute comes at a time of uncertainty for CBS and transition for AT&T. CBS is considering a merger with Viacom. AT&T bought Time Warner - which it renamed WarnerMedia - for $85 billion last year, and is preparing to launch its HBO Max streaming service in spring 2020.

The comments by Swire, whose business spans retail to property to airlines, come after similar concerns raised by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels (HK:0045)'s on Wednesday. Swire owns 45% of Cathay Pacific, Refinitiv data shows.
""The protests in Hong Kong have had some effect on retail sales at our malls, particularly at Pacific Place. If the protests continue, sales are likely to continue to be affected,"" Michelle Low, Swire Pacific finance director said in the interim results statement on Thursday, referring to its high-end shopping mall in Admiralty, a financial district where many of the mass protests took place. 
""Trading conditions for our hotels are expected to be stable in the second half of 2019, except that occupancy in Hong Kong has been affected somewhat by the protests and this is likely to continue if the situation persists.""
Swire said the global trade tensions were also causing uncertainty.
Millions have taken to Hong Kong streets in anti-government protests that have intensified since mid-June, at times forcing banks, stores, shopping malls, restaurants and even government buildings to close as the demonstrations degenerated into violent clashes between police and activists.
Hong Kong's Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau said on Thursday the drop in inbound tourists accelerated in the past few weeks, with the first week of August declining 31% from a year ago, compared to just single digit percentage drop in mid-July. 
He said the logistics and retail sectors together employ over 1 million people in Hong Kong, and it could hurt the city's employment if the sectors continue to be under pressure.
Travel Industry Council chairman Jason Wong told Reuters the number of tours from mainland China has fallen 40% to about 140 tours per day in the first week of August, from about 230 tours a day in the same period last year.
Wong also expressed concern that the number of business visitors would reduce as some business meetings and conferences were seen scaling back the size or being canceled.
""Many related workers may need to take no pay leave and their income will be affected,"" Wong said.

The investigation will try to ascertain if the government broke its own rules in taking out the loan (now worth $847 million). Marape was finance minister at the time.
""This enquiry ... is not just looking at leaders but also digging deeper into a separate and full scope of the entire UBS transaction,"" Marape told a televised news conference.
""The scope is not only confined to investigations in country. UBS transactions ha(ve) taken place in one or two other jurisdictions outside of our country and so the train of events will be followed by this inquiry... once concluded will put finality to the matters,"" he said, on a broadcast from local news station NBC News aired on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
UBS did not immediately return an emailed request for comment but has previously said it would not comment on specific transactions.
""UBS adheres to strict standards in the due diligence and execution processes of our banking operations,"" UBS said earlier this year.
Marape took over the role of prime minister in May from Peter O'Neill, who quit after a loss of confidence in his leadership.
The government later sold the stake in Oil Search (AX:OSH) and paid back the loan.
The PNG investigation comes after the loan was also scrutinized by the PNG's Ombudsman Commission. Former Treasurer Don Polye had said the deal breached budget guidelines.
Swiss financial watchdog FINMA said in March it was in contact with UBS about the loan.
Marape said the PNG government had asked for the investigation to be concluded within three months, although the timeframe could be extended.
The prime minister said he was also under investigation because he was finance minister at the time of the deal, but there was no preconceived gameplan for the investigation.
""The country deserves the fullest scrutiny as to what has happened,"" he said."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer (DE:BAYGn) is paying up to $600 million for full control of cell therapy developer BlueRock Therapeutics, stepping up investment in a promising new medical area to revive its drug development pipeline.
Having established BlueRock as part of a 2016 joint venture with Versant Ventures, Bayer will acquire the remaining 59.2% stake for about $240 million upfront and an additional $360 million depending on certain development achievements, it said on Thursday.
BlueRock, valued at about $1 billion by the deal, is working on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), made by reprogramming mature body cells to behave like embryonic stem cells that are injected to restore diseased tissue in patients.
While the biotech firm is looking to treat neurology, cardiology and immunology conditions, its most advanced program will begin testing on Parkinson's disease patients by the end of this year in a U.S. regulated trial.
""We get access and full ownership in one of the most exciting areas of biology that exist currently,"" Bayer's head of pharmaceuticals, Stefan Oelrich, said in an interview.
Parkinson's, a debilitating neurological disease that cannot be reversed, affects more than 7 million people globally.
Bayer has already tested the waters in iPSC research. In April it struck a deal with unlisted Khloris Biosciences to jointly develop anti-cancer vaccines based on iPSCs.
In July, it followed up with a $215 million investment in a minority stake in Century Therapeutics, another U.S. biotech group with a focus on iPSCs.
But Oelrich said the outright takeover of BlueRock marks Bayer's ""foundational piece"" because previous iPSC engagement had been via minority stakes and in much earlier phases of drug development.
Scientists at Kyoto University in Japan have been pioneering the technology, saying in July they would be the first to run a trial with iPSC in Parkinson's patients, having previously run tests on monkeys.
Bayer said last year it would lean more strongly on external firms and institutions to jumpstart is development pipeline, which analysts regard as too thin to make up for an expected decline in revenues from its two pharma bestsellers from about 2024.
But iPSC will likely be a crowded field with large companies such as Roche (S:ROG) and Fujifilm Holdings - which in 2015 bought Cellular Dynamics International Inc - in the race, as well as biotech firms including Fate Therapeutics (O:FATE) and Evotec (DE:EVTG).

LONDON (Reuters) - The rapidly growing exchange-traded-funds sector does not pose a threat to financial stability as the market has coped well so far with liquidity crunches, research from Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Thursday.
The findings will come as a relief after the suspension of a Woodford open-ended fund in June threw the regulatory spotlight on liquidity in funds generally.
FCA said that when the ETF market, up from $400 million globally in 2005 to over $5 trillion this year, came under pressure, more market participants stepped in to help investors sell their positions.
An ETF is a basket of securities that is listed on an exchange like a stock, offering exposure to a sector or index without the investor having to buy the underlying assets.
Buying and selling of ETFs is largely undertaken through ""authorised participants"" or APs, mainly investment or wholesale banks (IWBs) and proprietary trading firms (PTFs).
(GRAPHIC - FCA chart on ETFs: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Yuf6oC)
The five largest APs account for 75% of primary market trading volumes, with concentration rising in fixed income ETFs, where the five largest APs account for 91% of trading.
Three instances of stressed markets, December 2018, February 2018, and the U.S. presidential election in November 2016 saw APs who are normally less active enter the market to provide liquidity, the FCA said.
""Beyond these reassuring results, the analysis does not detect any initial signs of concern to financial stability,"" the FCA research said. Future work will examine the secondary market for ETFs.
FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey told the Observer newspaper this week that in light of the Woodford suspension, he was interested in U.S. style rules that tell investors how long it takes to sell shares in a fund to meet redemptions.
Since last December the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has required open-ended funds to classify holdings into four buckets according to how long it takes to sell them.
Shares could only be deemed highly liquid if they can be sold within three business days or less, while shares are ""illiquid"" if they cannot be sold in less than a week without significantly changing market value.
The FCA is considering new rules on illiquid assets in open ended funds, saying it will draw lessons from Woodford, with the watchdog's research signaling that for now, ETFs are in the clear."

LONDON/GENEVA (Reuters) - Global meat consumption must fall to curb global warming, reduce growing strains on land and water and improve food security, health and biodiversity, a United Nations report on the effects of climate change concluded.
Although the report stopped short of explicitly advocating going meat free, it called for big changes to farming and eating habits to limit the impact of population growth and changing consumption patterns on stretched land and water resources.
Plant-based foods and sustainable animal-sourced food could free up several million square kilometers of land by 2050 and cut 0.7-8.0 gigatonnes a year of carbon dioxide equivalent, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said.
""There are certain kinds of diets that have a lower carbon footprint and put less pressure on land,"" Jim Skea, professor at London's Imperial College, said on Thursday.
The IPCC met this week in Geneva, Switzerland to finalize its report which should help to guide governments meeting this year in Chile on ways to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement.
""The IPCC does not recommend people's diets ... Dietary choices are very often shaped or influenced by local production practices and cultural habits,"" Skea, who is one of the report's authors, told reporters in Geneva.
Land can be both a source and sink of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming, and better land management can help to tackle climate change, the IPCC said.
But it is not the only solution and cutting emissions from all sectors is essential to quickly curtail global warming.
""The window for making these changes is closing fast. If there is further delay in reducing emissions, we will miss the opportunity to successfully manage the climate change transition in the land sector,"" it said.
Since the pre-industrial era, land surface air temperature has risen by 1.53 degrees Celsius, twice as much as the global average temperature (0.87C), causing more heatwaves, droughts and heavy rain, as well as land degradation and desertification.
Human use directly affects more than 70% of the global, ice-free land surface and agriculture accounts for 70% of freshwater use, the IPCC added in the report.
Agriculture, forestry and other land use activities accounted for 23% of total net man-made greenhouse gas emissions during 2007-2016. When pre- and post-production activity in the food system are included, that rises to up to 37%.
Last year the IPCC's first special report warned that keeping the Earth's temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), rather than the 2C target agreed under the Paris accord, required rapid change across society.
FOOD SECURITY
The IPCC warned of more disruption to global food chains as extreme weather becomes more frequent due to climate change and said environmental costs should be factored into food.
It projects a median increase of 7.6% in cereal prices by 2050, meaning higher food prices and an increased risk of hunger.
While an estimated 821 million people are undernourished, changing consumption habits have already contributed to about 2 billion adults being overweight or obese.
Per capita supply of vegetable oils and meat has more than doubled based on data since 1961 but 25-30% of total food produced is still lost or wasted.
Yields of crops such as maize and wheat have declined in some regions, while those of maize, wheat and sugar beets have increased in others in recent decades.
FOREST FACTOR
While forests can soak up heat-trapping gases from the atmosphere, desertification and deforestation can amplify warming due to the loss of vegetation cover and soil erosion.
Measures to cut emissions, such as the production of biofuels, biochar - made from biomass - as well as planting trees, will also increase demand for land conversion.
Reducing deforestation and forest degradation could result in a reduction of 0.4-5.8 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent, the report said.
The Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), about 60% of which lies in Brazil, is sometimes called the ""lungs of the world"" due to the amount of CO2 it can absorb but it was not directly mentioned in the IPCC's summary for policymakers.
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has supported opening up protected areas of the world's largest tropical rainforest to facilitate agriculture and mining since taking office in January.
The report text is prepared by over 100 scientists but has to be approved by governments. In those discussions, Brazil and India were very active to protect their national agro-industrial interests, a source familiar with the talks said."

LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) surged 6% in premarket trading, after it reported a 72% jump in revenue and a narrower loss than expected after the close on Wednesday. It said earnings were fueled by more active riders. The company also said it expects its ride-hailing service to be profitable in the future but did not give a timeline. 
Rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) jumped 4.7% and is expected to report its earnings after the close, with analysts forecasting a loss of $2.10 on revenue of $3.31 billion. 
Both stocks are still trading over 10% below where their IPOs priced earlier this year. 
Nasdaq 100 futures rose 35 points or 0.5% by 6:40 AM ET (10:40 GMT), while Dow futures rallied 44 points or 0.2% and S&P 500 futures gained 7 points or 0.3%.
Trade-related worries died down slightly after better-than-expected Chinese data calmed investors, defying the increasing pressure from U.S. tariffs. China’s exports rose 3.3% in July, while imports fell 5.6% on the year, less than expected. The data helped ease concerns over a currency war after China let its yuan slide to its lowest in over a decade.

576,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 05:31AM ET</span>","Chinese bears see trade war worsening, flee to safe havens, derivatives","By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Many Chinese investors are piling into products that provide a hedge against a stock market collapse, convinced now that the Sino-U.S. trade war will drag on and, if anything, intensify.
The dramatic shattering of a month-long truce between Beijing and Washington this month has dashed hopes of a trade deal, and these investors are bracing for more bad news, such as further sanctions on Chinese companies, pressure on ratings agencies to downgrade China’s credit rating and even moves to drive up the price of oil.
Wee May Ling, a Singapore-based investment manager at Janus Henderson Investors, said sentiment changed swiftly this week as China's currency fell and Chinese firms stopped purchases of U.S. farm products.
""There is realization that this is going to be protracted, long-drawn out and there is no easy solution because the fight is about intellectual property, technological superiority as well as geopolitical issues,"" she said.
Xie Donghai, chairman of Shanghai Entropy Asset Management, said the heightened uncertainty would translate into market turbulence.
""We will closely monitor various signals, and further reduce risk exposure,"" Xie said, adding that hedge fund managers would also adopt strategies that seek to profit from higher volatility.
Investors are positioning for these tail risks in instruments such as options and exchange-traded products that make money if stock markets fall. They are also diverting cash into gold and safe-haven bonds.
Outstanding contracts of put equity options in China - a form of insurance against a drop in Shanghai's SSE50 index (SSE50) - rose to a record 1.5 million this week. Outstanding contracts in China's stock index futures, another risk-hedging tool, hit this year's high.

GRAPHIC: Outstanding stock index futures hit this year's high - https://tmsnrt.rs/2MNTzQw
Chinese bond prices have also jumped to multi-year highs.
In Hong Kong, leveraged and inverse exchange-traded funds, that reward investors when markets collapse, have seen record buying. An inverse fund product managed by CSOP Asset Management (HK:7500) that allows investors to capitalize on the downside of the benchmark Hang Seng index (HSI) saw record turnover and a jump in assets under management (AUM). The risk-off sentiment also drove net inflows into CSOP's money market funds.
""The sanguine mood suddenly turned bearish,"" said Yuan Yuwei, investment advisor at Olympus Hedge Fund Investments Co, who said he bought stock options to insure against a likely drop in share prices when the trade tensions flared.
TRIGGER COMPETITIVE DEVALUATION
This week, as China allowed its heavily managed currency to fall through a symbolic 7-per-dollar level and Washington accused it of currency manipulation, concerns spread that the trade war could turn into a financial war.
""Currency depreciation ... if not managed properly, could eventually turn into a financial crisis,"" Yuan said. ""Such risks should be taken into consideration,"" he said.
Liu Haiying, founder of Shanghai-based Haiying Investment, said he fears that China's move to let the yuan depreciate could trigger competitive devaluation among exporting nations. A rush to adopt ""beggar thy neighbor"" policies would hurt Chinese exporters, trigger fresh concerns about growth, and heap more pressure on the yuan, he said.
To be sure, some of these views are far more bearish than mainstream opinion in China from state-controlled brokerages, long-only fund managers, or official media. They also contrast with the People's Bank of China's repeated claims that China's economy is resilient and the yuan will be stable.
But investors are running for cover. China's benchmark CSI300 stock index (CSI300) has plunged nearly 5% this month, while 10-year treasuries hit a low not seen since January, 2017.
""That partly seems to reflect growing concerns market players are starting to price in on China's political and economic turbulences,"" said Masanari Takada, cross asset strategist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo, adding those concerns also reflected risks from the political chaos in Hong Kong.
Already there are signs that sharply shrinking risk appetite is driving money away from emerging markets, including China.
Between August 1 and August 6, $6.8 billion in non-resident flows left emerging markets, according to the Institute of International Finance.
China saw more than $2 billion in non-resident equity outflows during this period, with nearly $1 billion in outflows on August 2 alone, following U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of new tariffs.
Ning Zhu, professor of Finance at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance (SAIF) said he's confident in Beijing's ability to manage expectations and avoid a free-fall in the yuan. With strict capital controls in place, foreign currency reserves exceeding $3 trillion, and tools to thwart yuan short-sellers, Zhu doesn't expect panic-selling in the Chinese currency. Nevertheless, Zhu sees long-term downward pressure on the yuan, due to China's frothy asset prices, slowing growth, and the country's massive debt pile.
""There are fewer and fewer drivers for the yuan to appreciate,"" he said, adding that China should speed up painful reforms to reinvigorate growth to prop up its currency."

While that may be a bit of a bummer for bulls, some strategists see an opportunity.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). likes buying call options, derivatives that make money when a stock’s price rises, on companies that have underperformed over the past week and where the firm sees upside. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) has a U.S. strategy group that is picking stocks relatively insulated to the macro environment, and an Asia team bullish on defensives.
“The U.S.-China trade war has now escalated into a potential currency war,” BofAML U.S. strategists led by Savita Subramanian wrote in a note Aug. 7. “With trade drama heating up, macro is now impacting micro: earnings revisions and guidance reflect weakening corporate confidence.”
Subramanian’s group recommends stocks that have limited exposure to trade but leadership in market share, such as Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc.
Goldman strategists including Vishal Vivek and John Marshall in an Aug. 7 note recommend buying calls on the likes of NetApp Inc (NASDAQ:NTAP)., Deere & Co. and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT), which make their list of companies that endured last week’s market sell-off and have upside potential.
Investors have been whipsawed in recent days amid tit-for-tat announcements about trade. President Donald Trump said last week the U.S. would impose tariffs on a further $300 billion in Chinese imports as of Sept. 1, and China promised to retaliate.
The yuan sinking below the key level of 7 to the dollar fueled fears that the trade tiff would morph into a currency war. Bonds yields globally have reached new lows amid concern about the health of the world economy. Still, some strategist say this is an opportunity to buy more stocks.
BofAML’s Asia strategists led by Ajay Singh Kapur suggest both stocks to purchase and some to avoid. Defensive buy ideas include Altium Ltd. and Shenzhou International Group Holdings Ltd., while their cyclical underperform-rated names include Great Wall Motor Co., Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corp. and Keppel Corp."

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets edged higher for a second straight day Thursday, after another volatile day on Wall Street ended with a rally after the European close.
The bounce, however, remains underwhelming, against a backdrop of mounting fears for the global economy, and for the European one in particular. Despite a solid 0.8% rise in early trading to 371.66, the benchmark Stoxx 600 is still down over 4% in the last week. The U.K. FTSE 100 is still down over 5% despite inching 0.1% higher and of Europe’s main boards, only Spain’s IBEX 35 has lost less than 3% since the start of the month.
Government bond yields have risen slightly from the record lows that they hit on Wednesday, but still remain far below zero. The German 10-year yield fell as low at -0.61% at the worst of Wednesday’s panic and is still trading at -0.56%.
The “lower for longer” interest rate environment again dragged on bank stocks, with Unicredit (MI:CRDI), ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) all adding to Wednesday’s losses, joined in the red by   Societe Generale   (PA:SOGN),   Credit Agricole   (PA:CAGR),   Bankia   (MC:BKIA) and ING Group (AS:INGA).
Other big movers included U.K. based asset manager   Hargreaves   Lansdown (LON:HRGV), which rose 6.3% after reporting better-than-expected flows of new money in the wake of its embarrassment with fund manager Neil Woodford. HL had pushed Woodford’s funds aggressively to clients before they were hit by his decision to suspend redemptions after running into trouble with illiquid and hard-to-value investments. One of Woodford’s biggest investments, litigation funder Burford Capital (LON:BURF), fell by nearly half on Wednesday after short-seller Muddy Waters detailed what it said were flaws in its accounting.
Elsewhere, however, there was a touch of relief after China’s monthly trade data showed both exports and imports faring better than expected. Analysts at ING warned that the data contained some odd-looking anomalies, such as a rise in oil exports, which may suggest that the underlying picture isn’t as rosy.
However, the figures were enough to stabilize the yuan in market trading, while China’s central bank took the widely-expected step of fixing the onshore rate at above 7 to the dollar for the first time since 2008.
“China is working hard to avoid excessive (yuan) weakening and resulting currency tensions,” said Robin Brooks, an economist with the Institute of International Finance in Washington, via Twitter.
Trade war fears helped undermine sportswear group Adidas (DE:ADSGN) again, despite the German company reporting wider profit margins and a solid 4% rise in currency-adjusted sales. Elsewhere in Germany, Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) rose 2.6% after moving closer to a breakup with the announcement that it has put three more underperforming businesses – two of them badly hit by the weakness of the automotive sector - under review."

Nestle last year paid $7.15 billion for exclusive rights to sell the U.S. chain's coffees and teas globally, and began selling Starbucks-labelled products in Europe, Asia and Latin America in February.
The world's largest food company will start selling 21 Starbucks-branded capsule and instant coffee products on Chinese e-commerce platforms like Alibaba's (N:BABA) Tmall and JD.com (O:JD), as well as to offices and hotels in tier-1 cities, both companies said. 
""We believe China is the most exciting market in general but especially for coffee because... per capita cup consumption is quite low as compared to Asia,"" said Rashid Aleem Qureshi, Nestle's chief executive officer for the Greater China region. 
""Right now the overall soluble coffee in China is growing between 3-5% (a year) and we believe that by bringing this exciting new business opportunity we should be able to grow faster than that,"" he said, referring to a category that includes capsule and instant coffee. 
Nestle's move comes as the Swiss company experienced a slower first-half growth in China, its second-largest market, where other categories like mainstream baby foods have struggled compared to pricier options.
China's per capita coffee consumption is about 6 cups a year, compared to 400 in Japan and 300 in South Korea, Nestle said. 
The partnership with Starbucks would help Nestle add a premium coffee option to the range of products it already sells in China, such as Nescafe instant coffee range and Nespresso capsule coffees, Qureshi said. 

Starbucks China CEO Belinda Wong said the Nestle deal would open two new avenues to sell its products in China, where it has been investing heavily in its store network and delivery amid tougher competition from local startups.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportwear company Adidas (DE:ADSGn) reported disappointing second-quarter sales on Thursday but expects a recovery in the second half after it stemmed a decline in Europe and saw its long-struggling Reebok brand recover.
Adidas shares fell 2.3% by 0725 GMT. The stock had rallied in recent weeks on hopes it might lift its outlook - particularly after German rival Puma (DE:PUMG) raised its sales and profit forecasts following a strong second quarter.
""Given the recent rerating in the shares since April and narrowing valuation gap versus peers, the lack of a sales or earnings beat is unusual and brand momentum remains concerning,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote of Adidas.
Second-quarter sales rose a currency-adjusted 4% to 5.51 billion euros ($6.18 billion), shy of average analyst forecasts for 5.54 billion as the company saw a strong decline in the soccer category a year on from the World Cup.
Adidas had already warned in March that supply chain issues would hit sales growth in the first half, citing particular problems meeting North America demand for mid-market clothing.
Adidas has eroded Nike's dominance of the U.S. market in recent years, pushing retro styles and teaming up with celebrities such as Kanye West and Beyonce.
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) has responded by ramping up spending on marketing, with its sales rising a currency-adjusted 10% in the quarter ended May 31, driven by a rise of 22% in Greater China and 9% in Europe, Middle East and Africa.
Adidas quarterly sales were flat in Europe, recovering from a 3% fall in the first quarter after the firm took steps to reduce its reliance on its Originals fashion line and boost sales of sports performance gear, with new product launches.
Group sales rose 14% in China and 6% in North America.
Adidas said it was confident sales would accelerate in the second half, allowing it to confirm a full-year outlook for currency-neutral sales growth of 5-8% and net income from continuing operations of between 1.88 and 1.95 billion euros.
Quarterly net profit from continuing operations rose 10% to 462 million, helped by another quarter of strong growth for ecommerce, where sales rose 37%. Margins are higher for online sales than wholesale.
Reebok sales rose 3%, driven by the popularity of retro styles, particularly in North America, where the brand expanded 10%, and in emerging markets."

The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) said Westpac and its units will have to pay a fine of A$1.5 million ($1.02 million), the maximum payable for the breach.
Westpac and its two units were late in submitting data pertaining to financial statistics for the quarter ended March 31, and for the month of March. The units were also late in April, APRA said in a statement.
""APRA wants to send a strong message to industry that compliance with our reporting standards is mandatory, and cannot be considered secondary to other business priorities,"" APRA Deputy Chair John Lonsdale said.
An independent government report last month told the regulator to be more forceful, and added that the body may need more resources to help it.
Westpac, in an emailed statement, said it now has processes in place to deliver all required data by the APRA on time and it ""regrets"" not doing so in the incidents mentioned.
APRA's move highlights the scrutiny regulators have come under recently to take a larger and more proactive role in cleaning up the country's financial sector after widespread wrongdoing was found by a year-long inquiry.

SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has approved export of a high-tech material to South Korea for the first time since imposing tighter curbs last month, but doubled down on political pressure and warned it could broaden restrictions on shipments to its Asian neighbor.
The approval and subsequent warning illustrate how Tokyo is upping the ante in the diplomatic row while at the same time is unwilling to unilaterally stop exports to South Korea. 
The dispute, rooted in their wartime past and exacerbated by the recent tightening of curbs on shipments of three high-tech components, has stoked nationalism and raised trade concerns.
Relations between the two U.S. allies worsened late in 2018 as part of a decades-old dispute over compensation for forced laborers during Japan's occupation. South Korea has invoked its difficult history with Japan, which colonized the Korean peninsula during World War Two.
South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, said on Thursday that tighter curbs would undermine Japan's international credibility and accused Tokyo of using its industrial advantage as a weapon against another country.
""The measures so far undermine the trust of the free trade order and the international division of labor,"" Moon said.
""Even if there are any gains, it will be short-lived. In the end it is a game without winners, where everyone, including Japan itself, becomes a victim.""
The latest export approval followed ""strict examination"", Japanese ministers said, cautioning that Tokyo could consider expanding its controls beyond the three high-tech materials.
""If improper use of exports are found beyond three high-tech materials, we will implement thorough steps to prevent recurrence including expanding application examination,"" Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko said.
Seko said Japan does not usually announce each export approval but did so this time after South Korea described Japan's recent curbs as an ""embargo"" on shipments.
South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said Tokyo had allowed the export of EUV photoresists, a chemical crucial for Samsung's advanced contract chipmaking production.
Samsung (KS:005930) declined to comment.
WHITE LIST
Japan has removed South Korea from the ""white list"" of countries with fast-track trade status, meaning some exporters may have to go through a lengthy permit application process to ship restricted items to South Korea.
That covers a broad range of items, including those applicable to weapons production and machine tools.
South Korea was scheduled to take a call on its plan to drop Japan from a similar ""white list"" of countries on Thursday, but trade ministry officials said the plan had been put off until further discussions.
Japanese officials have cited unspecified security reasons for their export curbs. But they have pointed to an erosion of trust after South Korean court rulings last year ordered Japanese firms to compensate wartime forced laborers.
Japan says the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral ties.
Given the curbs in place, Japan's approval to export the three materials could take up to 90 days, slowing shipments. 
Shares of Tokyo Ohka Kogyo rose 3.9% and Stella Chemifa surged 10.1% after the latest approval. Tokyo Ohka Kogyo makes photoresists and Stella Chemifa produces hydrogen fluoride, both materials affected by the export curbs.
But it remains unclear if the initial approval from Tokyo signals a breakthrough in trade relations.
""They approved only one out of a number of items, and they said they would approve exports for pure civilian purposes,"" a South Korean senior trade ministry official told Reuters.

South Korean chipmakers are hitting a dead end in their quest to find alternatives for key Japanese materials that have been hit with export restrictions, raising the prospect of major disruption to their operations in coming months.
Of particular concern is sourcing of hydrogen fluouride, a key chipmaking material. 
South Korean chipmakers have been desperate for Japan's high-purity hydrogen fluoride because it helps them get high ""yield"" rates, which is critical to making chips profitably.

586,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 03:11AM ET</span>",Venture capital fuels Latam 'unicorns' expansion beyond borders,"By Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Surging venture capital investment in Latin American startups has financed international expansion across the region and beyond, as business models that do not require large amounts of capital have helped many firms avoid silos common in the region.
New venture capital funding in the region quadrupled over two years to a record $2 billion in 2018, according to the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America. And that total has already been matched in the first seven months of 2019.
Analysts say fundraising rounds this year could double 2018's total, thanks to Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), which launched its $5 billion Latin America fund in March, the region's biggest-ever venture capital deployment.
SoftBank's investments this year have helped to mint a new wave of Latin ""unicorns,"" or tech startups valued at more than $1 billion, with high expectations hinging on their potential beyond their headquarter countries.
André Maciel, managing partner at the SoftBank Latin America Fund, sees huge potential for such companies to tackle regional barriers to productivity. China had an 8.8% annual productivity growth since 1990 and India has had 5%, whereas Brazil has had a 1.3% rate in the same period, according to McKinsey data.
""There is a great opportunity for regional startups that are bridging this productivity gap with tech,"" Maciel said in an interview at SoftBank Group's Sao Paulo headquarters.
A pair of U.S. initial public offerings last year valuing Brazilian fintechs  StoneCo Ltd  (O:STNE) and  PagSeguro Digital  Ltd (N:PAGS) at close to $20 billion combined dramatized how far the Latin American startup scene has come.
The added attention has brought a burst of funding from investors seeking synergies in their global portfolios, with China's Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), for example, taking a stake in Brazilian financial startup Nubank.
""Our companies in Latin America, for instance, can learn and benefit from the expertise of our Asian companies,"" Maciel said.
GRAPHIC - Latam Venture Capital: https://tmsnrt.rs/2GSR6kc
LOOKING ABROAD
Latin American startups flush with fresh capital are also eager to tap additional markets.
While Brazilian banks have struggled to post strong returns from acquisitions abroad, local fintechs are hoping their online platforms will cross borders more seamlessly.
Nubank has opened offices in Mexico and Argentina, while lending platform Creditas, which raised $231 million in a SoftBank-led funding round last month, plans to expand into Mexico and opened a research and development center in Spain. 
Colombian delivery app Rappi has ramped up operations in Mexico and Argentina, with plans to use most of the $1 billion it raised from SoftBank to expand in Brazil.
In the case of Brazil's Gympass, which sells flexible gym memberships to companies as an employee perk, its multinational clients encouraged it to expand not just in the Latin America but across Europe and the United States, said executive Marco Crespo.
The fitness startup, which clinched unicorn status with a $300 million round led by SoftBank in June, now operates in 14 European countries and several U.S. cities, serving clients including  Unilever  PLC (L:ULVR) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
Most of its affiliated gyms are now outside Brazil, with just 22,000 of the total 47,000 in its home country.
Other firms are counting on unique tech solutions to address global concerns such as privacy. 
In Loco, an indoor geolocation services startup founded by computer science students in northeastern Brazil, is opening an office in New York and appealing to U.S. clients by turning the data it analyzes into anonymous profiles to address privacy concerns. The company announced a $20 million funding round on Wednesday to finance its U.S. expansion.
""Brazil has become a beta market for the world,"" said Scott Sobel, founder of Valor Capital, a venture capital fund that owns stakes in Gympass and In Loco.
Even smaller investors are pushing for the international expansion of their invested companies. Pedro Sirotsky Melzer, founder of e.Bricks Ventures, a fund that has deployed around $75 million, has seen one of the companies in its portfolio, Infracommerce, a Brazilian startup providing e-commerce solutions, expand into Argentina.

588,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 01:58AM ET</span>","Asia stocks find solace in China trade surprise, yuan's fix","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares were trying to piece together a rally on Thursday as Beijing reported surprisingly solid trade numbers while also limiting the fall in its yuan, offering a brief respite from fears of a global currency war.
Data showed Chinese exports rose 3.3% in July from a year earlier, when analysts had looked for a fall of 2%. Imports also declined by less than expected, suggesting some resilience to the drawn-out Sino-U.S. tariff struggle.
Beijing helped by fixing the yuan at a firmer level than many had feared, even though it was beyond 7 per dollar level for the first time since the global financial crisis.
Markets reacted by paring a little of their recent hefty losses. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan bounced 0.9%, though it was still down more than 7% over the past two weeks.
Japan's Nikkei edged up 0.5%, and away from seven-month lows, while Chinese blue chips rose 1.2%. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.5% and EUROSTOXX futures 1%.
Investors have increasingly come to fear the trade war will prove protracted enough to tip the world into recession, and have piled into bonds and gold as a hedge.
""Financial markets are raising risks of recession,"" said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Joseph Lupton.
""Equities continue to slide and volatility has spiked, but the alarm bell is loudest in rates markets, where the yield curve inverted the most since just before the start of the financial crisis.""
Yields on U.S. 30-year bonds dived as deep as 2.123% overnight, not far from an all-time low of 2.089% set in 2016. Ten-year yields dropped further below three-month rates, an inversion that has reliably predicted recessions in the past.
The latest spasm began when central banks in New Zealand, India and Thailand surprised markets on Wednesday with aggressive easings, while the Philippines is expected to cut later on Thursday.
FED TO THE RESCUE?
""The decision by these APAC central banks to 'go hard and early' has provided further fuel to concerns of a global recession,"" said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank. ""This also means that the Fed will need to come to the rescue.""
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans signaled on Wednesday he was open to lower rates to bolster inflation and counter risks to economic growth from trade tensions.
Futures moved to price in a 100% probability of a Fed easing in September and a near 24% chance of a half-point cut. Some 75 basis points of easing is implied by January, with rates ultimately reaching 1%.
Dire data on German industrial output stoked concerns Europe might already be in recession and pushed bund yields deeper into negative territory.
All of which fueled speculation that the major central banks would also have to take drastic action, if only to prevent an export-crimping rise in their currencies.
The Bank of Japan would be under particular pressure as the yen has gained sharply from the flood to safe havens, leaving it at 106.16 per dollar from 109.30 just a week ago.
The euro has also bounced to $1.1208, from a two-year trough of $1.1025, while the U.S. dollar index has backtracked to 97.542, from a recent peak of 98.932.
New Zealand's dollar was still picking up the pieces after sliding as much as 2.6% on Wednesday when the country's central bank slashed rates by a steep 50 basis points and flagged the risk of negative rates.
The kiwi was huddled at $0.6456, down 1.1% for the week.
The rapid decline in yields helped lift gold above $1,500 for the first time since 2013. Spot gold was last at $1,500.30 per ounce, having been as far as $1,510 on Wednesday. The precious metal is up 16% since May.
Oil prices regained some ground as talk that Saudi Arabia was weighing options to halt crude's descent helped offset a build in stockpiles and fears of slowing demand.
Brent crude futures climbed $1.69 to $57.92, though that followed steep losses on Wednesday, while U.S. crude rose $1.64 to $52.73 a barrel."
589,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 01:41AM ET</span>",Australia's Treasury Wine rejects report alleging it inflated profit,"By Nikhil Nainan
(Reuters) - Treasury Wine Estates (AX:TWE) rejected on Thursday a research report that alleged the Australian firm may have improperly inflated its pretax profits by as much as 50% over the past two years, or by about A$300 million ($203 million) cumulatively.
Hong Kong-based GMT Research said in an Aug. 7 report that profits at the world's largest standalone winemaker were inflated following its purchase of most of Diageo's (L:DGE) wine business in 2016.
The report alleged that the maker of Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Lindemans wines wrote down the acquired inventory from the  Diageo  deal to inflate future profits. Treasury Wine bought the British company's local and U.S. wine units. 
It also went on to engage in ""channel-stuffing"", a tactic used by firms where they box up more products for retailers to sell than they are able to, and accordingly boost their sales and earnings, the report said.
Treasury Wine said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange the report was ""false and misleading"", and that it would respond specifically to the claims when it announced its preliminary annual results on August 15.
It did not respond to separate questions from Reuters about the specific allegations made in the report.
Treasury shares recovered from a 7.7% drop in morning trade after the company's rejection of the claims, climbing as much as 1.8% to A$16.85. The benchmark Australian stock index (AXJO) was up 0.5%. 
GMT said that Treasury bundled its less popular wines with their more popular ones, like Penfolds, although it added that verifying these claims were ""difficult"".
""It seems likely that TWE has taken advantage of acquisition accounting with the purchase of Diageo Wine to inflate profits... although the benefits are now likely winding down,"" GMT wrote. 
It also noted a recent short call by a U.S.-based hedge fund manager in May, who told a popular conference that her call was based on the company indulging in channel stuffing and bundled distribution.
Treasury Wine shares came under pressure following that short call, and the declines were exacerbated by a company filing that revealed its Chief Executive Officer had sold some of his shares just a week before the comments. 
In Thursday's ASX release, Treasury Wine also reaffirmed its guidance for the year. 
GMT Research said investors should avoid the stock, and that it sees a 35% downside to the winemaker's share price at A$10.6 based on the findings of its report.
GMT, which says it does not trade in the stocks it writes about, has previously issued reports questioning accounting practices of companies including Malaysia's AirAsia Bhd (KL:AIRA) and China's  Xinyi Glass  Holdings (HK:0868).
""We note Treasury Wine's response to our report but do not intend to comment further at this time,"" it told Reuters.

S&P 500 Index futures contracts expiring in September rose 0.2% as of 11:30 a.m. in Tokyo, rebounding from an earlier 0.4% loss after the People’s Bank of China set its daily reference rate at 7.0039 per dollar.

SEOUL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Samsung unveiled a new version of the Galaxy Note smartphone on Wednesday with fast 5G network connection and improved camera features, hoping the premium model helps it revive slumping profit and widen the gap with struggling rival Huawei. 
 Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) has emerged as the biggest beneficiary of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's trouble in the second quarter with a nearly 7% jump in smartphone sales, as the Chinese firm sold fewer phones in the global market after it was put on a U.S. trade blacklist in May.
With emphasis on improved video and photography features, which helped Huawei become the world's No.2 smartphone vendor, Samsung hopes the Galaxy Note 10 will appeal to YouTubers and fans of social media. 
Along with its first foldable phone, the big-screen Note 10, unveiled at an event in New York on Wednesday, is the South Korean tech firm's most important new product planned in the second half of this year to expand its mobile sales.
With two screen sizes of 6.3 inches and 6.8 inches, the Note 10 boasts enhanced video effects such as augmented reality and stabilization modes, and a front-facing camera centrally located at the top of the display for better selfies. It lacks a headphone jack, a tweak Apple Inc (O:AAPL) made to its smartphones three years ago.
The Note 10 will be sold starting at $949.99 while the bigger Note 10 plus will start at $1,099. The Note 10 model with 5G capability will start at $1,299.99. 
The phone will go on sale from Aug. 23 and square off against Apple's latest iPhones, which are widely expected to come out later this year.
Samsung declined to disclose its sales target for the new Note series, but said it expected to achieve higher sales volume than the predecessor Note 9 models.
Analysts expect similar shipments of about 9.6 million units, with price likely to be the most important factor in a weak market. The global smartphone market shrank 3% in the June quarter, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.
""It is hard to expect strong sales for the new Note with just a few upgrades in its camera features,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.
Samsung is reeling from sagging profits in its mobile division due to weak sales of flagship models, even as it boosted overall shipments by 6.7% and stayed on top with market share of 22% in the second quarter.

Its first foldable phone, the Galaxy Fold, is set to go on sale from September, but analysts say headlines about glitches with sample Folds will dampen consumer excitement around the launch.

597,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 09:02PM ET</span>",Silver lining to U.S. market sell-off: Fundamentals still seem to matter,"By David Randall and Noel Randewich
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies posting strong earnings are still winning laurels from investors, even amid the broad stock sell-off over the last week, suggesting that the kind of indiscriminate selling seen the last time an apparent devaluation of China's yuan spooked global markets is far from imminent. 
High-flying stocks like  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG),  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and semiconductor equipment maker KLA Corp (O:KLAC) are all up 8% or more so far in the third quarter, after the companies posted strong earnings and forecasts, extending rallies that have lifted each company's shares by 40% or more since the start of the year. The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX), meanwhile, has shed 2.3% since the start of the quarter as fears of a currency war between the United States and China lead more investors to question the strength of the global economy.
China allowed its currency to weaken past the key 7-per-dollar level on Monday for the first time in more than a decade, in response to the threat of a new round of punishing U.S. tariffs. The United States, in turn, labeled China a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994. A similar unexpected depreciation in the yuan in 2015 pushed the S&P 500 to the edge of a bear market. 
The recent selloff has left the S&P 500 down nearly 5% from its record high close on July 26, with the technology index down over 6%. The S&P 500 ended Wednesday up 0.08% after spending most of the day in negative territory. 
Graphic: S&P 500 sectors since July 26 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2MMf44w
Bank stocks and other financials took an additional hit on Tuesday, hurt by increased expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates three more times by year-end.
Graphic: S&P 500 vs banks since July 26 high - https://tmsnrt.rs/2YDgK7D
Still, portfolio managers and strategists say that although the S&P 500 posted its worst day of the year on Monday, the market continues to reward companies that have strong fundamentals.
""There are fewer clear winning growth companies and in large cap there are fewer really attractive consumer names than a few years ago,"" said Barbara Miller, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. ""The companies that are stronger fundamentally are pulling forward a little bit if they are in categories with any macro volatility."" 
Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management, described the market as ""stick-to-what's-working,"" saying that ""we're nowhere near a capitulation.
""If we get any sort of trade truce talk you could see the market rip from here and go up to its previous highs,"" Nixon said. 
Overall, companies are weathering the market sell-off roughly in proportion to their corporate results. Among the companies that have posted earnings since the S&P 500 touched its record high on July 26, the share prices of those that beat earnings estimates by 30 percent or more are down only 3 percent on average, while companies that missed expectations are down 7 percent on average, according to Refinitiv data. 
S&P 500 companies whose full-year earnings per share estimates have been raised by analysts this reporting season have also outperformed since the index began its drop from the July 26 record high, reflecting investors' greater confidence in those companies earnings. 
Graphic: Earnings estimates revisions - https://tmsnrt.rs/2YxoQhG
Earnings per share are up 2.7% for the S&P 500 as a whole for companies that have reported second-quarter results, with roughly 73% beating analyst estimates. 
""The underlying reality is that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain remarkably okay and earnings continue to outpace people's worst fears,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at independent investment research firm The Leuthold Group. 
By comparison, the deep drops in share prices in August 2015 in the wake of the last unexpected decline in the yuan coincided with a global manufacturing recession that helped crater the price of oil and other commodities, Paulsen said.

598,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 08:31PM ET</span>","Medina Mora, powerful Citigroup exec who battled scandals, dies at 69","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Manuel Medina Mora, one of the most influential Mexican bankers to work on Wall Street during a long career at  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), has died, the bank's Mexican unit Citibanamex said on Wednesday. He was 69.
Citibanamex said Medina Mora died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a form of motor neuron disease. Earlier, the bank had said multiple sclerosis was the cause of death.
Medina Mora was a powerful executive at what became Citi's most important foreign unit, credited with turning a laggard Mexican lender into a lifeboat for the large U.S. bank as it rebounded from the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
However, money laundering and loan fraud scandals at the Mexican unit tarnished his legacy, even as he managed to keep a hold on power and run the bank at arm's length from New York.
Citi bought the lender, known as Banamex, in 2001 and the unit came to account for about 15% of the parent company's global consumer revenue by 2016, when Medina Mora resigned.
Medina Mora was the third generation in his family to work at Banamex, according to prominent businessman Alfredo Harp Helu, and had the nickname ""Mr. Mexico"" within Citigroup. In 2016, the Mexican subsidiary was renamed Citibanamex.
Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat paid tribute to Medina Mora, saying he had been a ""mentor to many"" and helped turn the business into one global franchise.
""Manuel was a pillar of Mexico's business community yet his impact extended well beyond his home country,"" Corbat said in a statement, expressing his sadness at Medina Mora's passing.
Seen as an effective manager who smartly navigated internal affairs, Medina Mora was described by powerbrokers who knew him as a brilliant and respected banker. Under his leadership, Banamex, one of the oldest Mexican banks in continuous operation, became Mexico's second-largest bank with more than $26 billion in deposits and over 1,000 branches.
However, a series of scandals damaged his reputation, leading to a significant pay cut in 2014, and likely contributed to his retirement in 2016.
In 2014, loans made to a Mexican company backed by bogus work orders from state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], or Pemex, cost Citi more than $500 million. In addition, anti-money laundering issues and soured loans created hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.
Medina Mora started as an intern at the bank in 1971, working his way up to lead the privatization of Banamex in 1991. He became chief executive of the resulting Banamex-Accival Financial Group in 1996, before eventually running Citi in Latin America in 2004 and heading its global consumer banking business in 2010."

(Reuters) - The massive U.S. bond market rally has not been a boon for all types of fixed-income securities.
Some $8.4 trillion in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae have been rocked by the swift decline in bond yields on worries that a wave of mortgage refinancing would erode the value of these bonds.
In the first four trading days in August, MBS have only managed 0.46% in total return, while all U.S. investment-grade bonds have already delivered a 1.27% gain, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""This is not a good look for mortgages,"" said Walt Schmidt, senior vice president and manager of the mortgage strategies group at FTN Financial.
While they offer higher yields than Treasuries, MBS are ""negatively convexed,"" which means their prices fall when bond yields fall or rise quickly.
Treasury yields have tumbled since last week in the wake of the escalation in trade tensions between China and the United States. U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields (US10YT=RR) have fallen 0.30 percentage point in a week.
Last Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports in a bid to pressure Beijing for a trade deal.
China retaliated on Monday by letting its currency weaken to 7 yuan to the dollar, a level not seen in a decade. This led to the U.S. Treasury Department to label China as a currency manipulator.
Anxiety about a flood of refinancing was stoked by data released by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday that showed loan applications for home refinancing hitting their highest level since November 2006 as some 30-year home borrowing costs fell to their lowest levels in the same time frame.
""We fully expect that refinance volume will jump even higher this week given the further drop in rates,"" Mike Fratantoni, MBA's chief economist said.
More refinancing reduces the values of MBS because their holders are paid back earlier than they had expected and would have to reinvest their money at lower yields.
Data released on Wednesday showed MBS prepayments sped up in July from a pickup in refinancing due to falling mortgage rates, analysts said.
The deep decline in Treasury yields has led to some buying of Treasuries and increased receiving in the interest rate swaps on Wednesday by mortgage servicers and investors in a bid to offset the expected drop in income on their MBS holdings, analysts said."

Insurers in Canada have been increasingly pivoting toward Asia for growth, looking to sell to the region's middle class as domestic markets face stiff competition.
The company's Asia unit reported a nearly 15% rise in core earnings to $471 million, while its domestic and U.S. businesses slipped. 
However, the Asia business saw a marginal decline in annualized premium equivalent (APE) sales. 
Canada APE sales jumped 46% to C$290 million, while in the United States it rose 19.4% to C$154 million.
The company's total APE sales rose 9.2% to C$1.36 billion.
Last week, rival Sun Life Financial Inc reported a 1.4% rise in second-quarter profit, with a 1% rise in Asia sales and a drop in United States and Canada units.
Manulife said core earnings rose to C$1.45 billion ($1.09 billion), or 72 Canadian cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from C$1.43 billion, or 70 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. (https://reut.rs/2YT2pPm)

SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico got its third governor in less than a week on Wednesday just hours after the bankrupt U.S. territory's supreme court ruled that Pedro Pierluisi's assumption of the office was unconstitutional and ordered him to leave.
The island's justice secretary, Wanda Vazquez, was sworn in as governor at the supreme court in San Juan.
A unanimous decision by the nine-member high court nullified Pierluisi's governorship based on the fact his earlier appointment as secretary of state and next in line for governor had not been confirmed by both chambers of the legislature.
Vazquez last week initially voiced reluctance to take over the island's top government post after being targeted by protesters for alleged corruption and being too close to disgraced Governor Ricardo Rossello, who left office last Friday.
In a statement after becoming governor, Vazquez said: ""I will continue to focus on putting (Puerto Rico) back on track in an orderly and peaceful way.""
The high court's ruling followed weeks of political turmoil with Rossello resigning after of days of protests demanding he step down. 
Offensive chat messages between Rossello and his closest allies and federal corruption charges against two former members of his administration sparked the protests, which drew around a third of the island's 3.2 million people to the streets.
More political changes could be coming as newspaper El Nuevo Dia, citing unnamed sources, reported on Wednesday that Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's nonvoting representative in the U.S. Congress, could become the next secretary of state and eventual governor. The move has the blessing of legislative leaders, according to the report.
PIERLUISI LEAVES OFFICE
Pierluisi, who was given until 5 p.m. local time (2100 GMT) by the court to vacate the office, said he ""must step aside and support"" Vazquez.
""This is a time when we must all unite for Puerto Rico, leaving behind any partisan, ideological or personal agendas,"" he said in a statement.
After agreeing to resign, Rossello on July 31 named Pierluisi, an attorney and the island's former congressional representative, as secretary of state and his hand-picked successor.
The selection of Pierluisi was controversial mainly because he formerly gave legal advice to the island's unpopular, federally created fiscal oversight board, which filed the government's bankruptcy in 2017.
Pierluisi was sworn in as governor last Friday following confirmation of his secretary of state appointment by only the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. On Sunday, Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz filed a lawsuit claiming his chamber's advice and consent duty under the island's constitution was usurped and Pierluisi should be removed from office.
Pierluisi had argued that under a 2005 law, his appointment did not require confirmation because the legislature was not in session at the time. 
But the court on Wednesday declared as unconstitutional the part of the law that allowed Pierluisi to be in a position to take over as governor without Senate confirmation.
The political uncertainty comes at a critical time in Puerto Rico's bankruptcy and as it seeks billions of dollars in federal funding for healthcare and recovery efforts from devastating 2017 hurricanes. 
In a statement following the court ruling, Puerto Rico's U.S. congressional representative, Gonzalez, said it is ""important to restore credibility in Washington by showing that we are able to govern ourselves according to our own constitution.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on Wednesday said it has finalized a decision to cover expensive cancer cell therapies sold by  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) and  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN).
CMS, which runs Medicare - the federal government's health plan for Americans 65 and older - said it will cover the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies when provided in healthcare facilities that have programs in place to track patient outcomes.
The nationwide decision clears up ""a lot of confusion"" about coverage and will help patients get access to the novel therapies, known as CAR-T, CMS Administrator Seema Verma said during a conference call with reporters on Wednesday.
The decision follows the agency's finalization last week of a proposal to raise its maximum CAR-T payment to 65% of estimated costs from 50%. Some hospitals will also be eligible for supplemental payments in certain cases.
Both Gilead's Yescarta and Novartis' Kymriah were approved in 2017 for certain kinds of lymphoma and leukemia. But government and private health plans have balked at their high price of at least $373,000 for a one-time treatment before hospital costs, which can bring the bill for a single patient to over a million dollars.
More than half of lymphoma patients eligible for CAR-T therapy are estimated to be covered by Medicare.
The agency said it will also cover the CAR-Ts for uses not approved in their labels, as long as they are recommended by CMS-approved medical guidelines.
The novel treatments remove a type of immune system cells from each individual patient and re-engineer them to better fight certain blood cancers, keeping nearly 40% of patients alive for more than two years, according to some studies."
604,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 06:44PM ET</span>",Your Money: What to do if you need to sell stocks now,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When stocks are volatile, conventional wisdom says to stay the course. But what if you have tuition due or a pending home purchase and you just really need to cash out? 
Even the experts can get caught unprepared. 
That is a lesson Jenny Van Leeuwen Harrington learned when she and her husband were planning to buy a house nearly 20 years ago. As a portfolio manager, Harrington was trying to sell stocks at the last possible moment to maximize gains. She was waiting in bed on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, for the markets to open. And then, of course, time stopped.
""When the markets reopened a few days later, they were down a huge percent. I took a bath,"" said Harrington, now CEO at Gilman Hill Asset Management in New York. 
Her takeaway: Do not mess around. 
If you need to cash out of investments right now, while stocks are likely to be on a wild ride, here are some things to consider: 
- Plan ahead, even a little bit
Ideally, if you have a big, scheduled payment coming up, you would plan ahead and move money from stocks to a high-yield money market account or other safer investments. ""The longer runway you have, the safer you will be when you have to take the money out,"" said Corbin Blackwell, a certified financial planner with Betterment, an online wealth management firm. 
Eighteen months to a year is ideal, but sometimes that can stretch longer. Financial planner Erika  Safran  (PA:SAF), who has her own firm in New York, has clients who have kept cash sitting around for two and a half years now, waiting to find their dream home. 
Even a few weeks can do the trick. If you are facing a situation like tuition due on Aug. 15, you could sell a third of the shares you need 10 days prior, then another third a few days after that and the remainder a few days before the deadline, according to JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.
You can also make selling decisions based on the balance you need, Kinahan said. So if tuition is $30,000, sell shares for half the amount a few months before, and then set high and low limits for selling the rest. 
- Choose carefully what to sell
Not all stocks in your investment portfolio are the same, so when you go to sell, do thorough research. Harrington spoke to a client this week who is raising cash. The client had three buckets to choose from with different tax implications. 
For the most part, if you want to minimize capital gains, sell the stock with the least embedded growth. 
When it comes to exchange-traded funds, your holdings might have a different cost basis if you bought shares over time. 
""You need to call and say 'I want to sell my highest-cost position so I can minimize taxes,'"" said Harrington.
Consider selling bonds at the moment instead of stocks, said Bill Northey, senior investment director for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. For that matter, look at alternatives like a home equity loan or portfolio line of credit to avoid selling altogether, Northey added.
- Be at peace
Even with Monday's drop of more than 760 points of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, stocks were still up 15% for the year as of Tuesday, said Northey, so it is not actually such an inopportune time to sell. 
You might not even be taking a loss, despite the headlines, because your cost basis could be much lower than today's price. 
""Keeping proper perspective is important despite the headlines,"" Northey said.
And remember that a 2% drop or rise in a day sounds dramatic, but it could be minimal on your actual investments. This week, one of Harrington's clients said she needs $20,000 to pay her granddaughter’s college tuition and wants to know when to sell. A market move of 2% up or down equals loss or gain of about $400 for her. 

""Bottom-line, once you know the number, get it done,"" Harrington said. ""And keep in mind that certificates of deposit and money market funds have 2% yields now. You can make real money by parking it.""

605,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 06:05PM ET</span>","Lyft adds more riders, quarterly revenue beats estimates","By Alexandria Sage and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) on Wednesday said a price war with rival Uber was easing, boosting shares of both companies and allowing Lyft to raise its outlook for the year and forecast a faster path to profitability.
Lyft said increased revenue per rider would lift both third-quarter sales and full-year revenue above Wall Street estimates. That sent Lyft shares up 5% and shares of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc up 3.8% in after-hour trade.
""We believe these price adjustments are an industry trend,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts said on a call with analysts. He said 2018 was likely the peak of losses for Lyft, an improvement from the company's previous target of reporting its biggest loss this year. 
Lyft shares temporarily turned negative after it announced plans to bring forward its lock-up period - the time after a public offering in which large shareholders are prohibited from selling shares - to Aug. 19 from Sept. 24.
Lyft estimated that about 257.6 million shares could become eligible for sale when the trading restrictions ended.
A loss of $2.23 per share in the quarter was worse than the $1.74 per-share loss expected, on average, by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Still, Lyft's raising its outlook for revenue and adjusted losses for the full year were ""welcome signs,"" said Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian. 
Lyft's 72% jump in revenue was fueled by more active riders, who spent about a quarter more than they had a year ago.
Roberts said that pricing for rides had become ""more rational"" in the quarter, meaning that Lyft spends less on promotions to beat rival Uber. He also said that the company was focused on profitable growth, rather than growth at all costs.
Shares of Lyft are down 25% since their market debut on March 29, erasing about $5 billion from its market capitalization, as investors continue to question whether the ride-hailing industry can be profitable.
Lyft and larger rival Uber, both loss-making, have historically relied on heavy subsidization to attract riders. While the companies last quarter reported signs that price competition was easing, both are also spending to expand services into areas including self-driving technology for Lyft and food delivery for Uber. 
On average, Lyft received $39.77 in revenue from each of its nearly 22 million active riders in its second quarter as a public company, a 22% rise in revenue per rider and 41% increase in riders over the same period in 2018.
Chief Executive Officer Logan Green said in a statement that 2019 losses would be ""better than previously expected."" 
Lyft has said its ride-hailing services would be profitable in the future, without giving any timeline, while also warning regulators that as a company it might continue posting losses as it invests heavily in self-driving cars, renting scooters and other ventures.
The company forecast third-quarter revenue of $900 million to $915 million, above the average analyst estimate of $840.9 million.
Lyft also raised its forecast for full-year revenue to between $3.47 billion and $3.5 billion, up from its prior range of $3.28 billion and $3.3 billion.
Its revenue in the second quarter rose 72% to $867.3 million, above the average analyst estimate of $809.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
But its net loss widened to $644.2 million from $178.9 million a year earlier as costs more than doubled to $1.54 billion from a year earlier. 
On a per share basis, it narrowed to $2.23 per share from $8.48 per share, a year earlier, as the number of outstanding shares rose.

Lyft, which beat Uber to go public first, operates in over 300 cities in the United States and Canada. Uber says it had over 30 million riders in 2018.

The company said its adjusted profit for the quarter was 62 cents per share, beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue, which rose nearly 5% to $2.51 billion in the quarter, also beat Wall Street expectations of $2.47 billion.
Rupert Murdoch's newly spun-off Fox Corp debuted on the Nasdaq in March following the $71 billion sale of Twenty-First Century Fox's film and television assets to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS).
It emerged a leaner, more nimble company seeking to build on its concentration of live news and sports, including  World Wrestling Entertainment  Inc (N:WWE) and Super Bowl LIV next February.
Overall revenue growth in Fox's fiscal fourth quarter was largely driven by a 7.4% increase in affiliate revenues, or the fees collected from cable and satellite operators and online distributors, to $1.41 billion.
Those increases were offset by a 6% decline in advertising revenues with fewer FIFA World Cup soccer matches, the company said. Sales in the broadcaster's cable network programming business rose 2.2% to $1.3 billion.
On Tuesday, Fox Entertainment said it would buy animation studio Bento Box Entertainment, which produces hits including Bob's Burgers. Financial terms were not disclosed.
Fox also said on Sunday it was spending $265 million for a 67% stake in Credible Labs Inc, an online consumer financial marketplace, and that it would invest up to another $75 million of growth capital over about two years.
In May, Fox spent more than $236 million for a nearly 5% percent equity stake in The Stars Group Inc (TO:TSGI) to build FOX Bet, a Fox-branded sports betting platform expected to launch this fall in U.S. states where sports wagering is legal.
The betting product is on track to launch before football season, said Chief Executive Officer Lachlan Murdoch during a call with analysts and investors on Wednesday.
Even last year before its spin-off had closed, Fox began pivoting into new companies. In September, it invested $100 million in new social broadcasting platform Caffeine TV and plans to launch a content studio jointly owned by Caffeine and FOX Sports.
Net income for the quarter fell to $454 million, or 73 cents per share, in the three months ended June 30, from $471 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier."

The Dow Jones industrials were off nearly 600 points by 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT) but recovered to finish down just 0.1% or 22 points. The S&P 500 was down as much as 0.2%, or 56 points, but came back to finish with a gain of 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite ended up 0.4% after falling as much as 1.3%.
Markets around the world were punched about by a surprising earnings disappointment from Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) and unexpected interest-rate cuts in India, New Zealand and Thailand. The rate cuts were due in part to slowing growth in all three countries and continued worries about the effects of the United States-China trade fight.
The uncertainty created by the rate cuts helped gold futures jump to a six-year high of $1519.60 an ounce, up $35.40 or 2.4%. Gold is up 4.3% this week and 5.7% so far in August. Its 18.6% gain for the year is better than the year-to-date gains for the Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. 
Gold-mining stocks were higher, and the SPDR® Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) exchange-traded fund added 1.5%. It's up 16.3% for the year, thanks to a 9.2% gain in the second quarter and a 5.9% gain so far in the third quarter. The gold-shares ETF invests directly in gold.
 
Disney missed earnings estimates and disclosed it was taking an earnings impairment from the box-office failure of ""Dark Phoenix,"" a film inherited from its $71 billion merger with the Fox studio business.
The shares were off 4.9% and subtracted about 47 points by themselves. Still, the shares are up 23% on the year.
The market's gyrations came as bond yields tumbled. The 10-Year Treasury Yield fell to 1.709% from Tuesday's 1.739% after falling to a 52-week low of 1.595%.
The rate drop helped the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) exchange-traded fund hit a 52-week high of $143.06. The ETF ended at $140.03, up slightly on the day. The ETF, however, is up 15.2% this year as rates have come down. 
The rate declines hurt financial stocks.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), down 2.2%, was the Dow's biggest loser after  Disney . SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB), parent of Silicon Valley Bank, fell 4.7%.   Charles Schwab   (NYSE:SCHW) dropped 4.6%.
Oil prices fell nearly 5% and are now off more than 20% since peaking in April. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell nearly 5% to $50.96 a barrel. Brent crude slumped 4.6% to $56.22.
The oil-price decline hit energy stocks, especially oil-services stocks like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and oil-and-exploration stocks like Apache (NYSE:APA).
The broader context of all this volatility was the Sino-American trade fight, which intensified when the United States said it would impose 10% tariffs on Chinese goods imported into the United States. The Chinese retaliated by letting its currency, the yuan, weaken to 7 to the dollar. 
Winners and Losers in the S&P 500

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 recovered from steep early losses to end slightly higher on Wednesday as investors snapped up oversold shares and bond yields rebounded from significant lows that raised fears about a recession.
Increasing worries over a global economic downturn and bets the Federal Reserve will have to pick up its pace of interest rate cuts pushed Treasury yields sharply lower early, with 10-year yields touching their lowest since October 2016.
Ten-year yields began to cut their earlier decline in afternoon trading after a soft auction.
That recovery in yields helped stocks, which have been tracking the movement in 10-year yields, said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
""The 10-year yield has come to represent all of the concerns about global growth at this very moment, so the stock market has latched onto it, like a kid to a lollipop. So when yields started to rise today, the stock market started to rise,"" he said.
""I wouldn't expect the market to shoot back to its high. We could be stuck in a range as this stuff sorts itself out.""
During the session, the premium on three-month Treasury bill rates over 10-year Treasury yields, a closely watched U.S. recession indicator, was at its most elevated levels since March 2007.
Financials were the biggest loser among S&P 500 sectors, down 1.2%, while the staples and materials indexes ended up more than 1% each.
Investors also were attracted to some bargains in shares after the recent selloff. The S&P 500 is down 4.7% since its July 26 record high close.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.45 points, or 0.09%, to 26,007.07, the S&P 500 gained 2.21 points, or 0.08%, to 2,883.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.56 points, or 0.38%, to 7,862.83.
Interest rates futures suggested traders are building bets the Fed will cut interest rates three more times by year-end.
Central banks in New Zealand, India and Thailand on Wednesday cut their lending rates amid growing fears that the U.S.-China trade war could aggravate a slowdown in the global economy.
Trade concerns re-emerged after President Donald Trump last week threatened to slap 10% levies on the rest of $300 billion of Chinese imports and called China a currency manipulator on Monday.
The energy sector was down 0.8% after oil prices slid.
On the plus side, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) shares climbed 7.5% after the drugstore chain raised its full-year profit forecast.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co dropped 4.9%, a day after its quarterly earnings missed analysts' forecast on higher investments in its streaming platform.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 31 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 212 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.05 billion shares, compared to the 7.1 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days."

1. Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) Earnings on Tap 
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) reports quarterly results before the opening bell Thursday. 
With shares of Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) down by more than a quarter for the year, well below the S&P 500's 15% gain, traders are keen to get a sense of how the new CEO Miguel Patricio plans to stem losses in market share and freshen up the food company's portfolio.
The company announced a dividend cut earlier this year after suffering $15.4 billion in asset writedowns related to its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands.
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is expected to report earnings of 75 cents per share on $6.59 billion in revenue compared with $1 a share on revenue of $6.69 billion a year ago.
Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), meanwhile, reports results after the closing bell. 
The video game company is expected to report earnings of 26 cents per share on revenue of $1.19 billion, down from 40 cents a share on revenue of $1.39 billion a year ago.
Bookings, time spent per user and monthly active users (MAUs) will also be closely watched, after the latter fell in the previous quarter. 
The company previously said it expected that bookings, one of the key metrics, to come in at $1.15 billion in the second quarter of 2019.
2. U.S. Jobless Claims Data Due
At 8:30 AM ET, the Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Aug. 4. 
Economists forecast initial jobless claims to remain unchanged at 215,000.
3. Yen Watch: Japan Q2 GDP
The yen will come into focus Thursday as Japan is set to release second-quarter economic growth numbers at 7:50 PM ET. 
Japan's second-quarter growth is expected to slow to a rate of 0.1% from 0.6% in the previous quarter. 
Export growth in the world's third-largest economy has been hurt by the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, forcing Japan's government to cut its growth forecasts for this year.
Growth estimates for this year were cut to 0.9% in price-adjusted real terms in the fiscal year ending in March 2020, down from a previous forecast of 1.3%. 
The yen has been propped up by fears that the U.S. and China are set for a protracted trade war after tensions escalated recently, following President Donald Trump's threat last week to hit China with more tariffs. "
612,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 05:02PM ET</span>","AIG profit rises 18% on strong underwriting, investment income","By Bharath ManjeshR and Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc (N:AIG) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, boosted by improved underwriting in general insurance business and higher investment income, sending its shares up 3% in extended trading. 
A strong performance in commercial and personal insurance in regions outside of North America helped the insurer post an underwriting profit of $147 million in its general insurance business compared with a loss of $89 million a year earlier.
The general insurance business reported its first underwriting profit last quarter since 2007, when it was hit by the financial crisis.
AIG, one of the largest U.S. insurers, earned $1.43 per share on an adjusted basis. That smashed the consensus forecast for $1.15 a share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
AIG shares were up 3% at $54.40 in after-hours trade.
AIG said its general insurance accident year combined ratio, excluding changes from losses incurred in past years, improved to 96.1 for the quarter, from 101 a year earlier.
A ratio below 100% means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.
Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault took the helm of AIG in 2017, promising to return the company to its glory days and make the company's general insurance business profitable again.
""General Insurance achieved its second consecutive quarter of underwriting profitability resulting from underwriting and expense discipline, and reinsurance actions, and remains on track to deliver an underwriting profit for the full year,"" Duperreault said in a statement.
AIG's acquisitions under Duperreault of reinsurer Validus and insurance program manager Glatfelter Insurance Group contributed to the better ratio, along with improvements to new business, renewal terms and use of reinsurance, the company said.
The insurer's net investment income jumped 19.4% to $3.7 billion, aided by higher returns from AIG's equity investments.
Net income attributable to the company's common stockholders rose to $1.10 billion, or $1.24 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $937 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. (https://reut.rs/2GVhQjZ)
Gross premiums in the general insurance business remained steady at $8.65 billion from the year-ago period.
Adjusted pretax income for AIG's life and retirement business was $1 billion, up 9% from $962 million in the prior year quarter.

Strong private equity returns, including income of $138 million from the initial public offering of a company in that portfolio, also helped fuel performance, AIG said.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 05:02PM ET</span>","Hedge fund investor Tarrant, who bet with Warren Buffett, dies","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Investor Jeffrey Tarrant, whose firm Protege Partners backed billionaire managers including William Ackman and Marc Lasry early in their careers and made a bet with Warren Buffett that hedge funds would outperform a passive index fund, has died at age 63.
Tarrant died on Aug. 5 at his home in Bridgehampton, New York, his firm said, giving the cause of death as brain cancer.
Over 17 years, Tarrant turned Protege Partners into a powerful backer of small hedge funds, often identifying and seeding portfolios before they became widely known and successful. Protege was the biggest early investor with John Paulson's Credit Opportunities Fund that bet against subprime mortgages and earned Paulson & Co. $15 billion in 2007. 
""Jeff had a gift for thinking ahead of industry trends and had an irrepressible entrepreneurial spirit,"" said Ted Seides who co-founded Protege with Tarrant in 2001.
""From the first database for hedge funds, early seeding of managers and shorting credit and subprime before the financial crisis, to his most recent passion for machine learning, Jeff held forward-thinking original ideas and a drive to bring them to fruition,"" added Seides, who hosts Capital Allocators podcast.
News of his death generated an outpouring on social media and within the hedge fund industry with many sharing anecdotes of how Tarrant helped them. 
Jeff ""was keen to develop and support talent, then step back to let them stand on their own feet. May he rest in peace,"" Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG) and former chief executive at Pacific Investment Management Co wrote on Twitter.
Two years ago Tarrant was diagnosed and treated for brain cancer. He stepped back from day-to-day management and moved into a newly created role of chairman, appointing Carol O'Donnell, who had been the firm's chief compliance officer, as chief executive officer. 
At the height of the financial crisis, Tarrant and Seides in 2008 made a $1 million bet with Warren Buffett, long considered one of the world's most successful investors, that their basket of chosen hedge funds would outperform a Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fund over 10 years. They lost. Still Tarrant told the Financial Times in 2017 that he felt he had won given all the access he had to Buffett over the decade. 
Tarrant graduated from Harvard Business School and co-managed the Sequoia Fund, a prominent portfolio, early in his career. He is survived by two daughters and two sisters.

Investing.com -   Monster Beverage   (NASDAQ:MNST) reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that missed analysts' expectations on Wednesday as higher costs weighed on margins. 

The firm reported earnings per share of $0.53 on revenue of $1.10 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated earnings per share of $0.56 on revenue of $1.13 billion. That compared to earnings per share of $0.51 on revenue of $1.02 billion in the same period a year earlier. The company had reported earnings per share of $0.50 on revenue of $945.99 million in the previous quarter.
The earnings miss comes as higher sales, led by the company's Reign Total Body Fuel energy drinks, were offset somewhat by higher costs that weighed on margins. 
""We are pleased to report record gross and net sales in the 2019 second quarter, driven by our Reign Total Body Fuel energy drinks, which we launched in the first quarter, as well as growth in our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks both domestically and internationally,"" Monster said in a statement. 
The company’s Monster energy drinks segment saw sales grow by 9.6% to $1.02 billion.
Operating expenses for the 2019 second quarter were $282.3 million, compared with $262.6 million in the 2018 second quarter.
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2019 second quarter was 59.9%, compared with 61.1% in the 2018 second quarter, with the company blaming the decline on ""geographical and product sales mix as well as increases in certain other input costs,"" which combined to offset increased sales prices of its products sold in the United States and Canada, as well as lower aluminum costs. 
The company said it would seek to launch its new Monster energy brand both domestically and abroad. 
“Later this year we are planning to introduce a number of new Monster Energy brand energy drinks in the United States and in various international markets,"" Monster said in a statement.
 
Monster Beverage shares lost 7.27% to trade at $56.00 in after-hours trade following the report.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields tumbled on Wednesday, with 30-year yields approaching record lows, on growing fears over a global economic downturn and bets the Federal Reserve would have to pick up its pace of interest rate cuts to counter recession risks.
A closely watched U.S. recession indicator, the premium on three-month Treasury bill rates over 10-year Treasury yields elevated to its highest level since March 2007.
Bond yields fell around the world with German yields hitting record lows in negative territory. That came in the wake of several Asian central banks lowering their key interest rates to address growth concerns stemming from the escalating trade war between China and United States.
Rate cuts in New Zealand, India and Thailand touched off a flood of buying of longer-dated bonds in Asia, which persisted into European and U.S. trading, analysts said.
""The delivery of rate cuts from central banks overseas added fuel to the rally,"" said Jonathan Cohn, interest rate strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York.

However, investor demand at an auction of $27 billion of 10-year government notes turned out softer than expected, selling at a yield of 1.670%, the lowest in three years.
The 10-year note sale is part of this week's $84 billion quarterly refunding which is expected to raise $26.7 billion in cash for new federal spending.
On the open market, the yields on benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) were 2.80 basis points lower at 1.711%. They had fallen earlier to 1.595%, the lowest since October 2016.
The prices on 30-year or long bonds at one point were up as much as 3 points, for a sixth day of gains.
Thirty-year yields (US30YT=RR) were down 3.60 basis points at 2.234% after it hit 2.123% earlier, which was not far from an all-time low of 2.089% set in July 2016, according to Refinitiv data.
U.S. yields backed away from their earlier lows on the soft 10-year auction and Wall Street recovering from its initial losses in late trading, curbing the safe-haven bids for bonds.
Interest rates futures suggested traders are building bets the Fed would cut interest rates three more times by year-end to avert a recession.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans signaled on Wednesday he was open to lowering interest rates to bolster inflation and to counter risks to economic growth from trade tensions.
""The bond market is saying the Fed is keeping policy rates too high,"" said John Briggs, head of strategy, Americas, at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
Investors' anxiety about a recession heightened the inversion between three-month bills and 10-year yields, which hit 39 basis points earlier on Wednesday, a level not seen since March 2007. It was last at 31 basis points, flat on the day.

A nine-day rally of about 8.5% for the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) ETF, or TLT, is the largest since the U.S. government debt was downgraded in August 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The winning streak is also the longest since 2006. What’s more, the surge has put the fund ahead of the biggest ETF that tracks U.S. stocks, which has tumbled around 5% over the same period.
Trade war angst and concern of a global slowdown have fueled a furious rally in bonds. Treasury 30-year yields are closing in on their lowest level ever, while those on 10-year notes are hovering around the least since 2016. In a sign that a recession could be in the offing, the difference between yields on 10-year and three-month notes has reached its most inverted level since 2007.
Treasury 30-Year Yield Closes In On All-Time Low as Risks Grow
“Investors are in a flight-to-safety mode,” said Dennis Debusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI. “The Chinese renminbi went to new lows this morning and Trump has tweeted they’ll keep on going on trade and eventually we’re going to win. As long as that is the rhetoric, it’s likely that Treasuries will outperform stocks.”
Inflows into TLT have outpaced SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s this year with the debt fund absorbing about $4.2 billion, the most since it started trading in 2002. The SPY (NYSE:SPY) fund, meanwhile, has seen outflows of more than $20 billion despite the S&P 500’s 14% gain this year. The stock benchmark fell 0.7% at 12:59 p.m. on Wednesday in New York.
Dovish central bank surprises underscored the growing concerns over the outlook for growth. New Zealand, Thailand and India cut interest rates earlier on Wednesday, emphasizing the global shift toward easier monetary policy.

621,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 04:02PM ET</span>",J.C. Penney Creditors Seek Talks for Potential Debt Swap,"(Bloomberg) -- J.C. Penney Co. creditors are pushing for discussions on a possible debt swap that would give the company’s new managers more time to turn the struggling retailer around.
Some of the department-store chain’s bondholders are seeking to rework a portion of its $4 billion of debt well ahead of their maturities in an effort to avoid the last-minute brinkmanship that contributed to the bankruptcies of Toys “R” Us Inc., Sears Holdings Corp. and Barneys New York Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter.
A possible deal could include swapping second-lien notes into higher-priority debt, giving creditors additional collateral, or compensating investors with higher coupon securities in exchange for extending maturities, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations. The fact that a handful of the J.C. Penney’s creditors are believed to also be sellers of near-term derivatives that protect against default is seen as a key driver in the push for formal talks, which haven’t started yet.
CDS Sellers
The retailer has been working with restructuring advisers from law firm Kirkland & Ellis and investment bank Lazard to explore opportunities to improve its balance sheet ahead of key maturity dates, the people said. A group of first-lien creditors is working with White & Case, while second-lien creditors are being advised by Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, the people said.
J.C. Penney, Lazard, White & Case and Stroock & Stroock & Lavan declined to comment. Kirkland & Ellis didn’t immediately return requests seeking comment. J.C. Penney is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Aug. 15, which likely limits its ability to engage in formal discussions at present.
Investors holding J.C. Penney’s secured debt believe the Plano, Texas-based company has more room to maneuver than Sears, Toys “R” Us and Barneys did because it has $1.75 billion of liquidity available, and no meaningful bond and term-loan maturities until 2023, the people said. The retailer has enough cash on hand to pay its upcoming debt obligations, they said.
The company also doesn’t face the same potential pressure from vendors that chains such as Toys “R” Us did given it has a significantly broader vendor base, one of the people said.
The 117-year-old department-store chain is under pressure to show that it can execute a turnaround under Chief Executive Officer Jill Soltau and avoid the same fate as many of it retail peers. Soltau was brought on in October to kick-start sales and improve margins, yet the company’s share price has tumbled and bonds have slid to depressed levels as investors remain dubious.
Hedge funds have been betting that J.C. Penney may default on its debt within the next year, sending the cost of protection in the CDS market soaring. It now costs $1.8 million to protect $10 million of debt against default for six months, roughly double what it did a month ago."

Fears about the clash between world's two biggest economies grew after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged last Thursday to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese-made goods.
Beijing responded by letting its currency weaken to its lowest level against the greenback in a decade on Monday. State media said local firms suspended buying U.S. agricultural products.
Then, the Treasury Department late on Monday labeled China a currency manipulator.
These developments touched off a dramatic sell-off in stocks and risky assets around the world and a safe-haven stampede into cash, yen, gold and some government bonds.
Total money fund assets grew by $57.54 billion to $3.301 trillion in the week ended Aug. 6, marking their highest level since November 2009, the Money Fund Report said on Wednesday.
The asset increase in the money fund industry was the biggest one so far this year,
Taxable money market fund assets increased by $57.21 billion to $3.165 trillion, while tax-free assets edged up by $330.70 million to $136.42 billion, according to the report, published by iMoneyNet.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. agency responsible for government contracts on Wednesday released an interim rule for a ban on federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei.
The ban is part of a broad U.S. push against Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world’s largest telecommunications network gear maker, which Washington accuses of espionage and stealing intellectual property.
Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services. It has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government over the restrictions in the defense policy bill.
The ban was included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed last year, and restricted the use of federal money to purchase telecommunications equipment and services and video surveillance equipment from ""covered"" telecommunications companies, citing national security concerns.
Huawei said in a statement that it ""continues to challenge the constitutionality of the ban in federal court.""
A spokesman for Hikvision (SZ:002415), another of the five banned companies, said it is committed to complying with laws and regulations in countries where it operates. Hikvision ""has made efforts to ensure the security of our products adhere to what is mandated by the U.S. government,"" the spokesman said.
Huawei and two of the other companies - ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) and Hytera (SZ:002583) - did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. The fifth company, Dahua (SZ:002236), could not immediately be reached for comment.
Government contractors have said they were confused about the scope of the ban and what it will mean for their businesses.
The first rule https:// implementing the ban was posted on a website for contractors called Acquisition.gov run by the General Services Administration, the government agency responsible for contracting. The interim rule is slated to take effect on Aug. 13. 
The government will accept comments on the rule for 60 days before it comes to a final version. It will allow agencies some ability to grant waivers through Aug. 13, 2021, for contractors where security is not at issue.
The broader ban, which will apply to contracts with any company that uses equipment from the companies, will take effect in August 2020.
In June, the White House Office of Management and Budget had asked Congress for two additional years to phase in the ban - a request that was quickly rebuffed by Republican national security hawks.

""The administration has a strong commitment to defending our nation from foreign adversaries, and will fully comply with Congress on the implementation of the prohibition of Chinese telecom and video surveillance equipment, including Huawei equipment,"" said Jacob Wood, a spokesman for the OMB.

Thyssenkrupp said in a statement that the departure was part of the ""strategic and structural"" realignment of the company. Kaufmann, executive board member responsible for legal and compliance as well as North America and Western Europe, had been a member of the management board since February 2014. He will leave on Sept. 30.
In May, Thyssenkrupp, under CEO Guido Kerkhoff, unveiled a major restructuring, including plans for a partial listing of the group's prized elevator business, while the group is also looking for partners for its remaining business divisions.
In a statement, supervisory Board Chairwoman Martina Merz praised Kaufmann for the commitment he had shown to the group.
""For Thyssenkrupp it is now important that the remaining executive board around Guido Kerkhoff continues to shape the company's change process with the same high level of commitment,"" she said.
""As the Supervisory Board, we support this process and stand by the executive board.""
The statement came after a meeting of the supervisory board at which Kerkhoff briefed the committee on the group's turnaround plans and the preparations of the initial public offering of the elevator division.

Shares in the conglomerate, which is due to report third-quarter results on Thursday, hit a fresh 16-year low earlier on Wednesday, amid growing concerns that demand for capital goods could suffer as a result of a cooling global economy.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 02:41PM ET</span>","New York Times forecasts weakness in digital ads, shares down 12%","By Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) - The  New York Times  Co (N:NYT) fell short of Wall Street estimates for revenue on Wednesday and warned of declines in digital advertising for the rest of the year, sending its shares down 12%.
The outlook overshadowed a better-than-expected second-quarter profit, helped by the 167-year old newspaper's efforts to make money from digital subscribers to counter a relentless decline in readership of its broadsheets.
Those efforts have paid off as company has added online subscribers at a fast pace in the past few years, also aided by the so-called ""Trump bump"" - the effect of U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks on the paper as well as its coverage of his administration.
The company, however, said it now sees digital advertising revenue to fall in the high-single digits percentage, attributing the drop to the timing of some large-scale, multi-month deals.
""We expect the second half of 2019 to be somewhat more challenging for digital advertising than the first half, with this year's revenue coming against our large gains in the third and fourth quarters of 2018,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson said in a statement.
Douglas Arthur, an analyst at Huber Research Partners, said although he had expected slower growth in digital ad revenue, the forecast was ""a disappointment"".
The Times added 197,000 digital-only subscribers in the quarter, pushing total subscriptions to 3.78 million. Its digital advertising revenue rose about 14%.
The paper has been aggressively rolling out offers to boost online subscriptions as more companies increasingly shift their ad dollars away from print to digital platforms such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB).
The Times said on Wednesday its $1 per week introductory offer weighed on average revenue per user (ARPU), which declined 9% from last year.
""(The offer) will continue to put downward pressure on ARPU throughout 2019,"" the company said on a conference call with analysts.
Total revenue rose 5% to $436.3 million, missing analysts' average estimate of $438.7 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

Excluding items, the company earned 17 cents per share, compared with the average estimate of 15 cents.

Earnings of 78 cents for the quarter, topped consensus estimates for earnings of 65 cents. But revenue of $369 million undershot estimates of $376.1 million.
The earnings beat comes as the company’s efforts to boost marketing steadied subscriber growth, which slumped earlier this year amid poor communication about the shift to a more of wellness company than a weight loss company.
Weight Watchers’ total members grew to 4.6 million for the quarter, up from 4.5 million members a year earlier. The steadier trend in subscriber growth drew praise from some analysts, though they warned that the company is not out of the woods yet. 
“Shares of WW continue to track well off highs and near historical lows, as investors fret over much-weaker-than-expected member growth earlier this year,” Oppenheimer said in a note to clients. “As we examine closely the better Q2 (Jun.) results, we by no means view WW as “out of the woods.”

629,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 02:04PM ET</span>",Is Pimco Right That Negative Yields Make Sense?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s longer retirements, stupid.
That, in a nutshell, is why negative bond yields might not be a nonsensical bubble ready to burst but actually natural, according to Joachim Fels, Pacific Investment Management Co.’s global economic adviser. More people in developed economies are living longer and need to save for decades of retirement, which, according to Fels, is causing a radical shift in how people prioritize immediate spending compared with future consumption. 
In a blog post this week on Pimco’s website, he laid out perhaps the most concise and straightforward case I’ve seen yet for what structural changes are behind this phenomenon of paying for the privilege of purchasing debt:
Once upon a time, economic theory maintained that people always value today’s consumption more than tomorrow’s consumption – and thus display positive time preference. People would therefore always demand compensation in the form of a positive interest rate in order to forgo current consumption and save for the future instead. People were viewed as impatient, and the more impatient people are, the higher the interest rate has to be to make them save.
This made sense in a world where people usually died before they retired and struggled to satisfy basic needs. However, it can be argued that in affluent societies where people can expect to live ever longer and thus spend a significant amount of their lifetimes in retirement, more and more people demonstrate negative time preference, meaning they value future consumption during their retirement more than today’s consumption. To transfer purchasing power to the future via saving today, they are thus willing to accept a negative interest rate and bring it about through their saving behavior.
Now, this notion of negative time preference alone isn’t enough to justify nominal yields falling below zero. Without question, the policies of global central banks play a leading role in redefining the lower bound for interest rates. The fact that the European Central Bank is willing to purchase an assortment of debt at any price is undoubtedly distorting the bond markets within the region. For instance, 10-year Spanish debt is yielding a record-low 0.13%, compared with more than 7% in 2012. Ten-year German bunds reached an all-time low of -0.6%. Even some European junk bonds, which by definition carry massive default risk, yield less than zero.
And, to be sure, it’s still too soon to say his final conclusion — that people are “willing to accept a negative interest rate” to transfer purchasing power to the future — will stand the test of time. It’s true that bonds with sub-zero yields have been around for years and that the pile has now grown to a staggering $15 trillion. But as I wrote recently, much of that debt was issued with a positive interest rate, and those buyers have seen sharp price appreciation as a result. The true test is still to come when countries and even companies try to sell securities that pay no interest at a price above face value, guaranteeing a loss if held to maturity.
Still, Fels’s point is the logical conclusion of taking the savings glut argument to its extreme. If trillions of dollars are out there seeking something as close to a riskless investment as possible to preserve investors’ wealth, then why shouldn’t the entire German yield curve yield nothing, or even less than nothing? The Federal Reserve’s gradual interest-rate increases over the past few years have kept Treasury yields firmly positive, but if Chair Jerome Powell and others capitulate and cut rates even deeper, it stands to reason that the benchmark 10-year U.S. rate will quickly approach zero as well.
The idea that negative yields are a natural byproduct of the times is a contentious topic, and one that many market observers simply will not accept. Bloomberg News’s Joe Weisenthal has been on the forefront of this argument on Twitter, using the term “yieldbugs” to describe those who argue sovereign interest rates (or rates on savings accounts) must be positive. In recent days, both Mark Grant at B. Riley FBR Inc. and my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Mark Gilbert have compared the situation in the bond markets to Lewis Carroll’s “Alice in Wonderland” and “Through the Looking-Glass.” The idea being that the impossible is becoming possible.
I, too, have argued that negative yields could be the death of the bond market as we know it. It’s possible to agree with that and also concede that Fels makes a strong point. There may come a time in the not-too-distant future when investors don’t expect to collect fixed interest payments from sovereign debt obligations, nor do they expect to earn anything from parking their cash in a savings account. That’s no longer a bond market in the traditional sense. If that sounds like something of a “wealth tax,” that’s because it effectively is. The two choices are to invest in risky but potentially lucrative endeavors or to keep that money safe but have it erode slowly through zero or negative interest rates.
Unsurprisingly, those accustomed to firmly positive returns on bonds are balking at those two paths. That’s probably in part why gold is having something of a renaissance of late, trading above $1,500 an ounce on Wednesday for the first time since early 2013. Just as slowing global growth and the escalating U.S.-China trade war push down bond yields, they also increase demand for other traditional havens.
Fels ends his post by stating that Pimco expects the Fed kicked off a major easing cycle last week and that if the central bank cuts the fed funds rate to near-zero and restarts quantitative easing, “negative yields on U.S. Treasuries could swiftly change from theory to reality.” Indeed, some eurodollar options trades on Wednesday targeted negative U.S. rates in 2022.
It certainly seems as if the world is in a race to the bottom in yields, with New Zealand being the latest example of a country slashing rates to try to boost inflation and weaken its currency. “It’s easily within the realms of possibility that we might have to use negative interest rates,” Reserve Bank Governor Adrian Orr said.
Fight ultra-low bond yields all you want. Other investors are locking in what they can get right now — like a near-record low 2.15% on 30-year Treasuries — before interest rates disappear entirely."
630,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 01:31PM ET</span>",U.S. banks limp away from hopes of interest margin expansion,"By David Henry and Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks are under pressure again, as policymakers around the globe have dashed any hopes that the industry might finally be able to earn more money on loans, after more than a decade of rock-bottom interest rates.
On Wednesday, central banks in New Zealand, India and Thailand slashed their benchmark rates to prop up their economies and stave off recession. Those moves followed the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision last week to cut its key rate for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.
The changes have stung major lenders, whose executives have long complained about the impact of low rates on lending income.
During second-quarter earnings calls last month, executives from several major U.S. lenders softened outlooks for net interest margins, some for the second time in 2019, according to the research firm Portales Partners. Meanwhile, Treasury yields fell to a near-record-low on Wednesday, with futures markets predicting the Fed will cut rates another three times by year-end.
""This is a dangerous situation,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer for Bleakley Advisory Group, a wealth management firm with $4.5 billion in assets under management. ""The global economy is slowing down dramatically, so the banks will get banged twice.""
Bank stocks led a decline in major U.S. indexes on Wednesday, with blue-chip lenders JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) all down 3% to 4%.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) was down 1.7%.
The S&P 500 Bank index was down 3.4% on Wednesday. The index has fallen four out of the last five days and has fallen about 9.7% since July 26.
It is a sharp reversal from the beginning of 2019, when Wall Street had been optimistic about the sector, predicting that banks would ride the coattails of a booming U.S. economy. But the escalating trade war between the United States and China, combined with softer economic data globally, have led economists to rein in estimates for growth as well as corporate earnings.
Analysts and investors contacted by Reuters on Wednesday issued a cautious tone about U.S. banks.
On one hand, narrowing interest margins will hurt, forcing banks to lean harder on fee-based income and potentially embark on another round of cost cuts. On the other hand, market volatility can be good for trading operations, and U.S. banks are in a better position than European rivals to withstand the economic stress.
""They are in a better shape to deal with lower rates,"" said David Hendler, founder of research firm Viola Risk Advisors.
He ticked off a list of businesses big banks can depend on besides traditional lending, including trading, prime services, underwriting and dealmaking.
But, for now, David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston, said he is avoiding the sector. Even though U.S. bank shares have become less expensive, he said, there is a good chance things will get worse before they get better.
""Banks are probably going to remain under pressure here,"" he said. ""They do best when the economy is reaccelerating, and we seem to be going in the opposite direction."""

633,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 01:14PM ET</span>",GM wins victory in ignition switch defect litigation,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) persuaded the U.S. federal judge who oversees nationwide litigation over defective ignition switches to narrow claims by owners who said their vehicles lost value because of the defect, which has been linked to 124 deaths.
In a decision late on Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman said owners in three ""bellwether"" states - California, Missouri and Texas - could not seek damages based on the difference in value between what they paid for their defective vehicles and what the vehicles were really worth.
He said the owners' failure to show the fair market value of their vehicles, despite testimony from an expert witness, created an ""absence of evidence on an essential element"" of their claims, making it impossible for a jury to assess damages.
The Manhattan-based judge also said that while damages could be measured by costs to repair defective vehicles, they could end up being zero if GM footed the bill.
GM spokesman David Caldwell said the Detroit-based automaker was pleased with the decision, saying it dismissed the owners' largest remaining claim.
Furman's 44-page decision is a defeat for owners who said they suffered economic losses from buying vehicles they thought were defect-free, only to see the ignition switch problem hurt GM's brand, reputation and ultimately resale values.
Because the decision ""changes the landscape in dramatic ways,"" Furman delayed indefinitely a proposed Jan. 13, 2020 trial on claims from bellwether states, and said ""it may well make sense for the parties to revisit the issue of settlement.""
Steve Berman, a lawyer for the owners, said he may ask Furman to reconsider the decision, and was confident he could address the judge's concerns in cases from other states.
""There has to be a damage remedy for consumers who unwittingly drove cars with serious safety issues,"" Berman said in an email. ""The car maker doesn't get a free pass when it's caught lying years later and then fixes the cars.""
GM has recalled more than 2.6 million vehicles since 2014 over ignition switches that could cause engines to stall and prevent airbags from deploying.
The automaker has paid more than $2.6 billion in penalties and settlements, including $900 million to settle a U.S. Department of Justice criminal case.
That case was dismissed last September after GM honored its obligations under a three-year deferred prosecution agreement.
The nationwide litigation before Furman also covered well over 3,000 personal injury and wrongful death claims. A large majority have been resolved or dismissed.

The case is In re: General Motors LLC Ignition Switch Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 14-md-02543.

639,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 12:24PM ET</span>",Tesla scrutinized by U.S. agency over Model 3 safety claims: Bloomberg,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) received a cease-and-desist letter last year from U.S. regulators for making ""misleading statements"" over safety ratings of its Model 3 sedans as well as two subpoenas related to crashes involving its cars, according to documents seen by Reuters.
An Oct. 17, 2018, letter shows the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) accused Tesla of failing to conform to the agency's guidelines when it claimed the Model 3 had the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle ever tested by NHTSA.
Tesla, founded and run by Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk, on Wednesday stood by its safety claims, saying it used NHTSA's own data to back them up. The documents also showed that the carmaker filed a confidential response in August 2018 to one of the subpoenas from that April.
NHTSA said it was referring Tesla's safety claims about the Model 3 to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate whether the automaker's statements constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices.
An FTC spokesman declined to comment, saying ""investigations are non-public, and we don't comment on ... the existence of an investigation.""
Asked about the documents, a Tesla spokesman on Wednesday pointed to statements made in the company's Oct. 31, 2018, letter to NHTSA in which it maintained that the Model 3 had the lowest risk of occupant injury of any vehicle in U.S. government tests. 
In that letter, the company's deputy general counsel, Al Prescott, said: ""Tesla's statement is neither untrue nor misleading. ... We had hoped NHTSA would welcome such an achievement because it was presented in an objective manner using the agency's own data.""
NHTSA did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment by phone and email. In its Oct. 17 letter to Musk, it said Tesla's safety claim was ""inappropriate"" and ""inconsistent"" with the agency's guidelines. 
""The guidelines warn against comparison statements like these because such statements mislead consumers about the relative safety of different vehicle models,"" NHTSA chief counsel Jonathan Morrison said in the letter. 
""To say Tesla's midsize sedan has a lower probability of injury than say a larger SUV could be interpreted as misunderstanding safety data, an intention to mislead the public, or both,"" he added.
The Model 3 had received the top rating on the agency's 5-Star Safety Ratings Program that uses three crash tests and a rollover resistance assessment.
The U.S. Department of Transportation released the documents after legal transparency group PlainSite obtained them under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
Tesla has still not changed the blog post that says its cars ""are engineered to be the safest cars in the world.""
It also says Tesla cars ""have achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle ever tested by the U.S. government's New Car Assessment Program.""
Safety groups have criticized Tesla for being unclear about the need for ""hands-on"" driving with its autonomous driving feature.

The carmaker's use of the term ""full self-driving"" garners criticism, as the option is not yet ""Level 4,"" or fully autonomous by industry standards, in which the car can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 11:44AM ET</span>",Unstoppable: German Bund yield tumbles to new record lows,"By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - German long-dated bond yields tumbled to new record lows deep in negative territory on Wednesday as a large rate cut from New Zealand and weak German data gave further impetus to a relentless rally in bond markets.
While some calm has returned to world markets after a ratcheting-up in U.S.-China trade tensions over the past week, fixed income markets continue to benefit from the expectation that a bitter trade war raises global recession risks and strengthens the case for monetary policy easing. 
New Zealand's central bank stunned markets by cutting its official cash rate by a bigger-than-anticipated 50 basis points, and looked set to keep policy lower for longer in the face of growing economic risks.
""While New Zealand rarely registers on the radar for European bond markets, the big rate cut at the moment adds to the feeling that central banks need to get ahead of the curve in acting aggressively and not letting their currencies rise,"" said Christoph Rieger, head of rates at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
Across the bloc, 30-year bonds outperformed with yields falling 10-13 bps (PT30YT=RR) (ES30YT=RR), with German ultra-long-dated yields sliding to a record low of -0.147% (DE30YT=RR). Spanish 30-year bond yields fell below 1% for the first time to trade at 0.998% .
Ten-year bond yields across the euro area fell as many as 10 basis points with Spain's 10-year debt slipping to a new all-time low of 0.124%. The Dutch 10-year bond yield hit a new all-time low at -0.504%, while Ireland's 10-year bonds spent the whole session trading with a yield below zero for the first time (IE10YT=RR), (NL10YT=RR).
(GRAPHIC - Germany's bond yield curve: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YvAiL0)
Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield slid to a record low of -0.61% (DE10YT=RR), taking its falls so far this year to a hefty 82 bps and putting it on track for its biggest one-day tumble since ECB President Mario Draghi's Sintra speech in June this year. HSBC said on Tuesday the German Bund yield could tumble to -0.8% by year-end.
It has fallen for nine straight sessions, its longest streak of falls since November 2015, according to Refinitiv data.
Data showed German industrial output fell more than expected in June, a further sign that Europe's biggest economy contracted in the second quarter as exporters got caught in trade disputes.
""All in all, we would characterize today's industrial production report as devastating, with no silver lining,"" said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany.
Falling German long-dated bond yields pushed the gap over shorter-dated peers to just 25 bps (DE2YT=RR) (DE10YT=RR) - its tightest since 2008.
(GRAPHIC - German 2-10 yield gap tighest since 2008: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YvTZSW)
""We are seeing some pretty strong bullish flattening across curves,"" said Rabobank fixed income strategist Matt Cairns.
""If you are paying for the privilege of holding long-dated German debt, that is indicative of a market that doesn't expect central banks to pull back on easy policy anytime soon."" 
Last week's vow by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, sharply escalating a bruising trade war, pushed German 30-year bond yields and the whole curve below 0% for the first time.

Germany meanwhile sold 2.646 billion euros in a top-up of its 0.00 percent, 5-year Bobl notes in a weak auction that led to a slight underperformance of five-year bonds.

""Investors are very much concerned about the trade war and its expansion and that's certainly being manifested in the price of gold.""
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his criticism of the Federal Reserve for not doing enough to stimulate the economy, after three other countries' central banks cut rates Wednesday.
New Zealand’s central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark policy rate to an all-time low, while the central banks of India and Thailand also cut rates due to slowing economic growth. 
Trump tweeted that the Fed needs to “cut rates bigger and faster,” and that ""our problem"" was not China, but the U.S. central bank.

The results come weeks after other established restaurant chains such as McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG) and  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) reported solid growth, driven by new menu additions and expanded delivery services.
Wendy's has also revamped its menus, launching the ""$5 Biggie Bag combo"", expanding its ""Made to Crave"" menu and adding a parmesan caesar chicken salad to its offering.
""We are pleased with Wendy's performance given McDonald's best U.S. comparable performance since 4Q15,"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said.
Wendy's has also invested in remodeling its restaurants and adding kiosks, while ramping up delivery through a partnership with DoorDash.
More than 80% of the burger chain's U.S. restaurants were covered by the DoorDash service at the end of second quarter, the company said.
These efforts lifted North America same-stores sales growth 1.4% in the quarter, slightly above analysts' average estimate of 1.36%.
Chief Executive Officer Todd Penegor on a post-earnings call said he was also looking at including plant-based proteins in the company's menu.
Meat alternatives from companies such as  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) and its competitor Impossible Foods have seen booming demand from consumers and restaurants.
Excluding certain items, Wendy's posted adjusted profit of 18 cents per share in the quarter, beating estimates by 1 cent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company also reaffirmed its full-year adjusted profit forecast of about 3.5% to 7% growth, which Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said was ""likely to be viewed positively.""
But Wendy's total revenue of $435.3 million came in below estimates of $439.9 million.

648,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 10:16AM ET</span>",RBI moves unlikely to ease pain for India's struggling shadow banks,"By Nupur Anand and Swati Bhat
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's central bank outlined two measures on Wednesday aimed at easing liquidity pressures on crisis-hit shadow banks, but industry insiders say the moves, while positive, are unlikely to lead to any substantive improvements in the troubled sector.
The Reserve Bank of India, which also cut its benchmark policy rate by 35 basis points on Wednesday, said it would allow banks to increase their exposure to a single non-banking finance company (NBFC). The move was aimed at boosting credit to cash-strapped NBFCs, or shadow banks.
The RBI also allowed banks to classify loans to NBFCs for key areas such as agriculture, housing and small and medium businesses - up to certain limits - as priority sector lending, in a bid to keep credit flowing to the parts of the economy where most Indians work.
NBFC's have been battling a credit crunch since IL&FS, or Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services, collapsed in late 2018 amid fraud allegations. The fall of IL&FS, a behemoth in the space, pushed up borrowing costs for rivals and has sharply impacted consumer spending and stung sectors such as real estate and autos that are big drivers of consumer demand.
Senior executives from at least three NBFCs, however, said the moves announced by the RBI on Wednesday, coupled with other recent changes, were unlikely to ease the pressure substantially.
""Banks and financial institutions have become so risk-averse that they just aren't keen on increasing their exposure to NBFCs right now, so even though the measures are positive the scenario is unlikely to change until the economic environment improves,"" said the finance head of one NBFC, who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the media.
INCREMENTAL STEPS
Wednesday's moves were the latest in a series of measures rolled out by the government and the RBI over the last few months to ease liquidity for NBFCs, but so far the initiatives have not yielded significant benefits.
""Today's steps are marginally better from the ones taken earlier, but even these seem to be merely incremental in nature considering the current market,"" said the head of another small NBFC, who also asked not to be named.
Even though the RBI has been focused primarily on improving liquidity, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Wednesday that the regulator was also keen to ensure that there were no collapses of any large, systemically important NBFCs.
Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd , one of the largest housing finance companies in India, which owes nearly 1 trillion rupees ($14 billion) to its creditors, is currently scrambling to get its lenders to sign-off on a restructuring plan that will place a moratorium on repayments, even as it seeks funds from banks to start retail lending.
At a press briefing after the RBI policy meeting, Das acknowledged that any benefit from the new directives was contingent on banks' willingness to increase their lending to the shadow sector.
""It's for banks to make their own risk assessment and take the call,"" he said.
Analysts said the tweak in the priority sector lending rules may work in favor of smaller, retail-focused NBFCs that have lately struggled to raise funding, but may not help bigger shadow banks that have been the hardest hit.
""Larger corporate-focused shadow banks that are struggling more will see only incremental benefits,"" said A.M. Karthik, financial sector head at rating agency ICRA."

The regulatory questions are over whether the joint venture will be able to obtain the required approvals for building a joint factory, Great Wall said in a stock market filing made in response to media reports that the alliance was in trouble.
German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported on August 4 that the tie-up could fail, citing sources familiar with the matter. [https:// Since February 2018 BMW and Great Wall have worked on plans to build a low-cost electric vehicle on a joint platform which BMW would use for the Mini brand and Great Wall would use for its own brand.  BMW and Great Wall have not yet received permission to build a new plant in Changsu, China and Chinese State Planning authorities last year tightened regulations on adding manufacturing capacity unless factory utilization rates improve. Hit by the U.S.-China trade war, China's vehicle sales have fallen for 12 months in a row, including in June. Industry officials and analysts now expect car demand to slide some 5% this year, its first decline since the 1990s. Great Wall said in its statement on Wednesday: ""At present, the project is proceeding as planned, and the two parties are communicating on the details of the cooperation and preparing for the project to seek approval from the relevant authorities."" BMW also said the joint venture was going very well in all work streams and significant progress was being made in all business areas.  Automakers and suppliers are scrambling to meet tough new Chinese quotas for less polluting cars. Those rules call for electric and rechargeable hybrid vehicles to account for a fifth of total sales by 2025. Great Wall is China's top sport utility vehicle and pick-up truck maker. It also builds Ora, an affordable battery electric vehicle brand in Baoding, the city where it is based. The joint venture aims to build a plant in Zhangjiagang city with the capacity for making 160,000 gasoline vehicles for export and another 160,000 new energy vehicles, documents on the city's website show. It will also have a research center and car parts manufacturing facilities. A separate local government document shows the total investment of the project is forecast at 20.2 billion yuan ($2.87 billion). 
BMW has a separate manufacturing alliance with BMW Brilliance Automotive in Shenyang.

Dovish actions by central banks from New Zealand to India on Wednesday added fuel to the rally in bonds, dragging the yield on 30-year U.S. debt down by as much as 9 basis points to 2.14%. That’s close to the all-time low of 2.0882% reached in July 2016.
The U.S. curve flattened, signaling increased alarm among investors about the prospects for the economy. In Germany, the gap between 2-year and 30-year yields was compressed to levels unseen since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
“This is all about the race to the bottom by central banks,” said London-based Peter McCallum, a fixed-income strategist at Mizuho International Plc. The Federal Reserve “is going to become more dovish, and that’s why long-end Treasuries is being supported.”
The moves come ahead of a U.S. auction of 10-year debt Wednesday that will test investors’ appetite for yields at these lower levels, while the Treasury Department is slated to sell 30-year securities on Thursday.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield slipped as much as 8 basis points to 1.62%, the least since 2016, while fed funds futures showed traders adding to bets on U.S. central bank easing. The market is pricing around a percentage point of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts over the next year, with the November contract pricing in around half a point of easing from current levels.

Michael Kors, which accounts for the bulk of the company's sales, still depends heavily on selling through department stores, where sales are struggling as more shoppers choose to buy online.
The brand is also rolling back discounts and inventories at its own stores as it looks to drive more full-price sales.
While the move to sell more at full price drove a better-than-expected quarterly profit, it took a toll on Kors' store traffic, with same-store sales falling in the low single digits in the reported quarter.
Demand for high-end handbags, Kors' signature product, has also slowed in the United States in recent months as more shoppers choose to spend their money on retro fanny packs and fashion backpacks, according to analysts at research firm Jane Hali & Associates.
Michael Kors revenue decreased 4.8% to $981 million and sales at Jimmy Choo, Capri's stiletto brand which is also foraying into handbags, fell 8.7% to $158 million in the reported quarter.
However, Italian luxury fashion brand Versace, which Capri bought last year for about $2 billion to help it tap into Europe's affluent shoppers, was a bright spot for the company with revenue of $207 million beating 4 analysts' average estimate of $202.37 million.
Net income attributable to the company fell to $45 million from $186 million, due to a $97 million impairment charge.
Excluding items, the company earned 95 cents per share, beating analysts expectation of 90 cents.
Total revenue rose nearly 12% to $1.35 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $1.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
For the full year, Capri expects revenue of $5.8 billion, down from its earlier forecast of $6 billion.
The company, however, backed its full-year earnings forecast of $4.95 per share, which now includes the impact of the recently announced U.S. tariffs on products produced in China.
The unchanged earnings guidance may provide some short-term relief in Capri's stock, Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman said, adding that there are still underlying issues in the continued deterioration at Michael Kors.
Capri's shares, which have fallen nearly 17% this year, rose 4.5% in light premarket trading."

Elliott, which owns about 4.9% in QEP, in January offered to buy the company for $2.07 billion, saying QEP remained undervalued despite its focus on the lucrative Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale oilfield.
QEP said it will create a five-person operations committee, chaired by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cutt, that will include two current independent directors and two new board members as part of the agreement with Elliott.
Elliott agreed to customary standstill, voting and other provisions, QEP said.
QEP, which also reported an adjusted loss, also reinstated its quarterly dividend of 2 cents per share and cut its 2019 spending by about $50 million at its midpoint.
Investors in the energy sector have been pushing energy companies to cut down on drilling and instead boost shareholder returns. 
The company also raised its 2019 production forecast to 29.9 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) to 31 million boe, from 28.5 million boe and 30.3 million boe expected earlier.
Production fell 47% to 7.5 million boe in the second quarter as the company sold assets in Haynesville and Uinta Basin.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could extend a 30-month grace period granted to Wall Street firms to comply with European Union investment rules to unbundle research and other services, commissioner Hester Peirce said on Wednesday.
The SEC had given U.S. brokers until the middle of next year to comply with MiFID II, due to a quirk in the U.S. federal securities law that bars U.S. firms from complying with the EU rules, which took effect in January 2018.
The European rules aim to eliminate conflicts of interest by giving investors greater transparency over how much they pay banks for discrete services but have caused a slew of cross-border compliance issues for U.S. firms.
""MiFID II has been quite a big issue. We did give temporary relief and I think what we're going to end up doing is probably extending that relief because we're trying to come up with a permanent solution, but it's not that easy,"" Peirce told members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan.
She added that a solution that might work for some firms might not actually work well for other firms.

""Maybe the Europeans could change their approach, that's a possibility. We do a lot of communication with our foreign regulatory counterparts.""

663,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 08:26AM ET</span>",Global Bond Market Sounds Shrillest Alarm Yet Over the Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- The global bond market is sounding the alarm that things won’t be able to carry on much longer before a recession strikes.
Germany’s yield curve is now at its flattest since the financial crisis -- and yields across the world are slumping to fresh lows -- in a cacophony of signs that investors are growing increasingly pessimistic about the outlook for the world economy. Central banks from New Zealand to India have responded by surprising markets with their efforts to boost stimulus.
“This is all setting up for something very disruptive,” said Marc Ostwald, a global strategist at ADM Investor Services. “What exactly is difficult to enumerate, but the flattening will continue as long as people believe that bunds are a safe haven.”
In recent weeks, investors have faced off against a barrage of record-low yields as they have flocked to the remaining corners of the market where they can still eek out a positive return. Germany’s entire curve is already fully below 0%, while even the 10-year bonds of some of the riskiest nations in the euro area -- such as Spain and Portugal -- are getting precariously close to negative territory.
Investors are therefore seeking refuge in longer-dated bonds, betting that the European Central Bank will need to embark on quantitative easing again to counter a weakening economy. Shorter-dated bonds -- those more sensitive to interest-rate cuts -- have moved less, given the deposit rate is already deeply negative at -0.40%.
Trade Tensions
Globally too, the repercussions of the U.S.-China trade war are being felt. Ten-year Treasury yields are at the lowest level since 2016, with the premium over two-year bonds next to nothing -- a sign that an economic recession may be just months away.
Fears have grown this week that the dispute between U.S. and China over trade is spilling into a global currency war after the People’s Bank of China move to weaken the yuan to levels unseen since 2008. There are signs that the Swiss National Bank may be intervening to weaken the franc, while India, New Zealand and Thailand all cut interest rates.
The Federal Reserve may have to embark on an easing package of its own, according to Nomura Asset Management money manager Richard Hodges.
“The Fed will cut rates aggressively over next 12 months,” Hodges said. “I see little good news or evidence the US economy will improve and more suggesting it will fall further. How anyone can give an optimistic view on global economies is beyond me.”
Not Done
German 30-year bond yields dropped as much as 10 basis points to -0.14%, narrowing the spread over those on two-year bonds to 71 basis points, the lowest level since 2008. The difference between two- and 10-year Treasuries is just 9 basis points.The flattening is unlikely to be finished just yet given the ECB may have to come up with alternative easing measures to counter stalling inflation, such as yield-curve control, according to Danske Bank AS. That refers to a practice by the Bank of Japan, which limits the range yields can move.
“This is all supportive for flatteners,” said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske. The trend will continue “unless they start some significant fiscal expansion in Germany, but what is the chance of that?”"

Subway said it would use the plant-based meatballs in its trademark 'Meatball Marinara sub' at the restaurants for a limited period.
Shares of Beyond Meat, which sells its plant-based burgers and sausages at restaurants and in supermarkets, rose 4% in premarket trading. They have soared 545% since their IPO in May.
Plant-based meat alternatives have seen booming interest from consumers and restaurants, supporting startups like Beyond Meat and its competitor Impossible Foods, and even sparking interest from veteran meat companies such as  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and Perdue Foods. 

Beyond Meat's products, including faux meat patties and beef crumbles, are used in Del Taco Restaurant Inc's (O:TACO) tacos and Carl's Jr's burgers and most recently, in chains such as Dunkin' and Canada's Tim Hortons. Blue Apron (O:APRN) last month said it would also add Beyond Meat's plant-based burgers to its meal-kits.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were $5.58 billion for the six months ended June 30 against $8.18 billion a year earlier.
The company's shares were trading nearly 2% lower by 1139 GMT, recovering slightly from losses that took them to their weakest since October 2016. 
Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg blamed ""a challenging economic backdrop for our commodity mix"" and setbacks during the ramp-up of operations in Africa.
Glencore stands apart from other diversified miners because of its high-profile trading division and an appetite for risk that in the past has appealed to investors.
It initially rebounded strongly from the commodity crash of 2015-16.
But cobalt, which was meant to be part of Glencore's strategic advantage as the world switches to electrification, has become a liability.
Supplies are concentrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Glencore is in a dispute with the government over a mining law. It is also subject to a U.S. Department of Justice investigation.
Explaining the rationale for placing the Mutanda copper and cobalt mine in the DRC on ""care and maintenance"" from the end of this year for an expected two years, Glasenberg said there was ""a mix"" of reasons, including DRC's revised mining code, which Glencore is challenging.
Above all, Glasenburg said the mine's economic viability had deteriorated because of low cobalt prices, poor access, increased costs and higher taxes.
Glencore in the past has restricted supplies to boost prices. It spurred a 10% price rally in zinc  after the company in October 2015 announced plans to cut zinc production by 500,000 tonnes, or 4 percent of the global market.
BURST BUBBLE
Hit by oversupply, cobalt prices have shrunk from above $60,000 per tonne in late 2018 to around $25,000. 
Copper prices  are also subdued, as trade tensions between the United States and China weigh on commodity markets.
Glencore said last week it had begun an overhaul of its underperforming Africa business after the company faced a $350 million hit because of lower cobalt prices.
The company also said on Wednesday its net debt to EBITDA ratio had crept above its target to 1.24 times.
The ratio is an important measure of available cash for the capital-intensive mining industry. Glencore said the level was ""still healthy"" but sought to move towards a ratio of one over the next six to 12 months.
Analysts had expected Glencore to report core earnings of $5.94 billion in the first half, according to a company-compiled consensus of 12 estimates.
In a note,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said the ""silver lining"" was that the closure of Mutanda would boost the cobalt market. The mine produced around 13,000 tonnes of cobalt in the first half and accounts for 15% of global supplies, Credit Suisse estimated.
It reiterated its outperform rating, saying: ""Despite the likelihood of further negative newsflow, our outperform rating is underpinned by Glencore's highly attractive valuation versus its peers."" 
Shares of other diversified miners have risen this year, while Glencore's share price has lost around a fifth.
Frances Hudson, an investment director at Aberdeen Standard, one of Glencore's top 20 shareholders, said ""an approach that restricts the supply of cobalt to the market looks rational"".

So far, the beneficiaries of the anticipated shut-in have been China-listed cobalt producers, whose shares have rallied strongly.

Bayer, which acquired the weedkiller as part of its purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) last year, was initially scheduled to face its first trial outside California in St. Louis, Missouri, on Aug. 19, brought by Illinois resident Sharlean Gordon, who blames her non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on using Roundup at home.
""We anticipate that this court case will be postponed but we have not received any written decision,"" a Bayer spokesman said. He would not comment on how Bayer was informed of the delay or on the reason for it.
German weekly Wirtschaftswoche earlier reported the likely delay.
Bayer has seen its market value slashed by about 30 billion euros since August last year, when a California jury in the first such lawsuit found that Monsanto should have warned of the alleged cancer risks. 
The company, which says regulators and extensive research have found glyphosate to be safe, is banking on U.S. appeals courts to reverse or tone down the first three court rulings that have so far awarded tens of millions of dollars to each plaintiff.
Bayer has previously flagged two more St. Louis cases due to start in September and October, respectively, but the spokesman on Wednesday said he could not comment on their timing.

669,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 07:30AM ET</span>",Germany’s Yield Curve Flashes Stark Warning on Global Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s yield curve is flashing a red alert over the European economy, and it may not be done yet.
The yield gap between two- and 30-year German debt is the lowest since the financial crisis, a sign that investors are pessimistic about the outlook for euro-area economies.
The narrowing has been led by increased demand for longer-dated notes amid global trade tensions that has forced investors to chase diminishing returns. The entire curve in Europe’s biggest economy is already fully below 0%.
“This is all setting up for something very disruptive,” said Marc Ostwald, a global strategist at ADM Investor Services. “What exactly is difficult to enumerate, but the flattening will continue as long as people believe that bunds are a safe haven.”
German 30-year bond yields dropped eight basis points to -0.11%, narrowing the spread over those on two-year bonds to 71 basis points, the lowest level since 2008. The comparable gauge in the U.S. is at 63 basis points.
Investors are seeking refuge in longer-dated bonds, betting that the European Central Bank will need to embark on quantitative easing again to counter a weakening economy. Shorter-dated bonds -- those more sensitive to interest-rate cuts -- have moved less, given the deposit rate is already deeply negative at -0.40%.
The flattening is unlikely to be finished just yet given the ECB may have to come up with alternative easing measures to counter stalling inflation, such as yield-curve control, according to Danske Bank AS. That refers to a practice by the Bank of Japan, which limits the range yields can move.
“This is all supportive for flatteners,” said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske. The trend will continue “unless they start some significant fiscal expansion in Germany, but what is the chance of that?”"

673,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 06:31AM ET</span>",Tesla considers raising prices in China from September: sources,"By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is considering lifting its prices in China from September amid yuan-related uncertainty, two people familiar with the matter said.
The people declined to be named as the plan has not been made public. They did not offer detail on the price change.
China allowed the yuan to weaken past the 7-per-dollar level on Monday for the first time in more than a decade, after which the U.S. government labeled China a currency manipulator, raising the stakes in the trade dispute between the two countries.
China firmly opposes the currency manipulator label saying it has not used and will not use the yuan to cope with the U.S. trade frictions. 
The sharp drop in the yuan comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump stunned financial markets by vowing to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, abruptly breaking a brief ceasefire in a trade war that has disrupted global supply chains and slowed growth.
Tesla currently imports all the cars it sells in China, but it is in the process of building a factory in Shanghai that will manufacture Model 3 cars in the initial phase and help it minimize the impact of the trade war and tariffs. 
If enacted, this would be the first case of a planned price adjustment by an importer since the yuan fell this week and points to the growing pressure that importers are facing. 
Tesla broke ground on the Shanghai factory in January and its Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said the firm aims to finish initial construction this summer and start production of the Model 3 toward the end of the year. 
Deliveries of all models in the second quarter this year rose 51% from the first quarter to 95,200 vehicles, including 77,550 Model 3s, 17,650 Model S and X.
Last month, Tesla globally dropped the standard-range variants of its Model X and Model S from its product lineup and adjusted prices across its range.
In China, the world's largest electric vehicle market, the trade frictions between China and the U.S. has caused Tesla to adjust its multiple times over the past year because of the tariff changes.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

675,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 06:02AM ET</span>",British energy bills to fall by 75 pounds a year: regulator,"By Nina Chestney and Noor Zainab Hussain
LONDON (Reuters) - Energy bills are set to fall for millions of households in Britain this winter after the country's energy regulator told suppliers to reduce bills by 6% from Oct. 1, following a drop in wholesale gas and power prices this year.
Britain's big six energy suppliers are Centrica's British Gas, SSE (LON:SSE), Iberdrola's Scottish Power, Innogy's npower, E.ON and EDF's EDF (PA:EDF) Energy.
The regulator, Ofgem, said the price cap for average annual consumption will fall by 75 pounds ($91.21) to 1,179 pounds from Oct. 1. In April the cap was raised by more than 10% to 1,254 pounds.
""Wholesale energy prices have significantly fallen between February and June 2019. A combination of low demand during the winter, strong gas supply and relatively healthy storage levels have pushed down wholesale prices,"" Ofgem said https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/energy-caps-fall-winter-due-lower-wholesale-costs in a statement.
Wholesale UK gas and power prices have steadily lost up to half their value since last September.
Ofgem was tasked with taking action by parliament last year after lawmakers said customers were being overcharged for electricity and gas.
The price cap applies to the so-called standard variable tariff (SVT), the most popular type of rate offered by the big six, as well as to other default deals, and is intended to be a temporary measure lasting until 2023 at the latest.
Around 11 million customers are on SVTs.
Last month, the Competition and Markets Authority made changes to a pre-payment meter cap which will lower costs by 25 pounds a year for another 4 million customers.
Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem, told journalists that the difference between SVTs and other tariffs will likely fall in the coming months but there are still cheaper tariffs available which people can choose to switch to.
""I do not think the cap is conservative. If you look at the pressure it has put on energy supply firms to make efficiency cuts and up their game....then it is not a 'soft-touch' price cap,"" he said.
(GRAPHIC - Duel fuel energy bills in Britain: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Yr4BCq)
REVIEW
The shares of UK-listed  Centrica  (LON:CNA) and SSE were little changed. German energy group E.ON posted a 75% drop in operating profit on Wednesday at its retail unit, as the UK price cap in squeezed margins.
""The market in Great Britain is currently particularly challenging,"" E.ON chief financial officer Marc Spieker said.
Months of weak gas prices have hurt the bottom line of some gas suppliers such as Centrica, which reported a near 50% drop in adjusted operating profit for the first half of 2019, sending its shares to a 21-year low.
Ofgem reviews the default tariff cap each April and October and can adjust it according to changing costs such as wholesale energy prices.
It is calculated using a formula that includes wholesale gas prices, energy suppliers network costs and costs of government policies, such as renewable power subsidies.
Ofgem said the wholesale energy cost part of the cap fell by 75 pounds to 446 pounds and other costs, such as VAT and supplier profits, fell slightly.
""These reductions offset cost increases totaling 7 pounds of other elements such as operating costs, network charges and environmental schemes, resulting in an overall reduction of £75 in the level of the default tariff cap,"" Ofgem added.
Ofgem has estimated that the default tariff cap would have reduced the price of average SVTs from the six largest suppliers by 75-100 pounds per year since April 2015 had it been in place since then.
""(This) shows these suppliers have consistently charged more than the indicative level of the default tariff cap, which reflects the estimated costs of an efficient supplier,"" it said.

676,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 05:46AM ET</span>","Europe’s Banks Warn of Lower Rates as Commerzbank, UniCredit Hit","(Bloomberg) -- Top European banks warned of weaker earnings as escalating trade tensions take a toll on their clients and the prospect of lower interest rates erodes their main source of income.
 Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) said its goal of lifting profit this year is looking increasingly “ambitious” after revenue fell for a fourth quarter and it set aside more money for soured loans. UniCredit SpA slashed its full year revenue target by 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), citing expectations that interest rates will stay lower for longer. Dutch lender ABN Amro added to the gloom, saying its margins are being hit.
Their warnings underscore how global trade tensions are rippling through the euro-zone’s export-driven economy, the world’s third largest. Many firms have refocused their businesses on lending to domestic clients in expectation that borrowing costs will rise after half a decade of negative rates in the region. With interest rates now set to go lower, any profits they make from increased lending are being squeezed.
Commerzbank Chief Executive Officer Martin Zielke has bet the future of the bank on adding new clients and boosting lending to companies and individuals. But the prospect of sustained low rates is making it increasingly difficult to earn enough money to finance investments in technology. The CEO earlier this year abandoned most of the bank’s 2020 financial targets and has signaled he remains open to mergers after talks with  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) collapsed.
“Despite all the successes we have made, challenges continue to increase for the industry and for us,” Zielke said. “This might require further investments. And this is exactly what we are examining and assessing in our current strategy process.”
Shares Slump
Shares of all three banks declined in early trading, with Commerzbank slumping as much as 5.2%, ABN Amro falling 5.7% and UniCredit losing 3.6%.
Central bank cuts and rising trade tensions come just as Commerzbank and UniCredit prepare to update investors on strategy later this year, with Zielke indicating Wednesday that both dynamics will factor in its plans. Two weeks earlier Deutsche Bank had said the interest rate environment had already worsened since it finalized its latest turnaround plan.
Commerzbank, which started to pivot away from investment banking and toward lending shortly after Zielke became CEO three years ago, has been the subject of takeover speculation, though any talks have not proceeded beyond informal contacts, people familiar with the matter have said. Dutch lender  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV and Italy’s UniCredit have been named as potential buyers after the collapse of earlier merger talks with Deutsche Bank.
UniCredit CEO Jean Pierre Mustier has focused on cutting costs and cleaning up the balance sheet to boost profit amid weak earnings from lending. He’s cut about 14,000 jobs since taking over about three years ago and may eliminate as many as 10,000 more under a new business plan to be outlined later this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Lower for Longer
“With rates expected to be lower for much longer, we decided to adjust our 2019 revenue guidance,” Mustier said on Wednesday. The Italian lender lowered its 2019 sales goal to 18.7 billion euros from 19.8 billion euros previously, part of which was due to the sale of its stake in Finecobank SpA.
Barely finished cleaning up from their last recessions, central banks across the globe are swinging back toward rescue mode as the U.S.-China trade war nudges the world economy toward its first recession in a decade. Having cut rates a week ago for the first time since 2008, the Federal Reserve is on course to do so again next month.
The European Central Bank isn’t even close to finishing its last cleanup. President Mario Draghi has kept a key interest rate below zero for five years, effectively punishing banks and savers for holding deposits, rather than spending or investing them. He’s expected to loosen monetary policy again in September, after saying that the outlook is getting “worse and worse.”
Remedial Action
ABN Amro, too, signaled that ultra low interest rates in Europe are eating into margins, forcing it to take remedial action to shore up profit. While second quarter net income of 693 million euros ($777 million) beat estimates for 638 million euros, the Amsterdam-based bank said the impact of rates on deposit margins is prompting it to explore different revenue opportunities and focus on “strict cost discipline.”
Commerzbank in particular is exposed to trade tensions because of its extensive network of corporate clients, many of which rely on exports. German industrial production registered its biggest annual decline in almost a decade, a report showed Wednesday, highlighting the severity of the trade-inflicted manufacturing slump in Europe’s largest economy.
That’s hurting lending to the country’s many mid-sized corporations. Operating profit at the Commerzbank unit that caters to them slumped 90% from year earlier, to just 22 million euros, as higher provisions for bad loans offset an increase in income from lending. The bank said “single cases” in the second quarter were responsible for the hit, without providing details. The bank recently announced that it will replace division head Michael Reuther with former ING executive Roland Boekhout.
The business catering to individual clients and small businesses did better as it takes longer for individuals to feel the pain. The unit reported a 37% increase in operating profit and higher revenue.
Commerzbank’s net income also beat analysts’ estimates, but that was mainly because of lower taxes. The lender said it still expects a “slight” increase in profit this year, but that goal “has become significantly more ambitious.”

677,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 05:21AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Bank Warnings Expose Fragility of Market Recovery,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Investors took the “glass half empty” view of Europe’s banking sector in early trading on Wednesday, pushing some of the continent’s biggest bank stocks down by as much as 5% after a mixed bag of quarterly updates.
Italy’s Unicredit (MI:CRDI), Germany’s Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and Dutch-based ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) all fell sharply after their respective reports, as markets focused on initial signs that the slowdown in the eurozone economy, and the European Central Bank’s likely response to it, will hit their results hard in the quarters to come.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), Germany’s second-largest publicly-owned bank, fell 5% after reporting that its provisions against bad loans more than doubled from a year ago. That’s an unwelcome reminder that the cyclical tailwind that has helped bank results across the region in the last three years is blowing itself out. Commerzbank’s overall bad loan book actually fell as a share of overall loans (due largely to it buying market share with lending at razor-thin margins), but it is no longer able to pad earnings by releasing previous provisions against risks that failed to materialize.
Although Commerzbank upheld its profit forecast for the year, it said “this target has become significantly more ambitious given the earnings development in the first half of the year, the noticeable worsening of the macroeconomic situation, and the increasingly uncertain geopolitical situation.”
Commerzbank also referenced the “weaker German economy”, which was in evidence Wednesday with figures showing  industrial production in the euro zone’s engine room fell 5.2% on the year in June, well below expectations of a 3.1% drop and its worst fall in a decade.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI), meanwhile, fell 3.7% after lowering its full-year revenue guidance by 300 million euros ($336 million), citing “the prevailing environment with rates expected to be lower for much longer.”
That’s despite it upholding its forecasts for reducing its pile of bad loans to just over 10 billion euros this year, “well below” its initial target for 2019.
ABN Amro fell 3.8% after it, too, warned of the negative impact of lower interest rates on lending margins and profits. The warning overshadowed a heavy hint of a dividend increase at the end of the year.
“Interest rates continued to come down in the last quarter, predominantly impacting deposit margins,” said CEO Kees van Dijkhuizen. “We remain focused on our targets in a challenging environment.
Commerzbank shares have now fallen 12% in the last week, while ABN’s have fallen 11.1% and Unicredit’s 7.5%.
The banks’ poor numbers set them apart from the broader market, which continued to recover as the shock of last week’s trade war escalation receded. By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.8% at 370.54, while the German Dax was up 1.1% and the U.K. FTSE 100 up 0.7%."

Chemical parks supply an industrial infrastructure such as electricity, steam, natural gas and services to producers. 
Shares in Bayer and Lanxess gained 4.2% and 3.8%, respectively, at 0800 GMT after securing what analysts said was a better-than-expected price after months of negotiations.
Lanxess, which had initially intended to hold on to its stake, took in about 624 million euros in proceeds after a 20% tax deduction for an asset that was valued at zero on its balance sheet.
Lanxess shares were among the biggest gainers in German midcap index MDAX (MDAXI), with JP Morgan analysts seeing Lanxess benefit from increased flexibility for future acquisitions, higher payouts to shareholders and better pension funding. 
MIRA has committed to not selling off parts of Currenta - a supplier of electricity, steam, natural gas and industrial services - over the next three years, the head of MIRA's German business, Hilko Schomerus, told Reuters.
""We are convinced of the benefits of the integrated business model of the Currenta group,"" he said.
He added the investment would offer adequate returns at low risks, with MIRA intending to hold on to Currenta for 10 to 12 years.
Bayer's stake in Currenta fetched an equity value of about 1.17 billion euros after deducting net debt and pension obligations. In addition, Bayer agreed to sell real estate on which Currenta operates for 180 million euros.
Lanxess, a maker of lubricant additives, drug ingredients and leather-tanning chemicals, said it secured a service and supply agreement with MIRA for an initial 10 years, for ""reliable infrastructure at competitive conditions"" at its main German production sites. 
""The sale of our stake will give us additional financial leeway to drive forward our growth course in specialty chemicals,"" said Lanxess CEO Matthias Zachert. 
Bayer had initially planned to sell the Currenta stake - a legacy asset with little benefit for its core drugs and agriculture businesses - to its former industrial chemicals subsidiary Covestro (DE:1COV), but could not agree on a valuation.
Covestro and Lanxess (DE:LXSG), both former Bayer businesses, are Currenta's main customers.
Reuters reported in March that Macquarie had emerged as the leading bidder for Bayer's stake, beating out rival suitors DWS (DE:DWSG) and KKR (N:KKR).

679,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>","Asian stocks turn lower on lingering trade war fears, yuan slips","By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - A cautious calm returned to stock markets on Wednesday as softer rhetoric from Washington on the U.S.-China trade war soothed investors, though demand for safe-haven assets underscored lingering anxiety.
Europe's STOXX 600 climbed 0.7%, recovering from a three-day sell-off as investors fled after an escalation in the trade war. MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.2%. 
But gold, the Japanese yen and government debt remained in high demand as investors remained wary of riskier assets. 
U.S. shares gained overnight after President Donald Trump downplayed worries of a lengthy trade war and senior adviser Larry Kudlow said Trump's administration is planning to host a Chinese delegation for talks in September. Wall Street futures gauges also rose. 
The U.S. administration's remarks marked a shift in tone from recent days, when Beijing warned that Washington's labeling China as a currency manipulator on Monday would have severe consequences for the global financial order. 
Still, market players voiced caution. Trump's threat to impose additional tariffs on more Chinese products is set to take effect in less than a month. 
""There is some cautious buying creeping back in,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. ""But if you want that to be sustained you have to look towards September 1, when the new tariffs kick in, and whether or not Trump presses ahead with them.""
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was slightly lower. 
Also easing the mood were signs that China is intervening to steady the yuan after its recent sharp fall, allaying investor fears of a global currency war. 
The U.S. Treasury designated China a currency manipulator on Monday, after it allowed the yuan to weaken below 7 per dollar for the first time in over a decade. The U.S. move rattled financial markets and dimmed hopes the trade war was ending.
Since then, China's state banks have been active in the onshore yuan forwards market, tightening dollar supply and supporting the Chinese currency, sources told Reuters.
The yuan still dropped 0.2% to 7.0708 in offshore markets despite the support. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set its official reference rate at an 11-year low, keeping currency markets on edge. 
""We had a little bit of recovery yesterday, but this morning we are seeing that stalling due to the PBOC fixing the dollar-yen higher again,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""It has caused markets to again be in a bit of a risk-off mode."" 
SAFE HAVENS IN DEMAND 
The skittish mood was underlined by continuing demand for currencies and commodities considered safe havens.
Gold reached a six-year high of $1,489.76 per ounce. The Japanese yen rose 0.2% to 106.27, although that was still some way from levels seen on Monday when the trade war's escalation panicked investors.
U.S. bonds have also retained much of their gains made in the past week. Ten-year Treasury notes yielded 1.66% percent, their lowest since 2016, as investors bet on another rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September.
Fixed income markets have benefited from fears the U.S-China trade war would raise the risk of a global recession, strengthening the case for policy easing by central banks.
Germany's 10-year bond yield fell to record lows deep in negative territory as a bigger-than-expected interest rate cut in New Zealand and weak German data gave further impetus to a rally in bond markets.
German industrial output fell more than expected in June, adding to signs that Europe's biggest economy contracted in the second quarter as its exporters were caught up in trade disputes.

In commodity markets, oil prices slipped, with the potential for damage to the global economy and to fuel demand from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute casting a shadow over the market.
International benchmark Brent crude futures were at $58.79 a barrel by 0759 GMT, down 14 cents, or 0.05%, and trading near seven-month lows.

680,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 04:01AM ET</span>",Italian tax authorities ask for information on UBS clients,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Italy's tax authorities have made a request to their Swiss counterparts for information about possible tax evasion by UBS (S:UBSG) clients, Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger reported on Wednesday.
The Italian authorities are seeking help on Italian residents who held UBS accounts in Switzerland between 2015 and 2016 and who have not given evidence their account were tax compliant.
People covered by the request now have 20 days to make themselves known, the Swiss authorities said.
The bank is facing two separate investigations in Italy and a court case in France over allegations it enabled cross-border tax cheats to hide assets in Switzerland.
Italian prosecutors allege that unidentified UBS managers were responsible for money-laundering because they invested client funds that were the fruit of tax evasion.
The bank agreed in June to pay 101 million euros ($113 million) to resolve a dispute over money laundering and taxes with Italy's tax authority, according to regulatory filings released with UBS's second-quarter earnings.
UBS has declined to comment on the settlement. It wasn't able to comment immediately on the second investigation.
Switzerland's highest court ruled last month that historical data of about 40,000 UBS clients must be handed to French tax authorities in a landmark case that could set a precedent for foreign governments seeking information from Swiss banks.
UBS has received various disclosure orders from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration based on requests for international administrative assistance in tax matters, a UBS spokeswoman said.
""The bank has completed a tax compliance program with its European clients and implemented the Automatic Exchange of Information as the new international standard,"" she added. ""UBS was among the first banks in the industry requiring documentation of tax disclosure from its clients."""

(Reuters) - Foreign investors dumped Asian equities in the first six days of August after two months of buying, as the United States ramped up pressure on China with a $300 billion trade barrage last week.
Overseas investors sold about $4.5 billion of regional equities during the period, data from stock exchanges in South Korea, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam showed.
(Graphic: Foreign investments in Asian equities - https://tmsnrt.rs/2MIkKfQ)
Sharp outflows from Asian markets point to increased worries that trade tensions between the world's two top economies could escalate, and regional economies and corporate earnings might deteriorate further.
U.S. President Donald Trump said last Thursday he would slap a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports starting Sept. 1, marking an end to a truce in the year-long trade war that was struck in June.
In response, China let its currency weaken 1.4% on Monday, sending it past the key 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade, and then the United States labeled Beijing a currency manipulator.
MSCI Asia-ex-Japan index (MIAPJ0000PUS) had fallen 6.4% this month as of Tuesday's close, after shedding 1.7% in July.
""Recent foreign outflows from Asian equities clearly suggest that investors are getting nervous on markets given escalating trade tensions,"" said Chetan Seth, a strategist for Nomura Securities in Singapore.
It might get harder for the United States and China to ease or soften these tensions given how events have unfolded over the last few days, he said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said markets were pricing in a less than 15% chance of a trade deal being agreed. It estimated 13% and 8% cumulative earnings downside for MSCI China and MSCI Asia-ex-Japan in 2019-2020 under a ""no deal"" scenario.
Taiwan and India saw the biggest outflows in Asia, with net selling of $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion respectively. South Korea also witnessed outflows, of $919 million.
Taiwan and South Korean companies are more exposed to the Sino-U.S. trade tussle as they have extensive ties with tech firms in China and are part of their supply chains.
Indian shares were undermined last month after the federal budget raised import tariffs on many items, hiked taxes on the rich and proposed changes in shareholding norms.
A slew of disappointing earnings by Asian firms for the second quarter also increased investor caution on regional markets.
Refinitiv data showed major Asian firms such as Tata Motors (NS:TAMO), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Nissan (T:7201) have posted second-quarter earnings below expectations.
""So far 1H earnings in Asia-ex-Japan markets have been below estimates – although still early days. The question investors need to answer is what happens to 2020 earnings as markets in 2H will start discounting next year's earnings,"" said Nomura's Seth.
""If trade tensions persist, there may be more downside to current consensus earnings estimates.""
In July, foreigners had invested $234 million in Asia, much lesser than $4.2 billion inflows in June."

The company announced a new environmental and social policy in its annual report released on Wednesday, emphasizing its commitment to bring emissions to net zero, in line with global goals set out in the 2015 landmark Paris climate agreement.
The bank joins a host of other Australian companies adopting similar policies to combat climate change, and reduce the country's reliance on coal-generated power.
Late last month, the world's biggest miner BHP Group (L:BHPB) (AX:BHP) said it would invest $400 million over five years to reduce emissions, while insurers Suncorp Group (AX:SUN) and QBE Insurance Group (AX:QBE) have also set targets to eliminate their exposure to coal by 2025 and 2030, respectively.
The trend to move away from fossil fuels has gathered pace over the last few years since the Paris agreement, with pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and others limiting exposure to oil, gas and coal stocks.
Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, recently said it would also be reducing some of its holdings in companies operating in environmentally harmful sectors like coal.
CBA will make A$15 billion ($10.07 billion) of funding available to low carbon projects by 2025, the lender said in its environmental policy framework.
A report this month by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the world is at risk of not meeting the Paris targets, and according to its analysis, coal, gas and oil will still contribute about 85% of energy supply by 2040.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has designs on making robot helpers for your home, and has enlisted a Japanese startup that specializes in artificial intelligence to jump-start its plan.
Japan's biggest automaker and Tokyo-based Preferred Networks Inc will carry out joint research to develop so-called service robots that are ""capable of learning in typical living environments"", the companies said in statements on Wednesday. 
The two firms have already been collaborating on driverless vehicles since 2014.
Eighty-year-old manufacturing giant Toyota is trying to transform itself and adapt to technology, such as ride-hailing and automated driving, that is disrupting the auto industry.
Toyota sees robots as part of that effort, particularly in Japan, where it aims to have them in homes and hospitals to support one of the world's fastest ageing populations.
For the project announced on Wednesday, Toyota said it would provide a dozen units of its Human Support Robot, or HSR, to Preferred Networks.
The companies will cooperate on development over the next three years, including the sharing of intellectual property.
Preferred Networks is already using the robot as a platform for its advanced artificial intelligence software. At an exhibition in Tokyo last year the robot tidied a messy room, distinguishing between trash and dirty towels.
Toyota has been working on service robots since 2004, and has a number of models under development. But HSR is the one it sees as closest to being ready for commercial applications. 

Basically a single arm on a wheeled base with a sensor-filled head on top, the robot will also be used at next year's summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, to help with simple tasks such as fetching drinks for some spectators.

Millions have taken to Hong Kong streets in anti-government protests that have intensified since mid-June, at times forcing banks, stores, shopping malls, restaurants and even government buildings to close as the demonstrations degenerated into violent clashes between police and activists.
Hong Kong's flagship airline, Cathay Pacific, said on Wednesday the protests reduced inbound passenger traffic in July and travelers were weighing on forward bookings, as it reported it swung to a half-year profit.
Thousands of protesters descended on the Chinese-ruled city's airport in July, where some chanted ""free Hong Kong"" and others handed out flyers explaining the city's crisis to tourists.
Protesters plan to rally at the airport again this weekend, potentially causing further disruptions after a strike on Monday saw more than 200 flights canceled. 
The  Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd  (HK:0045), owner of the opulent Peninsula hotel in the bustling shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui, said it too was worried about the impact of the protests on tourist arrivals as well as the broader economy.
""We are concerned about the effect this political uncertainty may have on our results, especially given the proportion of our income which is earned in Hong Kong,"" said Clement Kwok, CEO of the hotel group, in an earnings statement on Wednesday.
In June, Hong Kong-based cosmetic and healthcare products chain operator  Bonjour Holdings Ltd  (HK:0653) issued a profit warning which it partly blamed on the protests. 
What started as an angry response to a now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, now includes demands for greater democracy and the resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.
Hong Kong retail sales, a key part of the city's economy, felt a growing impact in June from the mass protests, falling 6.7% from a year earlier in the biggest decline since February.
Many businesses in Hong Kong are already facing strains from China's economic slowdown, a weak Chinese yuan and fallout from the Sino-U.S. trade war.

Tourism to Hong Kong, especially from mainland China, has dropped markedly, weighing on hotel occupancy rates. Britain, Japan, Singapore and Australia have issued travel alerts following the violent protests.

Second-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) declined to 21 million euros ($23.54 million) at the division. ""The market in Great Britain is currently particularly challenging,"" Chief Financial Officer Marc Spieker said.
E.ON is currently in the process of buying the retail and networks activities from rival Innogy (DE:IGY) as part of an asset swap with peer RWE (DE:RWEG), a deal it expects to close in September.

State-owned China News Service first reported on Wednesday the latest certification target for the homegrown plane, citing a speech made by the chief designer Wu Guanghui for the C919 program at a recent industry event. 
A COMAC spokesman confirmed the report to Reuters, but said the date was subject to regulatory approval and the aircraft's safety remains a top priority. 
In June last year, the company said it was aiming to obtain the certification by the end of 2020. Analysts had considered the target ambitious given the test planes have flown relatively few hours since the first C919 flew in 2017.
The deputy head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) Li Jian said in May that more flaws in aircraft design, manufacturing, airworthiness compliance and operational suitability were being identified, as work continued for certification of the jet.
Last week, the fourth prototype of the C919 plane completed its first test flight.
COMAC is planning to roll out two more test planes in the second half this year to speed up flight testing.

Each of the companies faces claims that several of their power generating units contravened regulations over a period of several months, not just on Sept. 28, 2016, the day of the blackout. South Australia is the country's most wind power-reliant state. (https://reut.rs/2M3y0Mn)
As well as seeking the introduction of new compliance programs and legal costs, the regulator is targeting penalties of up to A$100,000 ($67,220) per contravention. If the court rules in the regulator's favor, that could mean potential overall charges of at least tens of millions of dollars.
The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) alleges that AGL, Neoen, New Zealand's  Tilt Renewables  Ltd (NZ:TLT) and Chinese state-owned Pacific Hydro failed to ensure their plants met requirements to be able to ride through system disturbances.
The state lost all power on Sept. 28 after two tornadoes damaged transmission lines, disrupting voltages, which triggered protection features at nine wind farms that suddenly reduced their output.
The sharp drop in power from the wind farms overloaded demand for power on a transmission line from a neighboring state, which then tripped that link off, cutting the state off from back-up electricity supply.
""These alleged failures contributed to the black system event and meant that AEMO (the Australian Energy Market Operator) was not fully informed when responding to system wide failure in South Australia in September 2016,"" AER Chair Paula Conboy said in a statement.
AGL on Wednesday called the allegations ""highly technical"" and said it believed it had complied with its legal obligations but would consider its position.
In a statement to the New Zealand stock exchange, Tilt said it believed it had ""acted in good faith"" and would continue to try to resolve the matter with the regulator.
Neoen and Pacific Hydro were not immediately available to comment.
The blackout in South Australia - where wind accounts for more than 35% of power generating capacity - led to widespread concern about the rapid uptake of intermittent renewable energy weakening the country's reliable power supply.
""The AER has brought these proceedings to send a strong signal to all energy businesses about the importance of compliance with performance standards to promote system security and reliability,"" the regulator's Conboy said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean imports of Japanese beer slumped 45% in July from the previous month in the wake of a consumer boycott sparked by an escalating political and economic dispute between the two Asian neighbors, data showed.
Japan shipped $4.3 million worth of beer to South Korea in July, down from $6.6 million a year earlier and $7.9 million in June, according to preliminary customs office data provided by lawmaker Kim Jung-woo to Reuters.
On July 4, Japan tightened export controls for materials used to make chips, South Korea's top export item, intensifying a row over wartime forced labor and inviting a consumer backlash in Korea.
Such anger has prompted a widespread boycott of Japanese products and services, from beer, clothes and cars to travel.
Many supermarkets and convenience stores have been removing Japanese items such as beer from their stands and stopping new orders.
South Korea buys 61% of Japan’s beer exports, spending 7.9 billion yen ($73 million) in 2018 for the shipments, according to Japan's finance ministry.
Asahi Group Holdings (T:2502) said last week the spread of the South Korean consumer boycott of Japanese goods was affecting its beer sales as it lowered its profit guidance slightly.
A boycott campaign is expected to grow as Japan is taking steps to remove Korea's fast-track export status, industry officials and experts say.
Japanese automakers such as Toyota and Honda are bracing for further sales drops in South Korea in the coming months, after they posted sharp sales declines last month.
A slew of South Korean airlines are also suspending flights to Japan as they brace for a dwindling number of tourists. South Korea's second-largest carrier Asiana Airlines Inc (KS:020560) and budget carrier Eastar Jet said on Wednesday they would temporarily halt a combined four more flights between Korea and Japan."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that some data from early testing of Novartis' (S:NOVN) more than $2 million gene therapy Zolgensma was manipulated, but the agency believes the treatment should remain on the market.
The FDA said it is carefully assessing the situation. 
The manipulated data was used to illustrate comparability between an early version of Zolgensma and the later version of the treatment, which was manufactured using a different process.
The FDA does not believe that the manipulation impacts the safety or testing surrounding the version of the drug, which treats spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the leading genetic cause of death in infants.
Novartis' Avexis unit informed the FDA of the data manipulation on June 28, the regulator said. 
 Novartis  acquired the therapy's maker in 2018, and the drugmaker was aware of the manipulation as early as March - more than two months before the treatment's approval, the FDA said.
The regulator plans to take action against the company including possible civil or criminal penalties. 
In a statement on Tuesday, Novartis said it is ""fully confident"" in the safety, quality and efficacy of Zolgensma.
The issue is not expected to impact the timing of its ongoing Zolgensma regulatory filings and development programs, the drugmaker added. 
""The data in question were a small portion of our overall submission and are limited to an older process no longer in use.""
Zolgensma - the world's most expensive drug - was approved as a one-time treatment for SMA in late May.
The disease often leads to paralysis, breathing difficulty and death within months for babies born with the most serious Type I form. SMA affects about one in every 10,000 live births, with 50% to 70% having Type I disease.
The FDA said its concerns were currently limited to a small portion of product testing data included in the marketing application for the therapy.
According to an inspection note released by the agency, there were discrepancies in some of its mouse survival data results.
The manipulated data does not change the FDA's positive assessment of information from human clinical trials, it said. The agency said it will continue to evaluate the integrity of the product testing data used in the development of Zolgensma's manufacturing process.

U.S.-listed shares of Swiss drugmaker Novartis closed down 2.8% at $88.20 on Tuesday. Shares of Biogen Inc (O:BIIB), which makes rival SMA treatment Spinraza, closed up 2.1% at $240.17 and shares of PTC Therapeutics Inc (O:PTCT), which is also developing an SMA treatment, closed 4.9% higher at $44.75.

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) reported a steeper earnings decline than Wall Street expected on Tuesday as the company poured money into its ambitious plunge into streaming media and began folding in assets purchased from Twenty-First Century Fox.
Shares of Disney, which had risen 27% this year and hit an all-time high last week, dropped as much as 5% in after-hours trading to $135.
Excluding certain items, Disney earned $1.35 per share for the quarter that ended in June, below average analyst estimates of $1.75 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Disney, the owner of ESPN, a movie studio and theme parks, is investing heavily in digital media platforms to challenge the dominance of Netflix Inc (O:NFLX).
Its biggest digital bet, a family-friendly subscription service called Disney+, is scheduled to debut in November. Shows aimed at adults will be concentrated on Hulu, which Disney now controls.
The direct-to-consumer and international unit reported an operating loss of $553 million from April to June, wider than the $441 million loss analysts were expecting, and up from a $168 million loss from a year earlier. Costs piled up from consolidation of Hulu and spending on Disney+ and the ESPN+ streaming service, Disney said.
Future digital investments will lead to a roughly $900 million operating loss in the direct-to-consumer unit in the quarter that ends in September, the company said, compared with expectations of a $593 million loss.
For the just-ended quarter, executives said Fox's film studio performed worse than expected while the costs to broadcast cricket through Fox's Star India were higher than anticipated.
""Some of the other misses seem to be related to the integration of Fox,"" said analyst Jim Nail at Forrester. ""I would speculate that they have decided to take all their lumps this quarter and put all this 'bad' news together, clearing the board for better results next quarter.""
Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company was focused on integrating the Fox film and TV assets and using them with Disney's businesses to move quickly into streaming video.
""Nothing is more important to us than getting this right,"" Iger said. ""We remain confident in our strategy and our ability to successfully execute it.""
Iger also said it would bundle its streaming services, charging $12.99 a month for Disney+, ESPN+ and ad-supported Hulu, starting in November.
At the theme parks unit, overall operating income rose 4% to $1.7 billion but declined at Disney's U.S. parks. The company attributed the drop to expenses for a ""Star Wars""-themed expansion at California's Disneyland and lower attendance.
Media networks, which includes ESPN, the Disney Channels and FX, reported a 7% increase in operating income to $2.1 billion.
A blockbuster movie slate led by ""Avengers: Endgame,"" the highest-grossing movie of all time, helped boost revenue to $20.2 billion. That was short of the $21.5 billion that analysts expected.
""Endgame"" boosted movie studio profit to $792 million, along with hits ""Toy Story 4"" and ""Aladdin."""
701,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 05:37PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Rebounds Sharply After Monday's Drubbing,"Investing.com - U.S. stocks rebounded strongly Tuesday after China stabilized its currency and investors snapped up bargains.
The market gained back roughly 40% of what it lost on Monday when stocks suffered their worst one-day losses of the year.
The S&P 500, down 3% on Monday, gained back 1.33% on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell 767 points Monday, rose more than 1.22%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.39% after falling 3.5% on Monday.
At first, the impetus fwas China announcing it would value its currency, the yuan, at 7 to the dollar. The government let the yuan slump Monday against the dollar to retaliate against President Donald Trump's decision to impose 10% tariffs on Chinese goods imported into the United States starting Sept. 1.
Both decisions, plus a U.S. announcement that it was branding China a currency manipulator, were clear signals that optimism early in the year that a new trade deal was close was unfounded. Now the worry is the trade fight would extend well into 2020, bringing with it the prospect of more painful market volatility.
Twenty-four of the 30 Dow stocks were higher, along with 87 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index, which was up 1.4%. On Monday, all of the stocks in both indexes finished in the red.
The market was led by strength in technology stocks, especially Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). In addition, consumer stocks such as   Nike   (NYSE:NKE),   Lululemon Athletica   (NASDAQ:LULU )and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) were winners.
The only weak spots in the market were energy and materials stocks.
Oil prices were lower, a byproduct of the trade fight. West Texas Intermediate  crude fell 1.94% to $53.63 a barrel and is down 8.45% in August. Brent crude, the global benchmark, settled at $58.94, down 1.45%. It's dropped 9.6%, mostly on the worries over the U.S.-China trade fight. 
Among the losers in the energy sector were BP (NYSE:BP), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).
Chemical stocks slumped. Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) hit a 52-week low. U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) and   Alcoa   (NYSE:AA) also moved lower.
:SLB).
The rally was almost a guarantee after Monday's selloff because technical levels, such as relative strength indexes, dropped so low so fast as to signal -- loudly -- that much of the stock market had become undervalued. 
The major averages had been drifting lower since hitting record highs on July 25 and you don't know how markets will perform going forward -- especially with the trade fight continuing.
A worry for Wednesday's market as well may be an earnings disappointment after the market closed from Dow component Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS).
Disney blamed the disappointment on the costs of integrating the 21st Century Fox business acquired earlier this year in a $71.3 billion deal. Disney shares were off 2.5% after hours after rising 2.6% in regular trading.
Disney's movie business (what it calls studio entertainment) saw a 33% revenue increase, thanks to the success of such blockbuster film as ""Avengers: Endgame.""
Earnings are due Wednesday from companies including Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) and   Overstock.com   (NASDAQ:OSTK).
Winners and Losers in the S&P 500
Aerospace component manufacturer Transdigm Group (NYSE:TDG), software developer   Take-Two Interactive   Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) and Zletis, maker of medicines and pharmaceuticals, were among the top S&P 500 performers for the day. Zoetis was spun out of   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) in 2013.
International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF), fertilizer maker Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) and generic drug maker Mylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL) were among the S&P 500 laggards."
702,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 05:35PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. Fed Speak, 10Y Treasury Auction in Spotlight
The economic calendar is thin, with Chicago Fed President Evans hosting a media chat on Wednesday, while the U.S. Treasury is set to auction off $27 billion in 10-year notes. 
A speech from Evans due 12:00 PM ET (5PM GMT) comes as his St. Louis counterpart, James Bullard, on Monday said he feels further rate cuts “may be desirable” later this year.
U.S. Treasuries will likely come into focus Wednesday when the U.S. Treasury is set to auction off $27 billion in 10-year notes. 
The US 10-Year yield, which broke below 1.7% overnight Tuesday for the first time since the fall of 2016, traded lower, finishing at 1.716, down from 1.736% on Monday.
Ahead of the auction, analysts outlined numerous tailwinds, including additional rate cuts by the Fed and easing from the European Central Bank that could prop up demand for the benchmark note - given other sovereign bonds like the German Bund are offering negative yields.
2. China Trade Data Due
Traders will look to China’s latest trade data report for an insight into the health of the world’s second largest economy, with both exports and imports forecast to show an accelerated decline.
China’s imports are expected to have declined by 7.6% year-on-year, steeper than the 7.3% decline in June, while exports is forecast to have declined by 2.2%.
The faster fall in imports than exports is expected to narrow the country’s trade surplus.
3. EIA Crude Inventory Numbers Eyed
The Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly petroleum report, due Wednesday, could prove a timely distraction as sentiment on oil prices has been hurt by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. 
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 1.167 million barrels for the week ended Aug. 5.
Crude oil futures fell 1.9% to settle at $53.77 a barrel after giving up intraday gains amid fears that a protracted US-China trade war would hurt global growth and heap further pressure on oil demand. 
“China now realizes that if they use its currency as a weapon it will not just have to answer to the US but to all of the countries in the G20,"" said Phil Flynn at Price Futures. ""Yet trade war fears are still stoking fears of weak oil demand. Oil is rebounding but it is still wobbly because it fears the potential trade war fallout.""
U.S. weekly production, which remains near record highs of 12.2 million barrels a day, will likely also garner attention."

705,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 05:05PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Assets Turn Toxic as Trade War and Protests Cloud Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Investor anxiety is visible just about everywhere in Hong Kong’s markets as recession warnings and escalating protests strain sentiment to breaking point.
While most of the world recovered Tuesday from a yuan-induced meltdown, Hong Kong saw the biggest spike in interbank rates in more than a decade, the longest stretch of equity declines since 1984 and the wildest stock swings in four years. Bears reloaded on the local dollar in a way not seen since 2017, betting it will soon break through the weak end of its trading band.
The threat from the trade war and weeks of local unrest is already showing in the property market, as well as tourist numbers, hotel occupancy and retail sales. A weak yuan is another cause for concern, as it will damp spending from mainland visitors and pressure earnings for firms that rely on China. Profits for members of the Hang Seng Index are forecast to drop the most since the global financial crisis this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
“There is risk-off sentiment in general,” said Michael Liang, chief investment officer at Foundation Asset Management (HK) Ltd. “Hong Kong’s political risk is definitely a part of it. Fewer people are willing to invest in the city’s assets.”
In some of the Chinese government’s strongest comments yet on the unrest that’s gripped the Asian financial hub since June, officials on Tuesday urged Hong Kong citizens to stand up to protesters. That followed Monday’s general strike that led to traffic chaos, violence, tear gas and flight cancellations in the most disruptive day since the protests started.
The MSCI Hong Kong Index -- which unlike the more widely-used Hang Seng Index doesn’t include Chinese heavyweights -- is suffering its worst stretch of losses since 1984. That was the year U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing, committing to some of the terms for the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.
Hong Kong’s currency, while pegged to the greenback, is also influenced by the yuan due to the city’s close economic ties with China. It fell the most in more than three-and-a-half years Monday, tracking losses across Asia. The Hong Kong dollar’s 12-month forward points briefly spiked to 163 Tuesday, in a sign that some global hedge funds may betting against the currency. That was highest level since early 2017.
The moves are affecting local borrowing costs, which underpin mortgages in one of the world’s least affordable housing markets. The rates are already facing pressure from tightening liquidity, which sent some tenors to decade-highs last month. One-month Hong Kong dollar interbank rates, known as Hibor, jumped the most since 2008 Tuesday.
Rates have remained ultra-low in Hong Kong since the financial crisis, while a huge amount of cash sloshing around in the financial system has helped fuel rallies in the stock and property markets. Now, stocks are falling and data last week showed July home sales fell 32% in value from a year earlier, while volume was down 21%.
And it could get worse: market watchers have warned home prices and retail rents may fall in the short term because of recent political unrest. A residential site was sold last month in a government tender for HK$11,842 ($1,511) per square foot -- the lowest price in more than two years. A purchasing-managers index fell to the lowest since March 2009 in July, signaling a contraction for a 16th month.
Hong Kong has a track record of resilience in the face of crises. From Asia’s financial implosion during the late 1990s to the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the global credit crunch of 2008, the city has always found a way to come out stronger.
That doesn’t mean a turnaround is near, however. The recent turmoil is making it almost impossible for investors to discern the outlook for Hong Kong assets.
“We don’t advise investors to time the market,” said Tai Hui, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management chief market strategist for the Asia-Pacific region. “It is a very difficult exercise.”"
706,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 05:02PM ET</span>",Volatility Erupts Everywhere as Trade War Becomes a Currency War,"(Bloomberg) -- Volatility is here and set to spread.
That’s the view from Wall Street, which holds that Tuesday’s rebound in risk assets from the biggest decline in the S&P 500 Index of 2019 is just a lull in what has traditionally been a rocky month.
Selling sparked by forced adjustments among systematic investors and a plunge in global equity sentiment combine with the seasonal pattern of volatility to thoroughly alarm Masanari Takada, cross-asset and quantitative strategist at Nomura.
“It would be a mistake to dismiss the possibility of a Lehman-like shock as a mere tail risk,’’ the strategist warned.
The S&P 500 plunged 3% Monday after China let its currency weaken to the lowest in 11 years, sparking fears that the trade war had entered a more unpredictable stage. Treasuries surged with gold and the yen on demand for havens. Risk assets bounced back somewhat Tuesday after Beijing strengthened the yuan, but investor nerves remained frayed.
“The waters appear to as opaque now as they were in the fall of 2015 when China hard-landing fears defined global risk markets (if for different types of reasons),’’ Michael Purves, chief executive officer of Tallbacken Capital Advisors LLC, wrote in a note to clients. “Accordingly, dip buying will be tricky in the near term, and we expect volatility will be elevated, until valuation resets handsomely (such as it did in December).’’
The Cboe Volatility Index slipped to 22 Tuesday after almost hitting 25 a day earlier. It has averaged 15.6 this year. In the short term, that means markets will have to digest an onslaught of selling from funds that will now be deleveraging to realign their exposure to equities based on a set level of market unrest.
“Call it a few tens of billions of equities to sell over the next couple of sessions,’’ said Benn Eifert, chief investment officer of QVR Advisors.
So far, institutional selling of short-term puts in equities -- which has the effect of dampening stock volatility -- hasn’t reached nearly the same scale as in the fourth quarter or May drawdowns, according to Eifert. This smaller supply of downside volatility on offer has been a partial contributor to the magnitude of the VIX’s recent surge.
The acute reaction in equity volatility prompted Macro Risk Advisors to recommend alternative methods to protect against a further stock sell-off. Derivatives and quantitative strategist Maxwell Grinacoff suggests targeting exchange-traded funds that focus on gold and its miners.
The firm recommended buying call spreads in the GLD (NYSE:GLD) and GDX (NYSE:GDX) ETFs to take advantage of the rich skew on the call side.
“This ‘tilt’ in the basket of hedges that would traditionally be more heavily weighted in equity index protection is driven by gold’s higher correlation to CNH (which could see further devaluation as the trade war persists),’’ he wrote.
With currency brought to the fore of the escalating clash between the world’s two largest economies, it’s difficult to see investor angst only reaching extremes in equities.
“Vol is still underpricing the risk of escalation -- especially a currency war,’’ wrote Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) strategists led by Gonzalo Asis. “With much room left to run to match Aug 2015 returns and cross-asset volatility mostly below long-term averages, options appear attractive to position for further stress.’’
Only U.S. equity and oil volatility are above their long-term averages going back to May 2007, according to Bank of America, while foreign exchange vol is just in the 26th percentile over this timeframe. The team believes “the rising risk that the trade war morphs into a currency war” will foster the outperformance of this asset’s volatility much faster than in 2015, making currency-based hedges particularly attractive at this juncture.
The potential for heightened foreign-exchange swings threatens to upend a favored strategy use to generate positive returns in a world awash with negative yields. For instance, the euro-funded Brazil carry trade erased months of gains in the three opening sessions of August.
“We continue to caution that carry trade unwinding via FX-carry or bond-carry is one of the biggest risk at hand,’’ writes Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at Maybank. “With EUR and JPY’s funding currency status being further enhanced due to their relative ‘cheapness’ amid ECB and BoJ’s willingness to keep monetary policies accommodative, a re-escalation in trade tensions may well see funding currencies (especially more so for JPY) in demand.’’"
707,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 05:01PM ET</span>","Walt Disney Earnings, Revenue Miss in Q3; Blames Fox","Investing.com - The Walt   Disney   Company (NYSE:DIS) on Tuesday reported fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analysts’ expectations as efforts to integrate the businesses of Twenty-First Century Fox weighed on performance. 
The firm reported earnings per share of $1.35 on revenue of $20.25 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast earnings per share of $1.72 on revenue of $21.46 billion. That compared to earnings per share of $1.87 on revenue of $15.23 billion in the same period a year earlier. The company had reported earnings per share of $1.61 on revenue of $14.92 billion in the previous quarter.
The earnings miss was blamed on the loss from the 21 Century Fox businesses and lower TV/SVOD and home entertainment distribution results at the company's legacy operations. Disney acquired Twenty-First Century Fox in March this year.
""Our third-quarter results reflect our efforts to effectively integrate the 21st Century Fox assets to enhance and advance our strategic transformation,"" Disney said in a statement. 
Studio entertainment revenues for the quarter increased 33% to $3.8 billion and segment operating income increased 13% to $792 million, led by strong box office performances, the company said. 
""The increase in theatrical distribution results was due to the performance of Avengers: Endgame, Aladdin, Captain Marvel and Toy Story 4 in the current quarter compared to Avengers: Infinity War, Incredibles 2, Black Panther and Solo: A Star Wars Story in the prior-year quarter,"" Disney added. 
Its cable networks saw revenues increase 24% to $4.5 billion and operating income rise 15% to $1.6 billion, underpinned by higher income from ESPN thanks to higher advertising and affiliate revenue. Broadcasting revenues for the quarter increased 16% to $2.2 billion and operating income decreased 17% to $307 million.
The parks, experiences and products division, meanwhile, saw revenues for the quarter increased 7% to $6.6 billion and segment operating income increased 4% to $1.7 billion, which the company attributed to increases at its consumer products businesses and Disneyland Paris, though this was partially offset by a decrease at its domestic parks and resorts.

708,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",The Fast Money Was Just Getting Bullish Before It Got Burned,"(Bloomberg) -- Speculative traders were finally warming up to this year’s sizzling stock rally. Then they got burned.
A slew of hedge funds and speculative quants are in the throes of unwinding bullish trades built at the start of summer, after the intensifying U.S.-China trade war sparked one of the fastest routs in the decade-long bull market.
Volatility-targeting funds will sell about $50 billion of U.S. equities over the two sessions through Wednesday, while trend followers may unload another $15 billion, according to Pravit Chintawongvanich at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. Leverage to American stocks among both breeds of trader reached the highest since late 2018 on the eve of the recent mayhem, according to the strategist’s estimates.
Selling by systematic investors, a deterioration in fundamentals and seasonal factors could be laying the ground for a broad retreat, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.
“We would expect any near-term rally to be no more than a head fake -- and think that any such rally would be best treated as an opportunity to sell in preparation for the second wave of volatility,” wrote Masanari Takada, a quantitative strategist at the bank.
It’s the nature of this year’s stock market: Swings between panic and euphoria on the tip of a presidential tweet, wreaking havoc on buy and sell signals tracked by quants of all stripes.
The S&P 500 rose 0.3% in early trading on Tuesday as China stabilized its currency, offering some respite after Beijing retaliated against U.S. plans to expand tariffs.
Risk-control strategies allocate exposures in line with price swings, while trend-following quants -- known as commodity trading advisers -- track momentum. As such, some selling is inevitable by design after the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, rose Monday to the highest since January.
If markets remain rocky, Takada at Nomura estimates risk-parity funds could sell as much as $20 billion of developed-market shares in total this month while buying an equal amount of investment-grade bonds when they re-balance at the end of August.
 Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) warned Friday that systematic traders may dump more than $70 billion of shares in the coming weeks should equity turbulence persist.
Still, tracking pots of fast money on Wall Street is far from straightforward, given wide-ranging strategies and inputs. While hedge funds may have boosted stock bets over the summer, one gauge of exposures shows still-muted positioning, based on estimates of returns attributable to the benchmark, or beta.
As for commodity trading advisers, a similar measure shows exposures to U.S. shares reached the highest in almost 18 months in early July -- before sharply plunging.
Beyond quants and hedge funds, equity funds have lost $152 billion this year, while bond products have amassed $278 billion of inflows, according to a Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). report citing EPFR Global data. It’s a sign that discretionary positioning overall remains far from aggressive.
Even as a key breed of quantitative investor offloads billions this week, Wells Fargo’s Chintawongvanich stresses there’s no need to panic.
“Although this is a significant amount, it does not necessarily spell doom for equities in the next two days,” he wrote in a note, referring to the $50 billion that he estimates may be sold by volatility-linked funds. “Volatility has jumped so much, there is now a higher bar to further de-risking.”"

Years of unprofitable milk prices have caused so many small dairies to go bust in recent months that the market has finally turned around. Milk prices have been trending higher, and that’s great for the farmers who are left standing. But the steep inflation in milk prices caught Dean Foods off guard.
Raw-milk costs were up 12% in the company’s second quarter from a year ago, and inflation will continue. In the third quarter, Dean’s costs will rise 19%, “significantly higher than we had originally anticipated,” said Chief Financial Officer Jody Macedonio. The company reported a wider-than-expected loss that sent its shares and bonds plunging.
“Milk prices are still high because we continue to see farm consolidation and the herd size is down aggressively,” said Alyssa Badger, director of operations at HighGround Dairy in Chicago. “Production growth has halted and been very muted through the spring,” which is when cows in the U.S. are typically flush with milk.
Benchmark futures for the type of milk used to make cheese touched $17.91 per hundredweight on Tuesday. Bigger dairies, which have recently bought out many of the smaller ones, can break even at around $14, Badger said.
The ice-cream industry was another casualty of the cold, rainy weather in the U.S. spring and early summer, along with the corn farmers that delayed planting and meat companies that lost out on grilling business.
Dean Foods said it saw negative impacts to its ice cream business, similar to its competitors. Ice cream on the shelves at grocery stores also suffered, Badger said.
In addition to the steep cost increases for raw materials, Macedonio said the company also saw retail milk sales decline at a faster pace.
While the trend has been for sales to shrink around 2% a year in recent years, in Dean’s second quarter, the pace accelerated, even amid retail prices that are at historic lows compared to costs, she said. This further chipped away at the volumes of milk Dean is able to sell.
“The category is currently undergoing significant changes,” as consumers are bombarded with non-milk beverage options, she said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped more than 1 percent on Tuesday, bouncing back from a sharp sell-off the previous day as China stepped in to stabilize the yuan, easing concerns that currencies would be the next weapon in the U.S.-China trade war.
China's overnight intervention came after the U.S. Treasury Department labeled Beijing a currency manipulator as it let the yuan slide to a more than decade low on Monday.
""It's a signal from the Chinese side that they want to keep the yuan steady and elevated. But it also indicates how quickly things can change. That's permeating the tone in the market, and it's one of the reasons there remains that sense of trepidation,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
The gains came a day after U.S. stocks' biggest percentage drop of the year and a sharp fall in the Chinese currency.
China's move to fix the yuan at a slightly stronger rate and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow's comment that President Donald Trump was planning to host a Chinese delegation for talks in September allayed fears of a further escalation in the trade war.
The S&P technology index (SPLRCT), which includes companies that have a big exposure to China and were at the heart of Monday's sell-off, provided the biggest boost to the S&P index, rising 1.61%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 311.78 points, or 1.21%, to 26,029.52, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 37.03 points, or 1.30%, to 2,881.77 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 107.23 points, or 1.39%, to 7,833.27.
The S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (IXIC) each snapped a six-day losing streak. Stocks had been reeling from last week's shock when Trump vowed to slap a 10% tariff on a further $300 billion in imports from China.
After the bell, shares of Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) fell 2.6% following the release of its quarterly results. 
During the regular session, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) gained 1.9% after recent heavy losses, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) edged 1.28% higher.
Among other stocks,  Take-Two Interactive  Software Inc (O:TTWO) jumped 8.0% after the videogame publisher raised its full-year revenue forecast.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.85-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and 24 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 198 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.93 billion shares, compared with the 6.91 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The spread between U.S. shorter- and longer-dated Treasury yields contracted on Tuesday, as shorter-dated yields rose on $38 billion in three-year debt supply and nagging worries about U.S.-China trade tensions pushed down longer-dated yields.
The modest bounce among most U.S. yields followed four straight sessions of torrid declines as investors rushed into U.S. government debt to shield their money from stocks and other risky assets in response to rising trade friction between China and the United States and bets on more stimulus from global central banks to combat slowing business activity.
""The yield curve is pricing in additional accommodation from the Fed given the confluence of factors including trade,"" said Steve Johnson, senior portfolio manager at SVB Asset Management in San Francisco. ""It's a more gloomy scenario.""
Risks from trade conflicts between the United States and other countries led Fed policymakers to lower rates for the first time since 2008 last week.
On Tuesday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard made the case trade risks may stick around for a long time and said more monetary stimulus ""may be desirable.""
Interest rates futures implied traders fully positioned for the Fed to cut rates by at least a quarter-point at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, CME Group's FedWatch program showed.

Worries about a weakening global economy have stoked demand for Treasuries since last week and supported bids at the $38 billion auction of three-year notes which were sold at the lowest yield in two years.
The Treasury Department will sell $27 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday and $19 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday.
Of the $84 billion raised at this week's refunding, the Treasury intends to use the $57.3 billion raised to repay bondholders and the rest to fund new spending.
Record negative yields in Europe and Japan have also pushed U.S. yields lower as foreign investors seek bonds that offer income.
""Yields in the U.S. in the global picture still look attractive,"" Johnson said. ""Positive yields have become scarcer.""

In late U.S. trading, benchmark 10-year yields were down 0.8 basis point at 1.728%. They touched 1.672% overnight, marking their lowest level since Oct. 5, 2016.
The two-year yield (US2YT=RR), which is sensitive to traders' view on Fed policy, was up 1.8 basis points at 1.601% after hitting 1.529%, which was its lowest level since October 2017.
The two-to-10-year part of the yield curve had narrowed to 11 basis points before finishing at 12.5 basis points, 1 basis point flatter on the day.
Some selling in U.S. bonds emerged earlier Tuesday as investor fears were held in check after China kept its currency in a slightly stronger level a day after it let the yuan weaken to seven to a dollar, a level not seen in a decade.
Late Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin designated China a currency manipulator, kicking off a formal process of bilateral negotiations between the world's two largest economies."

The company also inked a new partnership with delivery company GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB).
Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) shares were up 16.3% at 2:01 p.m. ET (18:02 GMT) after hitting a 52-week high of $84.96 earlier in Tuesday's session. The shares are up nearly 88% this year.
For full-year 2019, the company guided revenue in the range of $585 to $590 million, up from its prior guidance of $576 to $582 million, but below estimates of $591.5 million. Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) sales growth is forecasted to grow about 2%, compared with estimates of 2.2% growth.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The fight between brokers and exchanges around fees and access to trading information has moved from stock exchange floors to data center rooftops.
A move by the New York Stock Exchange to install microwave equipment on the roof of its data center to speed up data transmissions is ""anti-competitive"" and could result in higher trading costs, trading firm Virtu Financial (O:VIRT) said in a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Virtu opposed the NYSE's plan because it would allow only one wireless provider - chosen by the exchange - to locate an antenna on the rooftop of the exchange operator's Mahwah, New Jersey, data center, due to ""resource and engineering constraints,"" according to the letter, which was posted to the SEC's website on July 25.
NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), declined to comment, as did the SEC.
Microwaves carry data more quickly than fiber optic cables, allowing firms that use high-frequency trading strategies, including Virtu, to complete algorithm-driven trades at close to light speed.
If its plan goes forward, it could effectively give NYSE a monopoly over access to the fastest data, allowing it to charge exorbitant fees for access to its antenna, while shutting out potentially lower-cost wireless providers, Virtu said.
Just as NYSE would never have been allowed to sell space on its exchange floor at a premium price that advantaged one member over others, neither should it be allowed to do the same with rooftop access, Virtu argued.
""The reality is that the new 'floor' of the NYSE is actually now located on the roof of a nondescript data center in Mahwah,"" Virtu said.
The disagreement is part of an ongoing dispute over the cost of market data, with Virtu, one of the world's largest trading and market-making firms, one of the most vocal critics.
Market data, including bids, asks and last sale prices, is essential to trading, but is also one of the biggest revenue sources for many exchanges.
Last year the SEC put a wide swath of exchange fees under review as part of a broader effort to improve transparency around exchange pricing. In May the regulator also released guidance telling exchanges to improve justification of their fees or continue to have them temporarily suspended and reviewed.
Virtu is also one of nine founding members of the Members Exchange, a low-cost bourse being built to challenge NYSE and Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ)."

723,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 01:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Tens of thousands losing jobs as India's auto crisis deepens - sources,"By Sudarshan Varadhan, Aditi Shah and Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Slumping sales of cars and motorcycles are triggering massive job cuts in India's auto sector, with many companies forced to shut down factories for days and axe shifts, multiple sources said.
The cull has been so extensive that one senior industry source told Reuters that initial estimates suggest that automakers, parts manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since April. 
Within this previously unreported figure, car and motorcycle makers have laid off 15,000 and component manufacturers 100,000, with the remaining job losses at dealers, many of which have closed, the industry source said. 
Reuters was able to identify at least five companies that have recently cut or plan to cut hundreds of jobs, mainly from their temporary labor force. 
The downturn - regarded by industry executives as the worst suffered by the Indian auto industry - is posing a big challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as it begins its second term at a time when India's jobless numbers are climbing. 
To revive the sector, auto executives plan to demand tax cuts and easier access to financing for both dealers and consumers at a meeting with officials from India's finance ministry scheduled for Wednesday, the senior industry source said.
The industry's plight was highlighted by the Automotive Component Manufactures Association of India (ACMA), with the trade body's director general, Vinnie Mehta, saying the sector was experiencing a ""recessionary phase"".
SPREADING MALAISE
The malaise has been spreading across much of the industry, both in terms of vehicle type and components as well as geographically in India's manufacturing hubs.
For example, Japanese motorcycle maker Yamaha Motor (T:7272) and auto components makers including France's  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Subros (NS:SUBR) have laid off about 1,700 temporary workers in India after a slump in sales, sources told Reuters.
Subros, which is part-owned by Japan's Denso Corp (T:6902) and Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269), has laid off 800 workers. Indian parts maker Vee Gee Kaushiko has cut 500 people while Yamaha and Valeo last month reduced their workforces by 200 each, said several sources aware of the cuts. 
Meanwhile, automotive supplier Wheels India (NS:WHEL) could cut its temporary workforce by as much as 800 and has started realigning its shifts, two of the sources said.
The layoffs come as carmakers including Honda Motor Co (T:7267), Tata Motors (NS:TAMO) and Mahindra & Mahindra (NS:MAHM) have implemented brief suspensions to production in recent weeks in the face of slow demand, separate sources said.
The auto sector, which contributes more than 7% of India's GDP, is facing one of its worst downturns. 
Passenger vehicle sales have dropped for nine straight months through July, with some automakers suffering year-on-year declines of more than 30 percent in recent months.
Manpower is the only variable factor for companies and more workers will face the axe, said ACMA's Mehta.
Yamaha, Subros, Vee Gee Kaushiko and Wheels India did not respond to requests for comment. 
Valeo India said it is realigning for changing conditions and has trimmed its temporary workforce.
HUGE FALLOUT
The fallout from the auto slump could be huge. The sector employs more than 35 million people directly and indirectly, accounting for nearly half of India's manufacturing output. 
India's jobless rate rose to 7.51% in July 2019 from 5.66% a year earlier, according to private data group CMIE. The CMIE data is more up-to-date than government figures and regarded in financial markets as more credible.
At least 7% of temporary workers employed by 15 automakers in India have lost their jobs in recent months, said Vishnu Mathur, director general at the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
""It is a conservative estimate based on our initial analysis,"" he said.
Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI), India's biggest carmaker, cut its temporary workforce by 6% over the past six months, Reuters reported on Friday.
There is little sign of a revival. 
Tata Motors has had week-long shutdowns at four of its plants in the past two weeks, while Mahindra has said it had 5-13 days without production at various plants between April and June.
A statement from Tata Motors said it has aligned production with demand and adjusted the shifts and temporary workers.
Honda has stopped production of some car models at its plant in the northwestern state of Rajasthan since July 16 and is halting manufacturing entirely at its second plant in Greater Noida on the outskirts of Delhi for 15 days from July 26, two sources said.

The company's Indian business said that production management will be critical throughout the year and it is seeking to avoid stock build-up.

The acquisition includes the clearing and instant payment services, and e-billing solutions of Nets' corporate services business.
Growth in payment systems has kept deals rolling, even as merger moves in other sectors have stalled on concerns over trade tensions and a global economic slowdown.
The acquisition will be complementary to Mastercard Send and Transfast technologies that deliver cross-border payments to bank accounts, mobile wallets and cards, Mastercard said.
The financial technology sector is consolidating fast, with global payments set to reach $3 trillion a year in revenue by 2023 as more people switch from cash to digital payments for online and high street sales, consulting firm McKinsey predicted.

The deal will be dilutive for up to 24 months after the deal's closing, which is expected in the first half of 2020, Mastercard said.

PARIS/MUNICH (Reuters) - Airbus is poised to open a new assembly line for the A321neo in Toulouse, France, easing a grip on production of the hot-selling jetliner enjoyed by workers in Germany and accelerating an industrial rethink caused by the demise of the much larger A380.
A formal decision on how to meet record demand for the medium-haul A321 has not been taken and operations in China and the United States are also being considered as part of an A321 study that Airbus says it will complete this year.
But industry sources say Toulouse is all but certain to get the ninth A320-family assembly line because of shorter lead times and the availability of cavernous halls built for the A380 superjumbo, which Airbus is shutting down due to weak demand.
""Toulouse is clear front-runner,"" a person familiar with the plans said, while another said Airbus had been close to announcing the move at the end of the July, when it instead said only that it was considering how to shape future A321 output.
Airbus declined comment on locations.
""We see a need to adapt our assembly capacity to reflect our richer A321 mix within the A320 family from 2022 onwards,"" Chief Operating Officer Michael Schoellhorn told Reuters by email.
The 180-240-seat A321 is the longest version of Airbus's medium-haul A320 family which competes with Boeing's 737 in the busiest part of the jet market, worth $3 trillion over 20 years.
The percentage of A321 deliveries within Airbus single-aisle output has trebled since the start of the century to 16 percent and Airbus hopes to lift that to 50 percent - part of a battle with Boeing (NYSE:BA) for the lucrative ""middle"" of the jet market.
Responsibility for building the jet lies in Hamburg, which has been struggling to implement a complex new ""Airbus Cabin Flex"" (ACF) version offering airlines multiple layouts.
Pressure on Airbus to get things back on track was highlighted on Friday when the chief executive of British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) called recent delivery delays ""unacceptable"".
IAG defected to Boeing medium-haul jets with a draft order for 200 of the grounded 737 MAX last month.
Although a new robot-assisted A321 line opened in Hamburg last year, challenges remain: more hours are needed to build the ACF version, aerospace demand has created a skills shortage in northern Germany and engineers have not navigated the ""learning-curve"" - cutting time and costs - to the planned schedule.
The new line in Toulouse would not lead to an immediate increase in overall A320-family output, but would allow Airbus to speed the introduction of new technology as the focus of its rivalry with Boeing shifts from new orders to the factory floor.
It would not lead to any job cuts in Hamburg whose plants have been growing, with 950 new jobs added recently, but instead allocate some of the anticipated future growth to Toulouse.
FRANCO-GERMAN AGREEMENTS
However, experts say it means reopening sensitive agreements over jobs between minority shareholders France and Germany.
While Airbus's biggest plants are in Toulouse, it placed the A321 at its second-largest site in Hamburg three decades ago in exchange for keeping most wide-body work in France. The pact was renewed when the long-haul A350 was placed in Toulouse, with Hamburg promised leadership over the A320 family's successor.
But Germany was forced to wait as the success of upgrades like the A321neo delayed plans for an all-new medium-haul jet.
This year's decision to close the A380 - on which Hamburg has significant work - has added another sore point, though Berlin acknowledges that Airbus has added other jobs there.
""For the federal government the main importance is that Airbus decisions about locations are a matter of competitiveness and not of political deliberations,"" said Thomas Jarzombek, aerospace coordinator for the German government.
""Should we have the impression that other countries pursue different targets, we would oppose that. We are convinced of the strength of our sites,"" he told Reuters.
Under the plan, Hamburg will have control of the promising new A321XLR, launched at last month's Paris Airshow, and retain overall leadership of the current generation of single aisles.
Berlin could use the changes as leverage to boost its claim for control of the next generation of single-aisle jets - though analysts say Airbus will be reluctant to make firm commitments beyond promising that it will be a business decision.
""For Germany it is important where the next single-aisle Airbus will be developed and built. We want the center of gravity to be again in Germany, i.e. Hamburg,"" Jarzombek said.
Switching A380 infrastructure to smaller jets could attract scrutiny from the United States which has accused Airbus of getting subsidies whose benefits did not die with the A380.
The United States and European Union have argued over whether Airbus has room to expand in Hamburg during a 15-year-old subsidy dispute in which their lawyers even spent time debating whether the ""city of bridges"" is surrounded by water.
Both sides have threatened to impose tariffs after partial victories at the World Trade Organization in the broad dispute."

LONDON (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange is poised to extend its closing open-outcry trading sessions for all metals after volumes jumped in a three-month trial, denting expectations of an eventual move to full electronic trading.
The 142-year-old LME achieved an increase in trading during closing rings in its three-month trial with zinc and is expected to announce next week that open-outcry trading for all metals will be doubled to 10 minutes each in closing rings, said a source with direct knowledge of the change.
The LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388), declined to comment ahead of a members' notice on the topic.
During the three-month trial with zinc, closing ring volumes increased by as much as 40%, industry sources said.
Overall LME trading levels have declined this year, with first-half volume down 7.2% at 88.6 million lots, LME data shows.
Analysts say that investment funds have been wary of buying industrial metals because of a slowdown in top metals consumer China and trade tensions between China and the United States, the world's top two economies.
""The trial was generally good for all parties, both the members and the LME. If that's the case, that you can generate more volume, what's not to like?"" said an executive at one of LME's members.
The ring at the LME, the world's oldest and largest market for industrial metals, is the last open-outcry trading venue in Europe. In a circle of padded, red-leather seats, traders use arcane hand signals in five-minute bursts of intense trading.
The ring has its roots in the early 19th century when the Royal Exchange, the world’s first commodities market, became so crowded that metal merchants gathered at the Jerusalem coffee house on Cornhill in the City of London to conduct business.
Other exchanges have scrapped open-outcry activity and shifted to electronic trading, prompting predictions that the LME would follow suit.
""If you can increase volumes by extending rings, then it adds to the potential for greater longevity for the ring,"" the executive said.
To make room for doubled trading times in final open-outcry trading, which sets closing prices, the LME will combine the third and fourth rings of the day, the sources said, adding that the changes could be implemented as early as September.
Longer ring trading allows clients more time to place orders, react to price changes and potentially place counter orders, traders said.
When the LME makes its announcement next week, it will also release data from both the zinc trial and another one involving nickel, which tested electronic trading to set closing prices instead of open-outcry activity, one of the sources said.
The nickel trial failed to lift volumes, so there was no impetus to implement any shift to electronic closing prices, the sources said.
Timings for the new closing sessions have not been finalised, but the combined afternoon rings are likely to run from 1500 to 1535 London time using traditional five-minute trading while the new extended closing rings, or ""kerb"", would be from 1550 to 1700."

Carmakers have been forced to consider upgrading exhaust treatment systems on older cars after German cities started banning heavily polluting diesel vehicles to cut fine particulate matter and toxic nitrogen oxides.
Daimler launched a website this week to process applications for financial support, as German motor authority KBA seeks to approve an after-market kit to upgrade the exhaust systems on various Mercedes diesel passenger vehicles.
The company has offered the subsidy to customers in German regions that face potential driving bans, the carmaker said. For a factbox about possible diesel bans, click:.
The first retrofit kit for Mercedes cars with ""Euro 5"" diesel engines, including the best-selling E220 and E250 models, has been developed by Dr Pley SCR Technology, a Bavaria-based, family-owned business.
It will cost around 3,000 euros to buy and install.
German carmakers initially offered software updates and shied away from endorsing hardware retrofits, instead lobbying for customers to buy new cars with cleaner engines.
But consumer groups pressured carmakers to endorse retrofits as a more cost-effective measure.
""We have known right from the start that retrofits are feasible and have now proved this to the carmakers,"" said Thomas Steinbrueckner, head of development at Dr Pley SCR Technology."
737,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 11:02AM ET</span>",Vivendi in talks to sell 10% of Universal Music Group to Tencent,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Sudip Kar-Gupta and Pei Li
PARIS/BEIJING (Reuters) -  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) is in talks to sell up to 20% of Universal Music Group (UMG) to Tencent, valuing its prized asset at around 30 billion euros ($34 billion), as both firms look outside their core regions to expand in a recovering global music market.
While at a preliminary stage, the discussions highlight Tencent's (HK:0700) role as gatekeeper to China's growing but tightly-controlled music market and the desire of Universal, whose revenues are surging as a result of online streaming, to expand beyond its traditional markets.
Global music-streaming retail sales are expected to more than double to $45.3 billion by 2026 from $19.6 billion in 2018, UK-based media analysis firm Midea predicts.
French media group Vivendi, controlled by billionaire Vincent Bollore, said on Tuesday that Tencent would first buy 10% of Universal, the world's biggest music label ahead of Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music and home to artists such as Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Drake and Kendrick Lamar.
Tencent, which already holds stakes in the world's most popular music streaming service, Sweden's Spotify (N:SPOT), and India's Gaana, as well as owning Joox, the biggest music streaming app in many major Asian markets, would also have an option to buy a further 10% of Universal.
Both groups are also ""considering areas of strategic commercial cooperation"", Vivendi said, raising questions among analysts over the scope of the talks and whether the French media group's main goal was to appease investors by telling them its planned sale of part of Universal was progressing. 
Universal's rivals Sony Music and Warner Music also have investments in Tencent's music division  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (TME), which China's biggest gaming and social media firm listed in 2018.
""It is unclear if the stake sale depends on the parallel commercial deal with TME (N:TME) and what economic transfers this deal involves,"" said Jerry Dellis, an analyst at Jefferies.
Dellis also said in a note to clients that U.S. political opposition to Chinese investment in what could be considered a strategic asset could obstruct a deal.
CHINESE PAYWALL 
A deal with Tencent could boost Universal's presence and fit well with TME, which tends to outbid its local competitors in acquiring music copy rights in mainland China.
It would build on the initial partnership struck two years ago between the two companies, under which Tencent can license Universal's music for distribution over its streaming platforms. 
Tencent's music unit also owns exclusive rights to sub-license Universal's content to other content providers in China. They worked together to build Abbey Road Studios, China, a recording studio named after the Beatles' studio in London. 
Universal still generates the bulk of its revenues out of the North America and Europe, which together represented more than three quarters of the division's recorded music sales in the first half, while Asia produced only 14%.
Recorded music revenues, however, grew twice as fast in Asia at 35% as in Europe at 15% over the period and TME boasted 654 million monthly active users on its platforms subscribers at the end of the first quarter. 
Spotify's monthly active users, which include its ad-supported free version, amounted to 232 million at end of June. 
After a cash-burning competition to snap up music rights, China's content regulator last year demanded music streaming sites share 99% of their rights reserve with each other.
Unlike Western players such as Sweden's Spotify, Tencent Music generates only a fraction of revenue from music subscription packages, and instead relies heavily on services popular in China such as online karaoke and live streaming. 
Universal and Tencent both hold shares in Spotify (K:SPOT), the world's biggest music streaming platform which has a market capitalization of about $27 billion, while the Swedish firm is a stakeholder in Tencent Music.
Tencent said at the time of its last earnings that it was adding more music behind a paywall, including popular Taiwanese singer Jay Chou, to raise revenue. But it said it might take time before Chinese users adapt to this relatively new approach.
STAKE SALE 
Vivendi shares surged 7% as analysts welcomed progress on the sale of a stake in Universal and the implied valuation.
""The valuation looks good, and the progress made on the UMG deal is also positive,"" said Gregory Moore, fund manager at Keren Finance, which owns Vivendi shares.
Meanwhile Tencent, whose shares closed 1% lower in Hong Kong, after Vivendi's announcement, declined to comment.
Vivendi's Chief Executive Arnaud de Puyfontaine said last month that proceeds of the sale of up to 50% of Universal would be used for bolt-on acquisitions and share buybacks. 
The group first said it would sell part of Universal a year ago but had made little progress until announcing last month that it had selected investment banks to start a formal sale, which should be finalised by the start of 2020.
Investment banks have estimated the business is worth anything between 17 billion to 44 billion euros. 
Vivendi also said that it was continuing the process to sell further minority stakes in Universal to other partners.

Financial firms are being sounded on top of potential industrial partners, a source close to the matter said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Authorities in New Delhi have rejected a plea by  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) to temporarily lift a 3-year ban while it hears the global brewer's appeal, a senior government source told Reuters.
AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, has been barred from selling its products in the critical New Delhi market for allegedly evading local taxes, Reuters reported last week. The company has denied the allegations.
A three-year investigation by authorities in India's capital found that SABMiller (LON:SAB) - acquired by AB InBev in 2016 for around $100 billion - used duplicate barcodes on beer bottles supplied to retailers that year, allowing it to pay lower levies.
AB InBev has appealed against the ban to the Commissioner of Excise in the Delhi city government, two government sources with direct knowledge said. The ban order was passed by a deputy commissioner of the division.
While the company's appeal is still under consideration, AB InBev also filed a separate plea with the Commissioner for putting the ban order on hold pending appeal, but that request was turned down, one of the government sources said on Tuesday.
""The (ban) order was detailed, there was no ground to give an interim stay,"" said the official, who declined to be named as the decision is not public.
AB InBev, which counts popular beer brands such as Budweiser, Hoegaarden and Stella Artois in its portfolio, said the city's allegations dated back to 2016 before its takeover of SABMiller and it looked forward to receiving a ""fair hearing"".
""We are strongly committed to operating with integrity and high ethical standards and making the City of Delhi part of our larger growth story in India,"" it said in a statement.
In recent weeks, AB InBev's senior executives, including vice president for legal & corporate affairs for South Asia, John K. Johnson, appeared before the Delhi officials who are hearing the company's appeal, the second government source and a third person familiar with the matter said.
AB InBev is the second biggest player in India's $7 billion beer market, accounting for a 17.5 percent market share, according to research firm IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.
The New Delhi case was sparked by a random inspection of beer bottles at a drinking spot in an upmarket New Delhi neighborhood in 2016.
The order, issued on July 16, said it was ""reasonable to believe"" same barcodes were duplicated multiple times and supplied to various retail vendors in Delhi, amounting to the offence of selling non-duty paid liquor."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - For-profit school chain Adtalem Global Education Inc (N:ATGE) has put its assets in Brazil up for sale, including flagship university Ibmec, four sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Adtalem's Brazilian assets are likely to fetch at least 2 billion reais ($505 million), two of the sources said. Adtalem Global Education has a 97.9% stake in Adtalem Brazil.
The company runs 15 schools in Brazil under three brands, with nearly 82,000 students: Wyden Educational, Ibmec and Damasio.
The education company's Brazilian operation posted revenue of $50 million in the first quarter, down 15.5% from a year before, mainly due to a decrease in value of the Brazilian currency. Still, new student enrollment increased 17.7%, mainly driven by demand for online courses and business-oriented school Ibmec.
In its first-quarter results, Adtalem said in a filing that the Brazilian economy ""presented challenges for enrollment growth and created pricing pressures in the education sector."" It offered discounts for students to compensate for delays and cuts in a federal student loan fund known as Fies.
Adtalem is in talks with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to hire its investment banking unit as an adviser on the deal, the sources added. Neither Adtalem nor Morgan Stanley replied immediately to requests for comment.
Some of the sources said Adtalem would attract more interest from buyers if it broke up its Brazilian operations, as the three businesses are very different. But two of the people said Adtalem intends to sell its Brazilian units in a single block.
The company has been revising its global strategy, currently focused on three areas: medical and healthcare, professional education and technology and business.
In December, Adtalem sold U.S. schools DeVry University, Keller Graduate School of Management and Carrington College, while keeping medical and healthcare schools it owns in the United States."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - HSBC's (L:HSBA) Swiss private banking arm has agreed to pay nearly 300 million euros ($336 million) to settle a tax fraud case in Belgium, Belgian prosecutors said on Tuesday, the latest blow for the Alpine state's banking sector from the EU.
The settlement comes after a French court in February ordered UBS (S:UBSG), another Swiss lender, to pay 4.5 billion euros in penalties for illegally soliciting clients and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion.
UBS, which is under investigation in Belgium for a similar case, denies the charges.
Swiss banks have been exposed to such legal challenges since 2004, when Bern agreed to apply a European Union tax on the savings income of its lenders' EU clients.
The Belgian prosecutors said in a statement that HSBC was ""charged by a prosecutor in 2014 for serious and organized tax fraud, forgery and falsification of records, money-laundering and illegal use of financial intermediaries.""
They alleged that HSBC helped and encouraged the avoidance of the EU savings tax by creating off-shore companies in Panama and other tax havens in the Caribbean for wealthy Belgian clients ""with no other purpose but to hide money"".
A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment.
The prosecutors also said that the bank had made and committed to a significant overhaul of its practices to counter financial crime risks following the allegations.
European Union governments have stepped up their pressure on banks and tax havens in recent years after a string of media revelations, including of the so-called Panama Papers, exposed tax avoidance and evasion schemes that helped the wealthy to avoid paying taxes in the bloc. 
The Belgian prosecutors said that under the settlement, which needs to be endorsed by Belgian judges, HSBC had agreed to pay 294.4 million euros to the Belgian state for losses in tax revenues caused by the alleged illegal activities carried out by the bank since 2013.
The prosecutors estimated that money transferred to these financial vehicles could amount to several billions of dollars.
More than a thousand Belgian taxpayers could have used the illegal schemes set up by HSBC, prosecutors said, which also said the bank was mostly serving clients active in the Antwerp diamond business.

In addition to the tax fraud, the prosecutors' statement said part of the illegal transfers could have involved money laundering without providing further details.

The tablet version of its diabetes drug, known as semaglutide, is an important growth prospect for the Danish drugmaker, which faces pressure on prices from competitors and U.S. lawmakers, who have been critical of rising drug costs.
Novo, the world's biggest producer of diabetes drugs, said the new plant near Durham would receive shipments of the active pharmaceutical ingredient needed to produce the pill from another factory under construction in North Carolina.
""We want to build manufacturing capacity in the United States so that we can establish a local U.S. supply chain for oral semaglutide and other future oral products,"" Novo Nordisk vice president Henrik Steen Jensen told Reuters.
Novo submitted its oral semaglutide drug for approval in the United States in March and hopes to begin local production in 2021, Jensen said.
The tablet, which Novo currently produces only in Denmark, belongs to a blockbuster class of treatments known as GLP-1s that stimulate insulin production.
So far, all have been via injection and a pill would make it quicker and easier for diabetics to take their medication.
Novo said it bought the plant in Durham from Purdue Pharma but did not disclose the price or capacity."

The preliminary agreement in Belgium’s largest criminal settlement still needs to be approved by a judge at a hearing that should take place in September, Willemien Baert, a spokeswoman at the Brussels prosecutors’ office, said by phone. HSBC declined to comment on the proposed settlement.
Authorities in Belgium and France began scrutinizing HSBC’s Swiss private bank after Herve Falciani, a former information technology worker at the firm, stole client account details from the Geneva office in 2008 and shared them with investigators. The French case culminated with HSBC agreeing to settle for 300 million euros.
In Belgium, the Swiss private banking unit was charged in 2014 over money-laundering allegations by investigative judge Michel Claise. Brussels prosecutors said at the time they suspected HSBC of selling offshore companies in Panama and the Virgin Islands to certain clients, aiming to avoid taxes.
Prosecutors said in a statement that they opted for a settlement to gain time after noting HSBC’s efforts to improve compliance and stop offering certain banking services as well as the lender’s willingness to pay 400,000 euros upfront.
Belgian newspaper L’Echo reported earlier Tuesday that bank had agreed on a settlement of some 300 million euros."

LONDON (Reuters) - A rout in global markets eased on Tuesday as China kept the yuan on a tight leash after its landmark drop past 7 to the dollar led the United States to label Beijing a currency manipulator.
The trade war between the world's top economies remained close to boiling point, but the heat was reduced enough to steady some nerves when China's central bank fixed the yuan at a slightly stronger rate (EU). 
Asian markets held losses to between 0.75% and 1.5% overnight. Some encouraging German data helped Europe gain. Futures were pointing to a 1% rebound after Wall Street suffered its heaviest fall of the year on Monday. (EU)
Safe-haven assets, including bonds, gold and currencies like the yen and Swiss franc, settled down as investors moved tentatively back into the euro, pound and some of emerging- market currencies.
The mood was still fragile, though. 
""I think the tipping point for a more prolonged negative trend (for risk assets) is quite close,"" said Hans Peterson, SEB Investment Management's head of asset allocation, referring to the trade war escalation and other risks such as Brexit.
""We have reduced both European and global equities. We still have a small overweight in EM (emerging market) stocks but just a small one.""
U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that China was manipulating its currency, and that Washington would engage the International Monetary Fund to clamp down on Beijing. 
""Officially labeling China a currency manipulator gives the United States a legitimate reason to take even more steps,"" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The markets are now scrambling to factor in the possibility of the United States imposing not only an additional 10% of tariffs on Chinese imports, but the figure being raised to 25%.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also said it no longer expects a deal to be struck before the November 2020 U.S. presidential election. Morgan Stanley said more tit-for-tat tariffs could tip the world economy into recession by the middle next year. 
Though U.S. Treasury yields had edged back up to 1.74% from October 2016 lows of 1.672%, German yields stayed down at -0.54%. Markets are now pricing in a 100% chance that the European Central Bank will cut its already negative interest rates again next month. [ECBWATCH]
YUAN TO WATCH 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) had ended down 0.75% after brushing its lowest since January. It has lost 3.7% so far this week.
The Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) retreated 1.4%, while Japan's Nikkei (N225) shed 0.7%. Australian stocks (AXJO) fell 2.4% after metals prices fell and Australia's central bank resisted cutting interest rates again.
China's offshore yuan had stretched the previous day's slide, briefly weakening to 7.1382 , the lowest since international trading in the Chinese currency began in 2010. But it pulled back to 7.0469 after Beijing's firmer-than-expected fixing on Tuesday.

755,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 06:44AM ET</span>","For J.C. Penney CEO, debt haunts turnaround bid","By Mike Spector, Jessica DiNapoli and Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc’s (N:JCP) stock has plunged more than 70% over the past year and now trades under $1. Its first-quarter financial loss nearly doubled to $154 million. 
But in newly-minted Chief Executive Officer Jill Soltau’s turnaround bid, another figure looms larger: $4 billion.
That is the rough total of a potentially crushing debt load on Penney’s balance sheet, a ticking time bomb that could derail Soltau’s attempt to revitalize the 117-year-old department store chain.
Soltau, hired late last year from craft and fabrics seller Jo-Ann Stores, is attempting to restore Penney’s roots as a retailer of mid-priced apparel for middle-class families. In the short term, she is reducing inventory at stores to boost margins on merchandise and closing underperforming outlets.
Soltau, who declined an interview request through a spokeswoman, earlier this year described Penney’s turnaround attempt as “a long road” with “no silver bullets” that “will take time.”
Penney has about $1.75 billion in liquidity in the form of cash and money available under a revolving credit line, a point Soltau has emphasized in meetings with hedge funds holding the retailer’s loans and bonds, a person familiar with the matter said. That makes Penney’s near-term debt payments manageable.
But more than $2 billion comes due in 2023, the legacy of a loan tapped six years ago after Penney replaced former CEO Ron Johnson. The onetime pioneer of Apple Inc’s (O:AAPL) retail outlets launched expensive renovations of Penney stores and eliminated coupons, sparking a customer backlash that resulted in plunging sales.
For a graphic on Penney's share price vs rivals, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2YO29Bu and for a FACTBOX.
Johnson was one of four executives who have tried to turn Penney around since 2011. Macy’s Inc (N:M), by comparison, had the same CEO since 2003 until a recent change, while  Kohls Corp  (N:KSS) recently tapped a new top executive to succeed one who had the reins since 2008. For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2YrcXds
Declining visits from shoppers have led to years of falling sales and strained cash flow at Penney, raising concerns among shareholders, creditors and vendors shipping merchandise that the company won’t be able to meet its financial obligations, even those four years away. 
The result is Penney hired advisers to explore debt restructuring options that would buy more time to forge a turnaround, Reuters reported in July. Penney subsequently confirmed hiring advisers to improve its balance sheet after investors dumped its shares, and added it was not making bankruptcy preparations.
“We weren’t surprised,"" said Levi Strauss & Co (N:LEVI) Chief Executive Officer Chip Bergh in an interview. ""We’re looking at their debt and we’re managing our credit with them appropriately.” 
Bergh has urged Penney to stock more of his company’s denim and purchase less from poorer selling brands. “They’ve got to turn their business around and put some points on the board,” he said.
Penney’s latest debt advisers include restructuring specialists from law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP and investment bank  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ), according to people familiar with the hires. 
The firms, which had no comment, have worked on significant workouts with other retailers, including on a debt restructuring earlier this year for luxury clothier Neiman Marcus Group Ltd executed without the need for a bankruptcy filing.
The advisers are not exploring a bankruptcy filing for Penney and are focused on reworking finances outside of court proceedings, one of the sources said. Penney took similar steps in 2013, leading to a new loan it has refinanced to come due in four years.
Levi’s Bergh said Penney is a “long way away” from suffering the fate of Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ), which filed for bankruptcy last year. “It’s worth pointing out that when Sears declared bankruptcy, we had negligible financial exposure because we had been managing credit in an appropriate way. We’re doing the same thing with J.C. Penney,” he said.
DEBT DILEMMA
Options under consideration for Penney include raising additional cash and negotiating with creditors to push out debt maturities, said a person familiar with the matter. Penney could also reduce liabilities and delay debt payments by offering new bonds to investors whose current holdings have declined in value as result of the retailer’s financial distress, the source said.
A Penney spokeswoman declined to comment further on the company’s advisers or future financial plans. 
Joe Shamie, president of Delta Children, which has supplied Penney with children's furniture for more than 30 years, is one of many banking on the retailer and its financial backers coming through with a long-term strategy. 
""We need them to survive. We cannot do it without their continuing to receive support and a credit line so we can supply JCP with great product and they can stock their shelves and service their customers,"" Shamie said.
SOLTAU'S STRATEGY
Soltau is attempting to buck the trend of troubled bricks-and-mortar retailers failing amid the rise of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and dominance from larger rivals such as Kohls, Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT). In addition, Penney faces fierce competition from discount retailers such as TJX Cos Inc’s (N:TJX) Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains.
She has shifted Penney’s strategic priorities to refocus on the retailer’s once-thriving and higher-margin apparel business.
The moves have contributed to near-term financial pain. Jettisoning Penney’s home appliances business and all but canceling its furniture offerings combined to hurt sales during the first three months of the year. 
Penney is revamping stores and clearing out old merchandise to make more room for certain home goods and women’s apparel. Penney also is testing a new centralized pickup and returns area expected to be rolled out in hundreds of stores, and recently started a new streamlined checkout process.
Soltau has lured Michelle Wlazlo from Target to be chief merchant and Truett Horne from consulting firm McKinsey & Co to take on a new role developing the company’s long-term strategy.
Other efforts predating Soltau include launching a big and tall men's clothing brand featuring former professional basketball star Shaquille O'Neal and a partnership with Fanatics Inc aiming to attract sports fans with the latest team apparel on store racks. FACTBOX
Still, the retailer faces longstanding challenges that stretch beyond stores. Penny's website traffic in the second quarter declined compared with rival Kohls, with stops at its homepage falling 11% and visits beyond there sinking 41.4% compared with the same period last year, according to data from analytics firm SimilarWeb.

By 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.6% at 371.58. The German Dax was up 0.7%, helped by a stabilization in factory orders in June, but the U.K. FTSE was underperforming, up only 0.1%. The Danish OMX Copenhagen 20 index led the way with a gain of 1.2%.
Markets have taken in their stride the U.S.’s decision to label China a currency manipulator, after the yuan fell through 7 to the dollar on Monday for the first time since 2008. Ironically, the move came at a time when the Chinese central bank was resisting downward pressure on the yuan, evident in the fact that the offshore yuan rate – which it does not control – fell further than the tightly managed onshore rate. The dollar held above 7 yuan in both markets Tuesday.
Among individual stocks, French entertainment group   Vivendi   (PA:VIV) was the standout performer, rising over 7% after it announced it was in talks to sell a 10% stake in Universal Music Group to China’s Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) at a price that valued UMG at 30 billion euros ($33.6 billion). The deal would include an option for Tencent to buy another 10% at the same price. Vivendi said it would continue to look for additional partners.
 Vivendi  (PA:VIV) has been looking for partners to help unlock the value in a revitalized UMG for over a year, but had consciously ruled out an IPO, fearing that public markets would never give it as generous a valuation as a trade buyer. Tencent’s opportunity lies in having a powerful platform to promote UMG’s artists in a region where they are scarcely visible. Asia as a whole accounted for less than 13% of UMG’s revenue in the first quarter.
The 30 billion euro valuation for UMG makes clear how little the market values Vivendi’s other assets, given that Vivendi itself only has a market capitalization of 32.5 billion euros. In addition to UMG, Vivendi owns France’s biggest pay TV company Canal+, a 24% stake in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (worth 2.5 billion at current market prices), advertising agency Havas and video game publisher Game Loft.
Elsewhere, U.K. fast fashion retailer boohoo.com (LON:BOOH) rose 3.4% after announcing it had struck a deal to buy the online business of Karen Millen out of administration proceedings, while Rolls Royce (LON:RR) fell 0.7% after announcing a provision for issues relating to the Trent 1000 engine. That overshadowed a rise in operating profit.   Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA   (OL:NWC) fell over 8% amid continuing fears for its outlook after a lukewarm monthly traffic update."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India Inc has turned in its most disappointing quarterly numbers in at least three years and analysts warn hopes for any festive season cheer are likely to be dashed by a slowing economy.
More than 60% of 125 firms that have reported so far, and are tracked by analysts, missed profit forecasts for the June quarter, the most since at least 2016, Refinitiv data shows.
India's biggest lenders and automakers have all sounded warning bells over the slower growth in demand and consumption.
""It's going to be a gloomy Diwali. Things are not going to change immediately in the next two or three months,"" said Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities.
(Graphic: India Inc Q1 Performance - https://tmsnrt.rs/336POeM)
The Indian festive season, which starts in September and runs through the end of the year, is the biggest sales season for companies. It typically peaks around Diwali, or the festival of lights, in October. 
But this time, the outlook for the period is subdued after India's economy grew at the slowest pace in more than four years in the January-March quarter. An erratic monsoon, high rates of unemployment and a liquidity crisis in the shadow banking sector have added to the uncertainty.
""Consumers are currently postponing their purchases because of the general slowdown,"" said Neeraj Dewan, director, Quantum Securities.
Consumer goods giant  Hindustan Unilever  (NS:HLL) has warned demand will ""remain subdued given macroeconomic conditions"".
The benchmark Nifty index (NSEI) has dropped more than 10% since hitting an all-time high in early June and is the fourth-worst performer among its major Asian peers so far this year.
""The growth engine is slowing down, which is why we are seeing a sell-off,"" Samco's Mehta said.
(Graphic: Asia-Pacific markets' performance 2019 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Kh65VY)
Automakers have been among the worst hit by the slump in demand, with monthly auto sales in India down 17-20% since April. Preliminary data shows overall car sales in the country may have dropped as much as 30% in July. Tata Motors (NS:TAMO), India's top automaker by revenue, posted a bigger-than-expected loss for the June quarter. Rival Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI), which managed to top estimates aided by cost cuts, saw an 18% drop in sales. 
Gopal Mahadevan, finance head at truck maker  Ashok Leyland  (NS:ASOK), has said the lower auto sales have ""more to do with the general economic condition"" and not a demand problem.
Among the few bright spots for the quarter was Johnny Walker and Smirnoff maker  Diageo  (L:DGE), which reported an 8% rise in sales in India, led by strong demand for scotch. Its subsidiary,  United Spirits  (NS:UNSP), posted a near 10% rise in sales.
""The lipstick effect, which indicates consumers spend more on low-ticket luxury and instant gratification items during a crisis, could be at play here,"" said Gnanasundaram Saminathan, a research analyst at Spark Capital Advisors.

Tensions between the United States and China intensified over the past few days, after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1.
Adding to the woes, the U.S. Treasury Department announced late on Monday that it had determined for the first time since 1994 that China was manipulating its currency. The yuan broke past the symbolic 7-per-dollar level on Monday after China let the currency slide in response to the latest U.S. tariffs.
Jefferies said these developments, including the devaluation of the yuan and tightening measures in Chinese property markets, suggested that a cyclical recovery has now been pushed back further.
Any measures to tighten lending for the real estate sector could have a major impact, as Chinese property markets account for about 15% of global demand for metals, Jefferies analysts wrote.
""A slowdown in construction and a decline in Chinese manufacturing and exports due to trade wars would be significant negatives for metals' demand, even if fiscal/monetary stimulus leads to some recovery in the broader Chinese economy,"" the brokerage said in a note.
Jefferies cut its ratings on  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Ltd, BHP Group Ltd, Fortescue Metals Group, Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal Inc to 'hold' from 'buy'. 

The brokerage now prefers copper miners over iron ore and coal miners. It reduced its 2019 price forecast for iron ore fines (CFR China) by over 10% to $88 per tonne, while that of iron ore lump (CFR China) was cut to $106 per tonne.

(Reuters) - European shares steadied on Tuesday after posting their biggest two-day drop in over 3 years, as upbeat German data soothed some of the nerves around the past week's escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions.
German industrial orders rose 2.5% in June, the biggest jump since August 2017, although the government of Europe's biggest economy said it was yet to reach a turning point after months of weakness which have worried investors. [nL8N2521BV]
Traders said the selling driven by the symbolic fall in the value of China's officially-controlled yuan currency on Monday had eased for now, but said sentiment remained shaky.
London's FTSE 100 index, packed with miners and commodity-focused firms who are heavily exposed to Chinese demand, fell another half a percent in morning trade. (FTSE)
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX), however, gained 0.06%.
""The decent increase (in German orders) in June is good news, but is no cause for immediate celebration. In view of the trade conflicts, humility is required,"" said Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank.
The export-oriented German economy, facing headwinds from trade disputes, a cooling global economy and Brexit uncertainty is still widely expected to have contracted in the second quarter.
But the orders were another sign - following robust if slowing data from the United States - that the economic weakness that has spurred a change in direction from major central banks in recent weeks may not be as bad as feared.
The German-dominated auto sector (SXAP) rose in response to the data, while media stocks (SXMP) led sub-sector gains as  Vivendi  shares (PA:VIV) jumped on news that it may sell a 10% stake in Universal Music Group to Chinese tech group Tencent (HK:0700).
Earnings in the region were mixed with shares of  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) rising nearly 3% after the German post and logistics group affirmed its guidance for the second half of 2019 and 2020. Switzerland's OC Oerlikon (S:OERL) fell 1.5% after the industrial group cut its 2019 guidance.
Shares of Germany's Metro (DE:B4B) slumped 8% after Czech businessman Daniel Kretinsky's investment vehicle confirmed it would not raise its 5.8 billion euro bid for the German retailer and wholesaler."

The yuan slid past the 7 per dollar level on Monday for the first time since 2008 amid a trade dispute with the U.S., though it has stabilized since then. While China may limit more declines to ease the impact on markets, the exchange rate will weaken again if trade talks sour, China Securities Co. said in a note dated Tuesday.
Companies that rely on foreign debt, especially by borrowing in U.S. dollars, and those whose businesses depend on Chinese consumers, will likely suffer more than others from a weaker yuan.
Airlines: Air China Ltd., China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines Co. and China Eastern Airlines Corp. had at least 21% of their total debt denominated in U.S. dollars as of end-2018, annual reports show. A weaker yuan would make repayment of that debt more expensive and push up costs as fuel and new aircraft are priced in the greenbackDevelopers: Real estate firms are also among the biggest holders of U.S. debt. They account for about 31% of total outstanding dollar bonds issued by Chinese companies aside from banks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That is the highest among all sectorsHong Kong jewelers: While gold prices are getting a boost amid risk-off sentiment -- a boon for jewelers -- a weaker yuan undermines the spending power of Chinese consumers. The mainland market contributed more than 62% of revenue to Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. last year and nearly half of sales for Chow Sang Sang Holdings International Ltd., according to data compiled by BloombergHong Kong retailers and Macau casinos: The two cities might see fewer visits from mainland Chinese people worried about currency depreciation. Sa Sa International Holdings Ltd. Chairman Simon Kwok, whose cosmetics retailer is popular with Chinese travelers, said in June that customers become more prudent when the yuan falls. The same issue could prevent both small-fry tourists and high-spending gamblers from wagering big in Macau.

766,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 04:06AM ET</span>",India's top airline IndiGo co-founder says feud still unresolved,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - A co-founder of India's biggest airline IndiGo, Rakesh Gangwal, said reports that a truce had been brokered between him and another co-founder Rahul Bhatia over disagreements on corporate governance were ""false and misleading.""
In a letter http://pdf.reuters.com/pdfnews/pdfnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u= dated Aug. 5, Gangwal told the board of IndiGo's parent InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (NS:INGL) that issues between him and Bhatia remained unresolved.
Gangwal last month alleged violations of corporate governance rules at InterGlobe, calling for India's securities regulator to intervene.
At the center of Gangwal's complaint were Bhatia-controlled IGE Group's significant controlling rights over IndiGo, which he alleged allows them to carry out ""questionable"" transactions.
In the latest letter, disclosed by InterGlobe to exchanges on Tuesday, Gangwal said he did not back a proposal by the airline to expand its board of directors to 10, arguing that it would benefit IGE and help it ""rework and dilute"" an agreed-upon policy on related-party transactions.
InterGlobe lost almost $1 billion in market value on July 10 after Gangwal disclosed his complaint to regulators, although the shares have recouped most of those losses since then.
The stock rose around 2% on July 24 after the Economic Times reported https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indigo-chairman-brokers-truce-between-promoters-bharti-and-gangwal-stock-rallies-2/articleshow/70361026.cms that InterGlobe Chairman M. Damodaran had brokered a truce between the co-founders.
Under Gangwal and Bhatia, IndiGo has grown rapidly since it launched flights in 2006 and now controls a near 50% share of the Indian domestic aviation market.
IndiGo, Asia's most valuable budget airline by market capitalization, has also accelerated international expansion plans since Jet Airways (NS:JET), once India's largest private carrier, collapsed in April."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Air China will suspend its flights on the Beijing-Hawaii route from Aug. 27 after a review of its network, China's flagship carrier said on Tuesday, as travel demand remains weak amid an escalating U.S.-China trade war.
Passengers who have purchased tickets for travel after that date will receive a full refund, Air China said in a statement on its website. 
The passenger load factor - an industry metric that measures how much of an airline's passenger carrying capacity is used - for Air China's thrice-weekly Beijing-Honolulu route averaged 66.37% last year, according to Chinese aviation data provider Variflight. 
That was well below the average load factor of 76.69% for Air China's international flights last year. 
Hong Kong-listed shares of Air China fell 3.5% on Tuesday afternoon, while its Shanghai-listed shares shed 2.8%.
Hawaiian Airlines last year pulled out of the same non-stop service between Honolulu and Beijing, which it opened in 2014, citing slower-than-expected growth in demand.
Its CEO Peter Ingram said the route was suspended due to lack of growth and not because of trade tensions with China.
The Air China announcement comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-China relations as the world's two biggest economies are locked in a year-long trade war that has disrupted global supply chains and rattled financial markets. 
Beijing in June issued a travel advisory warning Chinese tourists about the risks of traveling to the United States, citing concerns about gun violence, robberies and thefts.

The number of Chinese tourists arriving in the United States posted the first decline last year in 15 years, according to U.S. data.

Barneys secured $75 million in new financing from affiliates of Hilco Global and the Gordon Brothers Group to help it keep operating as it navigates the bankruptcy court, it said in a statement.
The retailer will close its physical stores in Chicago, Las Vegas and Seattle, along with five smaller concept stores and seven Barneys Warehouse locations.
Barneys for weeks has been searching for a buyer or an investor, grappling with a crisis due to a steep hike in rent at its Manhattan flagship store on Madison Avenue to roughly $30 million from $16 million.
That is on top of pressure from online retailers that have emerged with the rise of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and pushed an abundance of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to the financial brink, or caused them to fail altogether.
However, its Madison Avenue store will stay open along with its other four flagship locations, Barneys said.
""Barneys New York Board and management team have taken decisive action by entering into a court-supervised process, which will provide the company the necessary tools to conduct a sale process, review our current leases and optimize our operations,"" said Daniella Vitale, chief executive officer.
The New York Times reported that multiple parties, which are not department store groups, had expressed interest in the company and one of those offers fell through due to lack of time.
Barneys listed assets and liabilities in the range of $100 million to $500 million in the voluntary Chapter 11 document filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York.
Barneys was advised by investment bank Houlihan Lokey, M-III Partners, the turnaround firm founded by restructuring veteran Mohsin Meghji, and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.
Reuters reported in July that Barneys was exploring options, including filing for a bankruptcy with the assistance of law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP.
Department store operator Sears Holdings Corp, toy shop Toys ""R"" Us Inc and children's apparel retailer Gymboree Group Inc had filed for bankruptcy in roughly the past year.
Barneys filed for bankruptcy once before, in the late 1990s, and also completed a more recent debt restructuring outside of court proceedings in 2012 that handed ownership to a hedge fund run by financier Richard Perry and an investment firm founded by supermarket magnate Ron Burkle."

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's tumbling yuan steadied on Tuesday as authorities took steps to contain its slide while stocks plunged after Washington labelled Beijing a currency manipulator, marking a sharp escalation in U.S. trade tensions.
The currency has slumped 2.3% over the past three days and broken past the symbolic 7-per-dollar level, pounding stocks and pushing bonds higher as investors feared the yuan's value has become a new front in the U.S.-China trade war.
On Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Washington would designate China a currency manipulator, its first such move since 1994, sending both the onshore and offshore yuan to record lows..
The People's Bank of China's firmer-than-expected yuan fixing on Tuesday helped pull the currency away from these lows as did an announced bond sale in the offshore market, seen as signs authorities wanted to stem the rout.
""(China is) seizing the narrative on the renminbi,"" said Andy Wong, multi-asset senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management in Hong Kong.
""Rather than being pressured to signal that 7 is just a psychological level, they are ... saying this is something that we control rather than markets or whatever other pressures.""
The yuan dropped to the record low in offshore trade early in Asia, after Mnuchin's announcement, before bouncing to steady around 7.0642 per dollar.
The PBOC fixed the yuan midpoint, which sets the point around which the currency is allowed to trade, at 6.9683 per dollar, firmer than market expectations.
The PBOC's announcement of a sale of 30 billion yuan ($4.25 billion) worth of yuan-denominated bills in Hong Kong also suggested the central bank was soaking up cash to prevent speculative short-selling.
The currency opened onshore trade at 7.0699 per dollar, then firmed to 7.0515 by 0310 GMT. The offshore yuan fell to as low as 7.1397 per dollar before coming back as far as 7.0596.
However, the currency's stabilisation on Tuesday was not enough assuage markets, but did halt their slide by midsession.
The Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) fell over 2% to 2,733.92, touching its lowest level since February, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) hit it's lowest since January before paring some of the losses.
""Renminbi weakening pressure added uncertainty to the stock market and added pressure especially for financials and property companies,"" said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong
""The PBOC is sending signals that it would like to mitigate RMB depreciation – by fixing dollar/yuan somewhat low, and by announcing to issue offshore bills,"" said Frances Cheung, a strategist at Westpac.
Chinese policy sources had told Reuters that the currency was allowed to slide so markets could factor in concerns over the tussle between the world's two largest economies, especially after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs last week.
""We think the most important takeaway is the risk of U.S.-China trade war escalating further has increased,"" UBS Economist Tao Wang said in a note to clients.
""As the trade war escalates further and depreciation pressure on the renminbi intensifies, we expect the dollar/yuan to trade beyond 7 more often in the rest of the year.""

776,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 12:20AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Rebound After China’s Yuan Fix Tempers Concerns,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock-index futures rebounded, erasing earlier declines, after China’s central bank set its currency fixing stronger than expected.
S&P 500 Index futures contracts expiring in September rose as much as 0.7% as of 1:06 p.m. in Tokyo as the yuan steadied. Dow Jones Industrial Average contracts ascended 0.6% while those on the Nasdaq 100 added 0.5%.
S&P 500 futures recovered after falling as much as 1.9% after the Trump administration formally labeled China a currency manipulator. The move exacerbated trade worries after China’s central bank on Monday allowed the yuan to fall in retaliation for new U.S. tariffs.
U.S. futures gained after the People’s Bank of China set its daily reference rate at 6.9683 per dollar on Tuesday. That compared with an estimated 6.9871, according to the average of forecasts by 19 traders and analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
“As soon as 7 broke on the CNY, the obvious reaction by the Trump administration was to call China a currency manipulator,” said Nader Naeimi, AMP Capital’s head of dynamic markets in Sydney. “But I don’t know how you can call someone a currency manipulator when all they have done has been to keep the currency from depreciating.”
Naeimi said it’s possible that the market is in for a global stock selloff that’s as bad as the one seen during the fourth quarter of last year. “Seasonals are turning negative as well. We are seeing breakdowns across most market bellwethers across FX, equity and bond markets,” he said.
The S&P 500 suffered its biggest rout of the year Monday and bonds rallied as investors fretted about the escalating trade war. More than $700 billion was wiped from the value of U.S. equities, with the S&P 500 Index plunging 3% and all but 11 companies on the gauge trading lower. The Cboe Volatility Index surged about 40%."
777,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 12:15AM ET</span>",Some Wall Street workers face pay slump in 2019: report,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Many Wall Street workers will see their pay stay flat or decline this year, as big banks and money managers continue to cut costs, according to a report on Tuesday by compensation consultancy Johnson Associates.
Those in equities trading and underwriting will be hardest hit, with annual pay packages down 10-15%, Johnson Associates predicted. Bond traders and traditional asset managers can expect reductions of 0-5%, with dealmakers and private bankers facing flat pay.
The job market has generally tightened on Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis, when market chaos and recession forced the industry to adjust. But now there is a peculiar dynamic, where pay can fall even when the economy is strong, said Alan Johnson, who runs the consultancy.
""This is kind of an inflection point,"" he said. ""It used to be, 'As long as AUM is up and as long as the market is up, you'll be fine.' But that's no longer true.""
AUM refers to assets under management.
Pay is under pressure because of increased competition and automation. As an example, Johnson pointed to index funds that simply track the market but cost less and perform better than funds handled by human portfolio managers. As investors demand more for a lower price, firms have been reducing headcount and squeezing pay.
The dynamic has been showing up in some quarterly results.
Morgan Stanley's (N:MS) compensation expense for the first six months of 2019 fell 13% compared with the same period in 2018. That figure dropped 12% at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and 2% at JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) investment bank.
The Johnson Associates report is based on the firm's work with 16 major banks and asset managers that are not named.
The only areas where employees may see a pay bump this year are private equity, hedge funds and traditional lending, according to the report. Those workers could see pay rise 0-5%.
Although fewer are bringing home massive paychecks, Wall Street still rewards top performers, Johnson said. Those who create new products, maintain strong ties with clients and outsmart rivals are particularly valuable.

""Firms want to be efficient and have a motivated workforce,"" he said. ""There's a huge focus on paying the very best people.""

The move comes against the backdrop of a rapid escalation in the U.S.-China trade conflict, with Washington designating Beijing a currency manipulator and U.S. President Donald Trump vowing to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1.
A 2% percent stake in the JPMorgan China fund management JV, China International Fund Management (CIFM), changed hands on Friday in an auction at the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange, a deal post on the exchange showed.
The exchange did not identify the buyer in its filing on the day, but sources with knowledge of the matter had told Reuters JPMorgan Asset Management Co was the sole bidder.
JPMorgan held 49% of the JV before the latest deal, which still needs regulatory approval.
""We are looking forward to the next steps to proceed with this acquisition, working closely with our joint venture partners,"" Dan Watkins, Asia Pacific CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said on Tuesday.
""Once completed, the deal will be contingent on the approval of regulators in the U.S. and China.""
Under rule changes unveiled by China in 2017, foreign asset managers were allowed to own up to 51% of their Chinese mutual fund ventures. Beijing later said foreign ownership caps would be removed by 2020, a year earlier than scheduled.
The U.S. asset manager did not comment on how soon they expect to get regulatory approval, or when they will be able to start operations as a majority-owned fund manager in the world's second-largest economy."

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Composite dropped 2.7% and 2.4% respectively by 10:37 PM ET (02:37 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 2.1%. 
 
In a statement, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said overnight that the U.S. government has declared China a currency manipulator.
 
On Monday, China allowed the yuan to fall past the key 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than 10 years. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said it would ""continue to ... take necessary and targeted measures against the positive feedback behavior that may occur in the foreign exchange market.""
 
""This is an open acknowledgement by the PBOC that it has extensive experience manipulating its currency and remains prepared to do so on an ongoing basis,"" the Treasury statement said.
 
The PBOC has set the yuan fixing at 6.9683 per dollar on Tuesday morning. 
 
China also announced that it would stop buying U.S. agricultural products, one day after its state-owned media said Beijing won’t be bullied and would “fight back.” 
 
The moves came after the U.S. slapped more tariffs on Chinese goods last week.
 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 2.1% lower. Data from the labor ministry showed the country’s real wage in June fell 0.5% from a year earlier, compared with a downwardly revised 1.3% annual decline in May. 
 
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.7%.

The PBOC is issuing 20 billion yuan of three-month bills and 10 billion yuan of one-year bills.
The issuance came after China let the yuan weaken past the key 7 per dollar level amid the escalating trade war with the United States, and after Washington labeled the country a currency manipulator on Monday.
Traders say the PBOC has at times in the past used issuance in Hong Kong as a way to mop up liquidity and support offshore yuan levels.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 08:28PM ET</span>",Asset managers farm out trading as costs and complexity climb,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - It's 10 o'clock at night, and Benjamin Arnold's day is just beginning. The former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trader is gearing up to trade equities in Asia from his small office thousands of miles away in Park City, Utah.
He's not trading his own book, but rather is taking orders and executing trades for a client, an Asian asset manager.
After almost 15 years working at hedge funds and banks, Arnold launched an outsourced trading firm, joining a growing crop of niche companies aiming to tap burgeoning demand for outside help from small and mid-sized asset managers.
""There comes a time when you have to decide between standing by and watching the world change or stepping up and becoming that change,"" the 37-year-old said.
A heavier regulatory burden on money managers, razor-thin margins and rapid technological developments in trading are driving many to cut costs and hire outside firms to handle their day-to-day trading.
The pace of demand has accelerated this year in particular as asset managers feel the pinch following the introduction in 2018 of the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) which slapped more onerous paperwork on them.
It is as much as 40% cheaper for small to medium-sized fund firms to hire an external trading company than employ two traders themselves, according to interviews with executives from more than a dozen asset managers, banks and brokerages, as well as industry experts.
Michael Broadbent at Ergo Consultancy, which helps set up trading desks and advises fund managers on regulation, has seen a ""giant switch"" this year.
""It is almost impossible for an in-house trading team to stay focused on every new and opening liquidity venue, electronic broker, non-incumbent exchange and crossing network while continuing to execute their existing business to a MiFID II standard of best execution,"" he said.
The industry is still in its infancy, but industry experts say it is one of the fastest-growing segments in prime brokerage, which covers the complex financial services needs of big institutions.
They reckon about two dozen firms offer outsourced trading services with at least four, including  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC), BTON Financial and Arnold's Meraki Global Advisors, venturing into the business this year. That compares with just a handful a few years ago, they say.
Last month, mid-sized broker INTL FCStone (O:INTL) bought U.S. outsourcer Fillmore Advisors to bolster its prime brokerage offering.
The gap in the market being filled by boutique outsourcers, like Fillmore, Arnold's Meraki, Tourmaline Partners and CF Global, is prompting some big banks and brokerages to try to grab a slice of the action.
 Northern Trust  Corp (O:NTRS) and Jefferies Financial Group (N:JEF), for example, have set up their own outsourcing teams of traders working for a range of clients.
Such outsourced trading desks effectively work as units of ""buy-side"" investors like asset managers, and include all the analysis, administration and compliance services an in-house team would provide. They are distinct from a bank or brokerage's regular ""sell-side"" trading operations which simply execute trades on a client's behalf.
GROWING POPULARITY
One in every five fund firms with over $50 billion worth of assets will outsource some portion of their trading desks by 2022, according to research by financial consultancy Opimas. Global revenues in the outsourced trading business are about $450-$500 million annually and expected to grow 20-30% a year, it said.
The practice of farming out trading functions has been around for years, but it is becoming increasingly attractive for small and mid-sized asset managers who may not be trading frequently or in big enough volumes to justify the cost of maintaining an in-house desk.
Opimas estimates it works out cheaper to hire an outsourced firm if an asset manager's equities trader is handling less than $1.5 billion in annual trading volume.
""We like to stick to our knitting,"" said Karen Zachary, chief operating officer of Crux Asset Management, which uses Northern Trust to handle all its day-to-day trading so it can focus on strategy.
London-based EdenTree Investment Management, with 2.7 billion pounds ($3.28 billion) assets under management, is considering outsourcing its dealings, said one of its fund managers, Chris Hiorns.
By outsourcing, asset managers would typically spend about 5 basis points per trade, compared with the equivalent of around 8 basis points if they traded in-house, according to the market players and researchers interviewed.
Experts estimate it costs about $1.5 million per year to operate a three-member trading desk, and small to mid-sized fund firms typically employ two to three traders. Then there are the costs of reporting trades to regulators and additional compliance due to MiFID II.
Needs vary among asset managers; some like Crux hire an outside company to handle all their execution, while London-based Hermes Investment Management, for example, relies on CF Global for its emerging market and Asia ex-Japan equities, and keeps its own traders for other assets. Some use trading firms to cover inconvenient time zones like Australia.
$8 BILLION PER TRADER
For the banks and brokerages who are increasingly offering outsourced trading, it represents a much-needed source of extra income as they too have been squeezed by regulation and are grappling with perennially low interest rates.
""The sell side is facing its own challenges, as fixed costs are rising while the commission pool is shrinking,"" said Richard Johnson, a senior analyst at research firm Greenwich Associates.
""Within this dynamic, outsourced trading desks have created a strong niche and compelling value proposition.""
U.S.-based Northern Trust ventured into the business almost two years ago and now has 32 clients including Fundsmith and Mobius Capital Partners.
Gary Paulin, head of institutional brokerage at Northern Trust, said his outsourcing team of 18 traders processed equity trades worth $145 billion last year for its various clients.
That's about $8 billion per trader.
Jefferies Prime Brokerage launched its outsourced trading business in June last year, and now has 70 clients, according to John Laub, co-head of prime brokerage at Jefferies.
According to Laub, under 10% of their start-up clients were using outsourced trading in 2016, while the figure for start-up funds today is ""north of 70%"".
Aside from cost savings, outsourced trading desks also offer big broker networks, which are increasingly necessary under MiFIDII.
The rules require money managers to prove to clients they have traded in the most efficient way possible - known as ""best execution"" - piling on extra pressure as they battle competition from passive funds, which track markets rather than trying to outperform them.
""It's a really cumbersome process with around 80 reporting fields, it's a real pain and it costs money,"" said Paulin at Northern Trust.
Tourmaline Partners, for instance, says it has access to 400 brokers through its almost 40 traders in London, Stamford in the United States and Sydney, Australia.
They handled $175 billion worth of trades last year. Andrew Walton, head of its European business, said he expects that to rise by a fifth this year.
For experienced traders like Meraki's Arnold, this fast-growing outsourcing sector also offers a new lease of life as bustling trading rooms steadily dwindle in the era of algorithms and automation.
""I believe that outsourcing in the asset management community is still in an early growth phase and that more and more managers will utilize firms like ours,"" he said."
782,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 08:01PM ET</span>","Exclusive - Petrobras LPG unit seen attracting Mubadala, SHV, Itausa bids: sources","By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Bidding groups led by Brazilian investment firm Itausa Investimentos SA (SA:ITSA4), Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala and SHV Energy of the Netherlands are expected to submit binding proposals to acquire state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4)'s LPG unit, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.
Private equity firms CVC Capital Partners and Advent International have decided not to bid, the sources said ahead of a Wednesday deadline, after deciding the deal would be a better fit for strategic buyers. CVC and Advent declined to comment.
The Brazilian government said in July it was discussing new rules to increase competitiveness in the natural gas industry, including liquid petroleum gas (LPG), in a move that is likely to affect bids for Liquigas, as the Petrobras unit is known.
Itausa has partnered with local LPG distribution firm Copagaz to place a bid, the sources said, asking for anonymity to disclose private talks.
SHV Energy, which distributes LPG in Brazil through its Supergasbras subsidiary, is also expected to bid in a consortium with local rival Consigaz, they said.
Mubadala Investment Company PJSC is planning to deliver a binding offer as well, the people added.
Itausa, SHV and Supergasbras declined to comment. Copagaz, Consigaz and Mubadala did not immediately comment on the matter.
It remains unclear whether Ultrapar Participações SA (SA:UGPA3) will partner with another investor to bid for Liquigas. In 2016, Petrobras had agreed to sell Liquigas to Ultrapar, but the deal was blocked by Brazil's antitrust watchdog.
Now, to comply with the rules Petrobras created to avoid new antitrust hurdles, Ultrapar needs to join up with other investors if it wants to bid.
Those rules restrict any LPG distributor with a more than 10% market share from taking any more than a 30% stake in a bidding consortium.
Petrobras is expected to raise between 2.5 billion reais ($630 million) and 3 billion reais ($755 million) with the sale of the unit.
Petrobras received eight bids on the first round, on June 11.  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA, which is advising Petrobras on the deal, declined to comment.
The Liquigas sale is the next step in Petrobras CEO Roberto Castello Branco's plan to sell assets and increase expenditures in core offshore exploration areas.
So far this year, Petrobras has raised more than $12.7 billion, selling pipeline network company TAG for $8.7 billion and privatizing fuel distribution unit  Petrobras Distribuidora  SA (SA:BRDT3) through a share offering that raised $2.5 billion.
Last month, the company also sold three oil fields for $1.5 billion."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street slumped on Monday and futures pointed to more losses to come after a fall in China's yuan currency and U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods sparked an escalation of the U.S.-China trade war.
S&P 500 futures  late in the day dropped over 1% after the United States officially designated China a currency manipulator, sharply escalating the ongoing dispute between the world's two largest economies. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement that Washington will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate unfair competition from Beijing. 
During Monday's session, the benchmark S&P 500 slid about 3% to mark its biggest one-day percentage decline since Dec. 4. That slump amounted to a $766 billion loss on paper for the index, according to Refinitiv data. 
The S&P 500 has fallen for six consecutive sessions and is now about 6% below its record closing high on July 26.
The drop in S&P 500 futures late on Monday suggests investors expect Wall Street to open with more losses on Tuesday.
The yuan weakened past the key seven-per-dollar level to its lowest level in 11 years, after the People's Bank of China, with the blessing of policymakers in Beijing, set its daily midpoint at the weakest level in eight months.
Trump on Monday called the weakening of the yuan a ""major violation,"" and ""currency manipulation"" on Twitter.
Several investors viewed the move in the Chinese currency as a direct response to Trump's announcement of 10% tariffs on an additional $300 billion of imports from China.
""It's the escalation of the trade war,"" said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. ""The dollar strengthening presents another issue. For companies that do a lot of business outside the U.S., it all adds up.""
A weaker yuan and a stronger dollar pose challenges for U.S. companies that do substantial business in China by effectively raising the cost of their goods for Chinese customers.
Adding to the tensions, China's Commerce Ministry said Chinese companies have stopped buying U.S. agricultural products and that Beijing will not rule out imposing import tariffs on U.S. farm products that were bought after Aug. 3.
Shares of S&P 500 technology companies (SPLRCT), which are heavily exposed to Chinese markets, dropped 4.1%.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shares slid 5.2% as analysts warned that the newly proposed tariffs may hurt demand for the iPhone, while the Philadelphia semiconductor index (SOX) dropped 4.4%.
Stocks could slide further if there are no signs of improvement in U.S.-China trade relations before September, when the recently announced tariffs are to take effect, said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.
""There's a little bit of a vacuum in the market for the next several weeks,"" he said. ""We're in this corrective phase, and it likely has further to go.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 767.27 points, or 2.9%, to 25,717.74, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 87.31 points, or 2.98%, to 2,844.74 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 278.03 points, or 3.47%, to 7,726.04.
The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX (VIX), an options-based gauge of investor anxiety, rose 6.98 points to 24.59, its highest in about seven months.
No. 1 U.S. meat processor  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) provided a bright spot as its shares rose 5.1% after the company beat quarterly profit estimates.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 6.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 6.46-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 32 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 13 new highs and 280 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.41 billion shares, compared with the 6.8 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 07:06PM ET</span>",U.S.-China trade row sends U.S. bond yields tumbling,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields tumbled on Monday, with 10-year yields hitting the lowest since November 2016, as fears over escalating U.S.-China trade tensions renewed concerns about an economic downturn and spurred a fourth straight session of gains in bonds.
China allowed the yuan to breach the key seven-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade, a sign Beijing might be willing to tolerate more currency weakness that could further inflame the bilateral trade conflict.
Chinese state media said local firms have halted U.S. agricultural purchases, elevating anxiety about tit-for-tat moves by the world's two biggest economies. The Chinese measures followed U.S. President Donald Trump's threat last week to impose 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports starting Sept. 1.
""There's a lot of fears out there,"" said Larry Milstein, head of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co in New York. ""What is the path that could end this? It doesn't seem we are going to get there anytime soon.""
The growing trade friction seemed to have begun hurting the U.S. services sector on top of squeezing domestic manufacturers.
The Institute for Supply Management's index on U.S. services activity showed the vast economic sector's growth slowed to its weakest level in three years in July.
Anxious investors have been bailing from stocks and other risky assets with Wall Street's main stock indexes falling 2%.
They have favored U.S. government debt, the Japanese yen, gold and other perceived low-risk assets to park their money.
The Treasuries market recorded a total return of 1.31% last week, which was its biggest weekly gain since November 2011, according to an index compiled by Bloomberg and  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
In late U.S. trading, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) was down 12.7 basis points at 1.7278%. It hit 1.728% earlier on Monday, the lowest since Nov. 9, 2016, the day after Trump was elected president.
The two-year yield (US2YT=RR), which is sensitive to traders' view on Fed policy, touched 1.571%, its lowest since November 2017. It was last 14.7 basis points lower at 1.5753%.
Interest rates futures implied traders fully expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower rates again at its Sept. 17-18 policy meeting after cutting them last week for the first time since 2008, CME Group's FedWatch program showed.
The difference between the three-month Treasury bill rate (US3MT=RR) and 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) grew to nearly 27 basis points, the widest since April 2007.
This curve ""inversion"" between the two maturities has preceded every U.S. recession in the past 50 years.
The blistering demand for Treasuries is expected to stoke bids for this week's quarterly refunding where the government will sell $38 billion in three-year debt, $27 billion in 10-year notes and $19 billion in 30-year bonds.
""I wouldn't expect to have a major impact on refunding,"" said Jon Hill, an interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets.

785,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 06:36PM ET</span>",Stocks - Expanding U.S.-China Trade Fight Slams Markets,"Investing.com - U.S. stocks suffered their worst one-day losses since early December after a trade war between the United States and China abruptly worsened.
The selloff saw the Dow Jones industrials lose nearly 1,000 points intraday before late-day buying kicked in and limited the losses.
Still, the Dow closed down 2.9%. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 3.0% and the Nasdaq Composite index fell about 3.5%. The percentage losses were the worst for the major indexes this year.
All three indexes ended the day down 6% from records set only three weeks ago. Despite the turmoil, the Dow is up 10.3% in 2019, with the S&P 500 up 13.5% and the Nasdaq up 16.4%. 
Markets will face more stress Tuesday after the Trump Administration late Monday declared China a currency manipulator. The move is designed to get the International Monetary Fund involved in the dispute. Futures tied to the Dow were off more than 350 points by 6:30 p.m. ET. S&P 500 futures were down 33 points.
Monday's rout was started when China allowed the yuan to sink in apparent retaliation against U.S. threats to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods imported into the United States. The devaluation pushed USD/CNY above 7 per U.S. dollar. The move makes U.S. goods expensive to buy in China and Chinese goods cheaper to buy in the United States.
In addition, The Xi Jinping administration added more ammunition to the trade fight by ordering state-owned companies to suspend imports of U.S. agricultural products. President Donald Trump complained last week China had reneged on promises to buy more U.S. farm products, especially soybeans.
After a meeting between Chinese and U.S. officials last week didn't go well, Trump ordered the tariffs boost. The Wall Street Journal reported his decision came over objections from his advisors.
China, aggressively asserting a leadership role in global trade matters, has said it won't be bullied.
All 30 Dow stocks were lower, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) the worst performer, down more than 5%. The plunge subtracted about 70 points from the Dow, which was off 767 points.
In addition, only 12 S&P 500 stocks were higher on the day. But every stock in the Nasdaq 100 Index was lower. The index, down 277 points, or 3.6%, tracks big non-financial stocks and has a concentration on tech stocks. The loss reflects the drubbing suffered by Apple; Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), down 3.5%; and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), down 3.2. Those accounted for more than a third of the point loss. 
The stock market's performance reflects worries not just over the China trade fight, which has been going on for more than a year. It also reflects worries that the global economy is slowing, dragged down by trade skirmishes around the world. Japan and Korea are arguing over sales of semiconductors that Korean companies need to power their products. 
The United States and Europe are struggling to negotiate a deal over auto imports.
In addition, the U.S. economy is stubbornly growing at a less-than-3% annual rate, to the frustration of the White House, which touted its big 2017-18 tax bill as guaranteeing faster growth.
The stock slump fueled interest in safety, and interest rates also fell around the world. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.735% from Friday's 1.855%. All of Germany's sovereign debt is yielding negative returns for the first time.
Gold assumed its traditional role as safe haven, rising 1.3% to $1,476.50 in futures trading.
Crude oil fell as well.
New-York traded West Texas Intermediate crude settled down 97 cents, or 1.7%, at $54.69 per barrel.
London-traded Brent crude, the benchmark for oil outside of the U.S., slid $2.05, or 3.3%, to $59.81.
The earnings season may come to the fore on Tuesday. The big report will come after the close when Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) reports fiscal-third quarter results. Analysts polled by Investing.com expect The Mouse to report $1.72 a share in earnings, down from $1.87 a year ago. Revenue is forecast at $21.5 billion, built on very strong performances from a string of blockbuster movies.
Shares are up 26% this year. 
Also reporting Tuesday is Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), the casino operator which has extensive operations in Macau in China. Wynn fell 7.2%, unable to get out of the way of the U.S.-China trade fight.
Winners and Losers in the S&P 500
 Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), chemical manufacturer Linde (NYSE:LIN) and pharmaceutical company  ABIOMED  (NASDAQ:ABMD) were among the top S&P 500 stocks on the day.
 Nektar Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:NKTR), Wynn Resorts and Chinese internet services provider Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) were among the S&P 500 laggards on the day."
786,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 06:15PM ET</span>",Stock market slump raises fears of deeper pain,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sharper losses could be in store for Wall Street.
The S&P 500's (SPX) 3.2 percent slump on Monday in reaction to an escalating U.S.-China trade war has added to fears that a prolonged market correction could already have started.
The slide left the benchmark index down 6% from its record high close on July 26. That was its deepest fall from a record high since a 6.8 percent selloff that began in early May and lasted a month, also driven by nervousness about the year-long trade conflict.
Many investors define a stock market correction as a fall of at least 10 percent from a high, often as a reaction to excessive gains.
""We now need to prepare ourselves for a sharper U.S. equity market correction as investors reprice the risk to the economy from the trade war – and the stronger U.S. dollar,"" warned Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors in London. ""The Federal Reserve will now be under severe pressure to cut policy rates again at the September meeting to offset the downside impact.”
Monday's sell-off was sparked after China let the yuan currency tumble beyond the 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade. It was a sign Beijing might be willing to tolerate further currency weakness in the face of the escalating trade dispute with the United States.
The sharp 1.4% drop in the yuan comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump stunned investors by vowing to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, abruptly breaking a brief month-long ceasefire in the bruising trade war.
Trump has measured himself by the success of the stock market, tweeting about its record levels during his administration. He has also lambasted Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively in order to support the market.
""I don't think the Fed has the ability to forestall a recession with just interest rate cuts if this trade war continues to worsen,"" said Robert Pavlik, a senior portfolio manager at Slatestone Wealth LLC in New York. ""I'm not saying it’s going to happen, but the president is playing a very risky game here.""
The latest salvos between Beijing and Washington have increased fears about a further slowdown of the already fragile global economy.
After the Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates for the first time in over a decade, traders of interest-rate futures are pricing in about a one-in-three chance of a half-point rate cut in September, up from less than a 2% chance for such a large reduction seen on Friday.

Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has weathered three declines of 10% or more from a record high close. Following a 14% correction that began in May 2015, the index took 286 days to recover and beat its previous record high. More recently, a nearly 20% slump that started last September went on for 145 days before the S&P 500 reached a new high.
""Given the surge in equity volume that kicked off this correction, we think it is likely that this correction is going to persist for a month or so before renewed buybacks take stocks back up to and through the prior highs,"" predicted Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Reynolds Strategy LLC, in a research note. Reynolds said he believes ""this is yet another panic and not a crisis.""

With U.S. semiconductor companies relying heavily on China for their revenue, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) on Monday tumbled 4.4%, its deepest one-day loss since May. The chip index has outperformed the broader market in 2019, with investors piling into the volatile sector on bets that the Fed would lower interest rates and on expectations that the worst of a global downturn in demand may be over.
Other manufacturing and industrial companies that rely on China have also tumbled.

In May, the group had forecast sales to rise slightly from the 78.5 billion euros ($87.9 billion) generated in 2018. In an interview with Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Bosch Chief Executive Officer Volkmar Denner said that the group would also not be able to keep 2018's margin level.
Last year, Bosch's operating margin stood at 7.0%.
""Our plans foresee a stagnation in vehicle production in the coming years, which is different from the past, when it was usually going up. The tailwind is gone,"" Denner was quoted as saying, adding jobs would have to be cut.
""There will be consequences for our employees, above all in the diesel plants,"" Denner said, without being more specific. He said the group would do everything to carry out staff reduction in a socially responsible manner.
Weakness in the car industry has already led Bosch's rivals ZF Friedrichshafen and Continental (DE:CONG) to issue profit warnings."

Ackman announced the exit from ADP in a letter sent to clients and seen by Reuters on Monday. Investors earned a 51% return, including dividends, on the investment and his firm Pershing Square made $1.2 billion on the bet which was made roughly two years ago, Ackman said.
Ackman has also told investors privately that the firm exited its investment in United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) after the hedge fund manager in June urged the company to call off its planned merger with Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).
Ackman sent a letter to the chief executive of United Technologies saying he was ""extremely concerned"" about the merger which is slated to occur after United Technologies spins off its Carrier and Otis businesses next year. 
The announcements about ADP and UTX are the most significant moves Ackman has unveiled this year and come at a time his firm is making waves with double-digit returns as Ackman himself stays largely out of the limelight.
Through July, Pershing Square Holdings, Ackman's publicly traded portfolio, has gained 49.4%, compared with the average hedge fund's return of roughly 5% during the same period.
Ackman wrote that he exited ADP because he expects future returns to be more modest now that the market is ""more accurately pricing in ADP's prospects for success.""
He told analysts that the firm had exited United Technologies at a meeting last week.

A Pershing Square spokesman declined to comment on Monday.

789,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 06:02PM ET</span>",Big U.S. investors use summer sell-off to ramp up bets,"By David Randall and Jennifer Ablan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The summer sell-off is finally here - and not all U.S. investors are rattled by it.
After a record-setting first half of the year that pushed U.S. stock markets to new highs, a more than 760-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday, triggered by the escalating U.S.-China trade war, gave battered shortsellers a chance to recoup some of what data firm S3 Partners estimates at nearly $116 billion in losses since the start of January.
Meanwhile, frustrated long-term investors who have been waiting for an entry point into a U.S. stock market whose trailing price to earnings ratio of 20.1 is well above its historical average, are pouncing. They are adding to their portfolios in anticipation that further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve or a resumption of trade talks this fall could send the U.S. market on an upward path once again.
""It's very hard for risk assets to suffer a prolonged and sustained sharp drawdown,"" when the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates and the U.S. jobs market continues to be strong, said Ashwin Alankar, head of global asset allocation at Janus Henderson Investors.
""This could be fixed overnight with one tweet from Trump,"" Alankar said.
Few are betting on a quick snapback in the markets. Yet investors are finding opportunities in assets ranging from Chinese e-commerce companies to domestic retailers like  Shoe Carnival  Inc (O:SCVL).
Hedge fund investor Andrew Left of Citron Research said he sold half of his China exposure a few months ago but is still long select names such as e-commerce firm JD.com Inc (O:JD), which is now his largest position.
""This volatility is not as scary ... just seems like a deleveraging day,"" Left said.
Portfolio manager Eric Marshall, whose Hodges Small Cap retail fund is up nearly 50% for the year, said he is adding to consumer stocks like restaurant chain  Texas Roadhouse  Inc (O:TXRH) and Shoe Carnival, which have both been hurt by concerns over the trade war.
""We've been on the sidelines and today we're actively taking new positions in stocks that have more than adequately factored in worries about the trade tariffs and currency fluctuations,"" he said.
ECHOES OF 2015
The market's latest steep losses are reminiscent of August 2015 when an unexpected Chinese currency devaluation sent shockwaves through global markets.
Late Sunday, China let the yuan breach the key 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade and announced it was halting its purchases of U.S. agricultural products, halting a global rally which had pushed benchmark indexes in the United States and China up more than 20% for the year to date.
It was the latest salvo in a brewing trade-turned-currency war between the world's two largest economies.
A weaker yuan allows China to offset some of the pressure from tariffs on its exports, which U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly said on Thursday he would increase by imposing an additional 10% levy on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods effective Sept. 1. Since then, the S&P 500 has declined by approximately 5%, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to its lowest level since before the 2016 U.S. elections.
That is rewarding bearish investors like Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer at Doubleline Capital, who told Reuters Monday he was ""bullish"" on gold since it traded at $1,190. The price of the precious metal rose above $1,450 on Monday.
""I keep telling people for months you’ve got to look at a chart and notice that this is not a raging bull market,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""The market is not making any progress and hasn’t for 18 months. Everywhere you look, economic data is worse than it was last October.""
Market strategists, meanwhile, are becoming increasingly worried that a slowing U.S. economy will put pressure on stock market valuations, leaving the broad market to stall.
""I don't think you have to buy every dip, and this is a dip I wouldn't be buying,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities.
The steep declines, which have added to the worst week for stocks in 2019, are leading investors to add to bets that the Federal Reserve will continue lowering interest rates to stabilize the economy.
The fed funds futures market now points to a 100% chance of at least a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, with about a one-in-three chance of a half-point cut, according to CME FedWatch tool. Lower rates are often seen as equity-friendly because they push investors toward riskier assets.
Jon Adams, a portfolio manager at BMO Global Asset Management, said rising expectations of further interest rate declines blunted the impact of Monday's sell-off.
""Global central banks are showing that they are willing to do whatever they can to extend the economic cycle,"" he said. ""You could a get comment from the Fed here in coming weeks which will put a floor under equity markets."""
790,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 05:52PM ET</span>",Walmart faces pressure to stop gun sales after latest U.S. mass shootings,"By Nandita Bose and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Monday there has been no change in its policy on gun sales after two mass shootings over the weekend, including one at a Walmart store, left 31 people dead in Texas and Ohio.
Years of public pressure led Walmart, the largest U.S arms retailer, to end assault rifle sales in 2015 and in 2018 to raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21. Some gun control activists and Walmart customers now want the retailer to drop sales of guns and ammunition altogether.
The weekend shooting in Texas unfolded at a popular Walmart store in the border city of El Paso, killing 22 people. In the other weekend mass shooting, in Dayton, Ohio, a gunman killed nine people.
Many people took to social media to post about the deadly shooting using the hashtags #walmartshooting,"" ""#boycottwalmart,"" and ""#guncontrolnow.""
Guns Down America, an advocacy group that runs campaigns for gun control, began a petition to urge more change at Walmart late on Monday.
The petition calls on Walmart to stop selling firearms, pledge it will no longer make contributions to lawmakers who take money from gun rights lobby the National Rifle Association, and fund gun buybacks. It also pushes Walmart to use its political influence to advocate for legislative changes to raise the standards for gun ownership in America. 
""Federal legislative change will take time, but more and more Americans are dying every day,"" Igor Volsky, founder and executive director of Guns Down America, told Reuters. ""The El Paso shooting happened in their store, they have a responsibility to go further.""
It is not the first time that gun-control advocates have signed a petition calling on Walmart to take action. In early 2013, just one month after a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut, shot dead 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school, nearly 300,000 people signed a petition urging Walmart to stop selling assault weapons.
It was another two years before Walmart ended such sales.
""A REASON TO BOYCOTT WALMART""
Other gun control activists such as Texas Gun Sense President Ed Scruggs said Walmart, whose stores act as de facto community centers in rural America, could do more to educate children and teenagers on gun safety.
A group called Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America said it has been asking Walmart to stop letting shoppers walk into its stores with guns - even where doing so is permitted by law.  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have policies asking shoppers not to carry firearms in their stores. 
On Twitter, one Florida-based user said Walmart needs more security. Another user, from Irvine, California, said Walmart's statement outlining that it would not change its gun policies in the wake of the two shootings over the weekend was ""shocking.""
""If this isn't a reason to boycott Walmart, I don't know what is!"" the user tweeted.
Some celebrities also demanded more action from the retailer.
""Hey @Walmart! This would be a great opportunity for you to take a true leadership position and stop selling guns,"" actress Alyssa Milano said in response to a Walmart company tweet saying it was ""in shock"" over the tragic events in Texas. 
For now, Walmart's policies remain unchanged.
A Walmart spokesman on Monday told Reuters the retailer has not made any change in its firearms sales policy after the mass shootings and that it has not issued a directive to any stores around the country to change policy.
""Our focus has always been on being a responsible seller of firearms,"" spokesman Randy Hargrove said. ""We go beyond federal law, requiring all customers to pass a background check before purchasing any firearm."" 
The retailer's chief executive, Doug McMillon, offered his support to the community of El Paso and reached out to employees via Instagram on Sunday. ""I can't believe I'm sending a note like this twice in one week,"" he said, referring to an earlier message he sent after two employees were shot by a co-worker in a store in Mississippi.
Walmart's gun safety policies are more restrictive than many retailers' even as it trails some of its rivals.
Walmart rivals like Kroger-owned Fred Meyer stopped selling guns and ammunition in 2018 and the same year, Dick's Sporting Goods ended the sale of assault weapons and raised the minimum age to 21 for gun purchases. 
In March 2019, Dick's also said it would pull guns and ammunition off the shelves of 125 of its 720 store, a decision the company said it took because its gun sales were down due to competition from dedicated gun and hunting stores.
That same month, in a call to discuss earnings, the company's chief executive, Ed Stack, said lower sales during the quarter were partly driven by lower demand for ""anything associated with hunting,"" including guns, ammunition, firearm accessories and hunting apparel.
Despite such measures from the larger chains, the sale of guns and assault-style weapons continues unabated.
Outdoor goods chains including Bass Pro Shops, Gander Outdoors and Academy Sports continue to sell assault-style rifles. A proliferation of online retailers like AIM Surplus, Armslist and Brownells also sell firearms that can be easily procured. 

Armslist called the shootings ""horrific"" and said in a statement it is a service that does not directly sell guns, but carries ads and listing for private sales. The other companies did not respond to a request for comment.

792,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 05:25PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are 3 things that could rock the markets tomorrow.
1.  Disney , Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) Ready Earnings Reports
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) will report earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday.
Ahead of Disney's earnings, investor expectations are running high that the entertainment company will report a good quarter, led by the success of its blockbuster movie ""Avengers: Endgame"" at the box office and a jump in attendance at Disneyland. 
 Disney  (NYSE:DIS) is expected to report earnings of $1.72 a share on revenue of $21.46 billion. 
As well as earnings, commentary on the Disney+, the company's streaming service set to launch Nov. 12, will also be closely watched.
Disney shares fell 2.4% on Monday but are still up 26.1% on the year.
Oil-and-gas producer Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), meanwhile, is expected to poast a loss of 6 cents per share on $2.4 billion in revenue. It reports before the bell.
Chesapeake has struggled in the last few years in the face of volatile oil and natural gas prices and a heavy debt load. Shares are off 21.9% this year after rising 47.6% in the first quarter.
2. China's Yuan, Aussie-Dollar to Remain in Focus
The yuan likely will continue to draw close attention after a plunge on Monday to more than 7 per U.S. dollar, a level where Chinese policymakers had previously supported its value. 
USD/CNY ended the day up 1.62% to 7.05 after the People's Bank of China set its daily reference rate for yuan at 6.92, the weakest rate since December last year.
China's decision to weaken its currency, however, in the wake of escalating trade tensions, could be a one-off. 
 ""Beijing is well aware of the negative costs linked to currency depreciation, from capital markets to capital outflows,"" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management. ""Policymakers appear wary of unhinging expectations for yuan stability.""
3. JOLTs Data on Tap
Following last week’s employment report, figures from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) will be in focus for further insight into hiring trends. 
The Labor Department will release its June JOLTs report at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that job openings rose to 7.45 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard is set to deliver a speech at 12 PM ET (16:00 GMT) on the U.S. economy on Tuesday amid growing expectations the Fed will cut rates in September. 
According to investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, 73% of traders expect the central bank to lower rates by a quarter point for the second time this year in September. The remaining 27% are expecting a half-point reduction. "
793,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 05:14PM ET</span>","'NBA 2K', 'Grand Theft Auto V' help Take-Two surge past estimates","By Sayanti Chakraborty and Kenneth Li
(Reuters) - Videogame publisher  Take-Two Interactive  Software Inc (O:TTWO) raised its full-year revenue forecast on Monday, boosted by the success of its games ""NBA 2K"", ""Grand Theft Auto V"" and ""Red Dead Redemption 2"", sending its shares up 7% in extended trading.
The company, which has been working to secure a foothold in the changing gaming landscape, has managed to prevail over challenges posed by the rise of mobile-based, free-to-play games with its desktop- and console-based games mostly.
""Grand Theft Auto V"" has sold nearly 100 million units since its launch in 2013, making it one of the best-selling games ever for the company. 
""NBA 2K19"", which debuted last September, was the 5th best-selling game of 2018, according to research firm NPD.
Both the games were among the top-10 selling video games in June, according to NPD.
Take-Two's 2017 acquisition of Spanish mobile game developer Social Point also helped the traditional game publisher widen its presence in the mobile gaming sector with games ""WWE"", ""SuperCard"" and ""WWE 2K19"" and compete against Glu Mobile (O:GLUU) and  Zynga Inc  (O:ZNGA).
Take-Two raised its annual forecast to $2.60 billion and $2.70 billion in adjusted revenue, up from its prior forecast $2.50 billion to $2.60 billion. 
Analysts had expected $2.65 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
New York-based Take-Two forecast second-quarter revenue of $860 million to $910 million, above analysts' estimates of $852.5 million.
On an adjusted basis, the game publisher's revenue in the first quarter ended June 30 stood at $422.2 million, soaring above the average analyst estimate of $356.8 million.
Rival Electronic Arts (O:EA) posted first-quarter revenue above estimates last month, boosted by the strength of its battle royale game ""Apex Legends"".
Shares of the company as well as other video game companies tanked after President Donald Trump, in response to the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, called for an end to glorification of violence and blamed ""gruesome and grisly video games"" for that.
""We are sickened and saddened by these tragedies. But to blame the video game industry is irresponsible and disrespectful to the families of the victims,"" Chief Executive Officer Strauss Zelnick told Reuters. ""(Video games) are consumed worldwide. But gun violence is uniquely American and we need to address the issues.""
More than 165 million Americans enjoy video games, and billions of people play video games worldwide. Yet other societies, where video games are played as avidly, do not contend with the tragic levels of violence that occur in the United States, said Entertainment Software Association in a statement.
Take-Two's net income fell to $46.3 million, or 41 cents per share, from $71.7 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier.

Faced with declining revenue, Gannet has invested millions in the last few years to scale up its digital footprint. Sales, however, haven't quite picked up as yet. The company, which also owns local papers ranging from the Detroit Free Press to the El Paso Times, missed second-quarter revenue on Monday.
Now by merging, the companies expect to cut costs by $275-300 million annually and said they would together have 263 daily media organizations across 47 states, as well as USA Today. New Media and Gannett are the largest U.S. newspaper owners by circulation, according to Statista.
About 25% of the combined company's revenue will come from digital, New Media Chief Executive Officer Michael Reed said on a conference call. 
New Media is run by Fortress Investment Group, which is owned by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), and has built the largest chain of local U.S. papers, including 156 dailies from the Austin American-Statesman to the Register-Guard in Eugene, Oregon.
After the merger closes, expected by the second half of 2019, New Media will hold about 50.5% stake in the combined company, to be led by Reed.
Gannett shareholders will receive $6.25 in cash and 0.5427 of a New Media share for each share they hold, amounting to $12.06, which represents 12.2% premium to Gannett's Friday close.
The $1.4 billion equity value is based on 116.7 million outstanding shares as of June 30. 
Both New Media and its operating subsidiary GateHouse will be rebranded and operate under brand ""Gannett"".
Earlier this year, Gannett fended off newspaper chain MNG Enterprises's  efforts to put its nominees on its board, after it rejected MNG's $1.36 billion hostile takeover bid. 
Shares of Gannett closed up 2.6% at $11.04, while those of New Media Investment Group closed down 7.6% at $9.89. 

While New Media reported revenue of $404 million in its second quarter on Monday, Gannett had revenue of $660 million.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 04:56PM ET</span>",Former United Auto Workers official gets 15 months in labor corruption case,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - A federal judge in Detroit on Monday sentenced the former United Auto Workers union vice president in charge of relations with  Fiat  Chrysler to 15 months in federal prison for misusing funds intended for worker training to pay for luxury travel, golf, liquor and parties for himself and other union officials.
Norwood Jewell, 61, who led the UAW's national contract negotiations with Fiat Chrysler in 2015, is the highest ranking UAW official to be sentenced in connection with a wide-ranging federal investigation of corruption within the union that represents U.S. factory workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
Jewell pleaded guilty in April to a single charge of violating the Labor Relations Management Act. At the time, prosecutors proposed a prison sentence of 12 to 18 months. U.S. District Judge Paul Borman rejected Jewell's request to avoid prison and serve his sentence under house arrest.
""He betrayed his position,"" Borman said from the bench.
Jewell is the eighth former UAW or Fiat Chrysler official sentenced as part of the federal criminal investigation of UAW finances. Federal prosecutors are continuing to investigate the misuse of company and union funds at the Detroit automakers.
Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Mike Manley, during a meeting with reporters last week, declined to discuss whether the company is in talks with federal authorities or whether he has been interviewed by investigators.
Federal prosecutors have said Fiat Chrysler officials conspired in the misuse of $4.5 million in training center funds. 
Fiat Chrysler's former vice president of labor relations, Alphons Iacobelli, pleaded guilty in January 2018 to charges of violating the Labor Management Relations Act and filing false tax returns. Prosecutors charged Iacobelli with making hundreds of thousands of dollars in improper payments to charities controlled by UAW officials, and agreeing to pay off the mortgage of a now-deceased UAW vice president, General Holiefield.
Prosecutors said Jewell accepted over $90,000 in illegal payments from Fiat Chrysler for his own benefit and to pay for travel, golf outings, parties and other entertainment for senior UAW leaders. ""The parties included thousands of dollars in Fiat Chrysler money spent on 20 boxes of cigars, ultra-premium liquor, personalized bottles of wine, and women paid to light the cigars of senior UAW leaders,"" federal prosecutors said in a statement on Monday.
Jewell, in a statement to the court, portrayed himself as a leader betrayed by his staff, and expressed regret for being sloppy in accounting for expenses.
However, prosecutor David Gardey said Jewell and other senior UAW officials enjoyed a ""high-flying lifestyle"" of ""premium liquor and fine steaks"" on company and union money. Fiat Chrysler, Gardey told the court, wanted UAW officials to be ""fat, dumb and happy."" 
Mike Booth, president of UAW local 961, which represents a Fiat Chrysler axle plant in Marysville, Michigan, told Borman that Jewell and other UAW leaders who accepted company favors betrayed union members. 
""This is not a victimless crime,"" Booth said.
The UAW, in a statement issued on Monday after the sentencing, said the union's new leadership ""is determined to earn back our members’ trust"" and ""will draw the line on more concessions to an auto industry flush in profits.” 

Local 961 has gone to court to block the transfer of the axle plant to a Fiat Chrysler supplier and has accused UAW officials of corruptly acquiescing to the sale.

799,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 04:14PM ET</span>",Stocks – China's Currency Tumble Batters U.S. and Global Stocks,"Investing.com - Stocks were suffering their worst one-day losses since February 2018 on Monday after China allowed the yuan to sink in apparent retaliation against U.S. threats to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods imported into the United States.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials  each tumbled 3.2%. The Nasdaq Composite plunged nearly 4%. Markets around the world also slumped as the trade war flared up again. 
The yuan USD/CNY was allowed to weaken to more than 7 yuan per dollar, a level not seen in at least 10 years The effect is to make Chinese goods cheaper against U.S. goods and dampen U.S. exports to China.
The Trump Administration and China's government have been waging a furious game of tariffs and counter-tariffs as Trump seeks to rebalance the trade relationship between the countries. After a meeting between Chinese and U.S. officials last week didn't go well, Trump ordered the tariffs boosted.
China, aggressively asserting a leadership role in global trade matters, has said it won't be bullied.
All 30 Dow stocks were lower, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) the worst performer, down more than 5.4%. The plunge subtracted 75 points from the Dow. Losses in Visa (NYSE:V) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) subtracted a combined 120 points from the Dow, which was off 960 points at 3:20 PM ET (19:20 GMT).
Among the few gainers Monday were gun makers and   Tyson Foods   (NYSE:TSN). Gun stocks rose in the belief that gun regulations imposed after the El Paso and Dayton shootings would boost firearms sales.
Interest rates also fell around the world. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.728% from Friday's 1.855%. All of Germany's sovereign debt is yielding negative returns for the first time. 
Rates have been falling as global business and leaders worry about economic slowdowns. HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) ousted its CEO and said it would be cutting some 4,000 jobs over the next year.
In addition, crude oil prices fell, with Brent futures, the global benchmark, down $1.94 to $59.97 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude was down $1.87 or 3% to $60."
800,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 03:34PM ET</span>",Yield Curve Blares Loudest U.S. Recession Warning Since 2007,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest eruption in the U.S.-China trade dispute pushed a widely watched Treasury-market recession indicator to the highest alert since 2007.
Rates on 10-year notes sank to 1.74% on Monday, close to completely erasing the surge that followed President Donald Trump’s 2016 election. In early trading, they fetched as much as 32 basis points less than three-month bills, the most extreme yield-curve inversion since just before the 2008 crisis.
The move follows reports that China is responding to the U.S. president’s threat of more tariffs by allowing the yuan to fall and halting imports of U.S. agricultural products. Many major investors expect this slide in 10-year yields to continue given the risk this creates for markets.
Count BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., the world’s largest asset manager, among them. The firm’s global chief investment officer of fixed income, Rick Rieder, foresees 1.5% for the 10-year.
“We could be in a significantly lower-rate environment for a while” given that central banks are poised to ease, he told Bloomberg Television on Monday.
Columbia Threadneedle’s Ed Al-Hussainy also sees the potential for a further leg down in the 10-year benchmark, but says Federal Reserve rate cuts could help the yield curve snap back from its inversion.
“Potentially now the curve starts to steepen because the Fed is being pressured by a combination of data and obviously downside risks in trade to be more forceful,” the senior strategist said in a phone interview.
Heavy buying in fed funds futures contracts in the days since the Fed last week delivered its quarter-point reduction has driven the market to price in another reduction in September, and then some.
Al-Hussainy expects investors to turn to even more aggressive positioning for rate cuts. He says the signal from the curve suggests money markets should be pricing in a higher probability of the Fed’s policy rate going to zero in the coming year.
“There’s a huge disconnect now,” he said. “You don’t need to do a lot of mental gymnastics to get to the Fed having to cut 200 basis points to put off a recession.”"

806,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 02:38PM ET</span>",The Fed Can't Offset Trump's Trade War With Earnings This Shaky,"(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump has long made it clear that he wants the Federal Reserve’s help shoring up the economy as he fights his trade war with China. To investors, it’s starting to look like that won’t be enough.
Stocks are in freefall and bonds are rallying around the world following the latest escalation by Beijing, just days after Trump announced new tariffs and the Fed lowered interest rates for the first time in a decade.
Money managers are now virtually certain the central bank will ease again in September but a growing cohort say cheaper money won’t fix what’s ailing the global economy.
Chief among their concerns: Reports of a slump in manufacturing worldwide, signs that profit margins are easing and fears that more companies will cut earnings forecasts given the uncertainty spurred by tensions in cross-border commerce.
“Another cut of the Fed can’t really offset all of that,” said Fabiana Fedeli, global head of fundamental equities at Robeco Institutional Asset Management BV. “If the consumer feels worse-off because of the tariffs -- and if companies are starting to see the effect on their bottom line -- this brings uncertainty from the point of view of making decisions on where, and when, to invest.”
What sets the latest proposed tariffs apart is that they include a more expansive list of goods like children’s clothes and smartphones. That’s a risk to consumer spending, a hitherto resilient pillar of U.S. growth.
Most worryingly for equity managers, some signs of damage are showing up in the earnings story. Expansion in profit margins for S&P 500 companies has crumpled for two straight quarters, historically a late-cycle omen for a brewing downturn, according to Strategas Securities LLC.
American companies are still expanding their earnings with a propensity to beat analyst expectations. But the outlook is darkening. Among firms that have provided third-quarter guidance, more than half were below analyst estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. That’s the worst in four years.
While lower rates make future profits more valuable today, expectations for falling earnings could offset all that -- dragging U.S. share prices from recent records.
“We have largely put the burden of proof for economic and business cycle strength on the shoulders of corporate profits,” Strategas analysts led by Nicholas Bohnsack wrote in a note. “So margin compression means something.”
Bulls are hoping for a monetary offset of sorts. Interest-rate futures are pricing in a 28% chance of a 50 basis-point cut at the Fed’s September meeting. The fear is that the Jerome Powell put won’t pack the desired punch, as market fundamentals weaken.
“While a change in Fed policy can affect financial conditions -- and hence asset prices -- almost immediately, reversing an economic slowdown with easier monetary policy takes time,” wrote  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Mike Wilson, who has projected a 10% drop in the S&P in the third quarter.
Ports in the storm are looking scarcer.
A feature of this year’s bull run is a polarized market, ramping up premiums for perceived safety at every turn. Classic defensive plays are already aggressively bid up thanks to late-cycle angst. Growth shares, or companies expected to expand their earnings regardless of the economic cycle, are at their priciest versus the overall market in nearly two decades.
Stocks with the highest positive correlation to Treasuries -- or bond proxies -- have widened their valuation gap with the opposite cohort to the most since at least 2003, portfolios compiled by  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA showed. All that makes the market at risk of sharp rotations, especially if the mammoth bond rally reverses.
If the S&P 500 continues to tank even with the Fed dutifully slashing borrowing costs, might Trump -- given his fixation on the stock market -- be tempted to reach another truce with Beijing?
“If trade tensions are resolved and global growth re-accelerates as a result, the Fed will find itself having to make yet another u-turn,” said Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Management. “At some point, I believe there will be a violent rotation as investors find themselves mis-positioned.”
That could be months away, according to Perkin. In the meantime, more investors might be tempted to lock-in the double-digit stock windfall notched so far this year.
“The U.S. economy will not be able to rely on strong households to offset the weakness in global trade activity and weak domestic business activity.,” said Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife Asset Management. “Increased trade tensions substantially change the U.S. and global economic narrative for the second half of the year.”"

811,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 02:26PM ET</span>",U.S. Stocks Head for Worst Rout of 2019 on Trade: Markets Live,"(Bloomberg) -- Financial markets buckled after China escalated the trade war with the U.S., sending American stocks careening toward the biggest drop of the year and sparking a rally in global bonds. Gold surged with the yen.
The S&P 500 Index extended losses from a record to almost 6%, the fastest decline from a peak since January 2018, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 700 points. The broader measure was down for six straight days, mired in the longest slide since October. The Cboe Volatility Index, the market’s “fear gauge,” surged 31%. The 10-year Treasury yield was close to completely erasing the jump that followed President Donald Trump’s election. China’s yuan sank beyond 7 per dollar, a move that suggests the level is no longer a line in the sand for policy makers in Beijing. Oil slid.
Investors are starting to grasp the potential for a protracted conflict between the world’s two largest economies, with a Treasury-market recession indicator hitting the highest alert since 2007. As demand for haven assets spiked, gold made a run toward $1,500 an ounce and the Japanese yen extended its rally. Major cryptocurrencies, increasingly seen as a refuge during distressed times, climbed as Bitcoin approached $12,000.
“The trade war is now intensifying and it’s possible that a currency war will start as well,” said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. “Neither is good for the global economy and both will hurt equity markets.”
President Trump said the yuan slide is “called ‘currency manipulation”’ and indicated he’d like the Federal Reserve to act to counter the Chinese action. Swaps show bets the U.S. central bank will ease by 100 basis points by December 2020, a quarter point more than what was priced in after last week’s cut.
The trade war has been a consistent catalyst for market volatility and hopes of a resolution are now being sent even further out in the horizon, according to Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial Corp. While that could continue to challenge portfolios, investors should not make the mistake of trying to time the markets amid the sell-off, he said.
“This too shall eventually pass, and bouts of volatility in recent months have shown this can happen quickly,” said Loewengart.

816,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 01:34PM ET</span>","StockBeat: ON Semiconductor Misses on Revenue, Signals Chipwreck to Continue","Investing.com -  ON Semiconductor  slumped on Monday, exacerbating a broad-based China-inspired slump across chip stocks, as its second-quarter revenue fell short of estimates and the chipmaker warned geopolitical factors would continue to dent chip demand. 
The company reported earnings of 42 cents a share, down 9% from a year ago and in line with consensus estimates from Investing.com of 42 cents a share. But revenue of $1.35 billion, down about 7% compared to 2018, fell short of estimates for $1.38 billion, sending  ON Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:ON) tumbling more than 8%. 
The chipmaker also warned that weaker demand would continue to keep a lid on growth in the near term, forecasting 2019 third-quarter revenue to be about $1.355 to $1.405 billion and gross margin in the range of 35.2% to 36.2%.
""Business conditions continue to be soft, and we expect to see sub-seasonal demand trends in the near-term, as geopolitical factors will likely continue to weigh on demand. Despite near-term weakness in demand, key secular trends driving our business remain intact,” said Keith Jackson, President and CEO of ON Semiconductor. “Against a backdrop of soft demand and limited visibility, we continue to focus on execution to mitigate the impact of current softness in demand. We remain confident in our strategy of focusing on secular megatrends in automotive, industrial, and cloud-power end-markets, and we are prudently investing to further strengthen our position in these markets.""
The dour outlook for semis heaped further pressure on the sector on the heels of rising U.S.-China trade tensions, which have hurt chip companies with high revenue exposure to China such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). 
""This high exposure to China puts the semiconductor sector at greater risk to the escalation in the U.S.-China trade war than many other segments of technology,” said Quinn Bolton, senior semiconductor analyst at Needham.
A week after President Donald Trump threatened to impose new levies on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, effective Sept. 1, Beijing hit back, allowing the yuan to tumble to the weakest level in more than a decade and requesting state-owned companies to suspend imports of U.S. agricultural products.
That prompted a response from Trump, who on Monday accused China of currency manipulation, raising fears of an escalating trade war hitting demand. 
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was down about 4%, but boasts gains of about 23% for the year so far, well above the broader market's 14%."

821,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 01:02PM ET</span>","Tyson Foods hits record high after beating estimates, prepares for China profit boost","By Tom Polansek
(Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Monday and reaffirmed expectations it will profit from the spread of a fatal hog disease in China, sending shares to a record high.
Tyson has not yet reaped major financial gains from the deaths of millions of pigs in China's outbreak of African swine fever, Chief Executive Noel White said. China is still working its way through frozen meat supplies, but could begin to increase imports of U.S. pork to fill a shortfall as soon as October, he said.
Shares hit a record high of $87.27.
African swine fever is fatal to pigs but harmless to humans and has not been found in the United States.
China could also ramp up total imports of beef and poultry meat as Chinese consumers look for other sources of protein. That could help Tyson, which produces beef and chicken as well as pork.
""I think that all of the proteins will benefit,"" White told analysts on a conference call.
Tyson has already held discussions with meat buyers in China, the world's largest hog producer and pork consumer, White said.
But China's purchases so far have fallen short of industry expectations so far after Beijing last year imposed retaliatory duties on imports of American farm products including pork as part of the escalating U.S.-China trade war.
""As China depletes its frozen inventory and starts tapping into the global pork supply in a more meaningful way, we expect Tyson to start realizing meaningful upside, likely in early FY20,"" Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said.
Higher corn prices could limit profits for Tyson, which buys the grain to feed chickens. The size of the American crop is uncertain after farmers suffered unprecedented plantings delays this spring due to widespread flooding.
Tyson expects a year-over-year increase of $150 million to $200 million in the cost of grain, Chief Financial Officer Stewart Glendinning said.
The company recorded a $40 million gain in its chicken unit in the third quarter ended June 29 as corn futures rose, benefiting the company's position in the grain market. However, much of that profit is likely to be reversed in the fourth quarter as corn prices have pulled back, Glendinning said.
Net income attributable to Tyson rose to $676 million, or $1.84 per share, in the quarter, from $541 million, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.47 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.42.
Total sales rose 8.3% to $10.89 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $11.05 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The Justice Department said in June it launched a criminal probe related to price-fixing allegations against Tyson and other poultry processors, which the companies have denied.
Tyson subsequently received a grand jury subpoena from the Justice Department ""seeking additional documents and information related to the chicken industry,"" the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. Tyson said it is cooperating with the probe. (https:// Puerto Rico, on behalf of its citizens, has also launched a civil lawsuit against Tyson and other poultry processing companies that alleges antitrust violations, according to the filing.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's Agriculture Minister said on Monday that the South American country should remain neutral in the U.S.-China trade war while pushing Brazilian farm products in as many markets as possible.
Tereza Cristina Dias told a news conference that while the world's two largest economies work out their differences, Brazil will seek to keep good relations and trade flows with both.
“I say Brazil, though I am not the foreign minister, needs to stay out of this fight,"" she said in response to a question from a Reuters reporter.
""The U.S. is a competitor selling agricultural products to China. China is a great trade partner. Brazil has products that can be sold to both markets,” Dias said.
The minister called the United States and China ""tough negotiators"" and declined to predict an outcome of their talks. She also said Brazil would not be able to replace the United States entirely as a provider of foodstuffs to China.
""It is early to make projections,"" she said in relation to potential shifts in demand stemming for the trade war.
Brazil is monitoring the talks to assess how the outcome can affect Brazil on the global agribusiness stage, Dias said.
Brazil's excess food production feeds 1.2 billion people around the world, according to the minister, and the country will continue to negotiate access to new markets.
Dias said she is scheduled to travel to the Middle East, the United States and Canada in the coming weeks to discuss agricultural trade."

LONDON/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Amsterdam-based Takeaway.com (AS:TKWY) and British rival  Just Eat  (L:JE) have finalised the terms of their deal to create a global food delivery company that can rival Uber Eats (N:UBER) as the largest outside China.
The group, to be called Just Eat Takeaway.com, will be a market leader in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada. 
The companies said on Monday they had backed the deal as outlined on July 29, with Just Eat shareholders receiving 0.09744 new Takeaway.com shares for each of their shares.
The terms value Just Eat at around 4.7 billion pounds ($5.7 billion), based on Takeaway's price at Friday's market close.
Takeaway.com's shares have slipped around 8% since the deal was announced last week, trading at 76.70 euros on Monday morning. 
""The board believes that this is a compelling offer for Just Eat shareholders which will create a global leader in a dynamic and rapidly growing sector,"" the British firm's chairman, Mike Evans, said. 
""Together we will have the scale to address the huge opportunities in the delivery market, as ordering food moves to becoming an everyday convenience"", he told reporters.
Scale is all-important in the fast-growing $100 billion market as global rivals such as Amazon-backed (O:AMZN) Deliveroo and Uber Eats scramble to offer consumers the biggest choice.
""There is unprecedented competition in this global market, with lots of new parties"", Takeaway CEO Jitse Groen, who will lead the merged company, said.
""Bringing these two together means we can pool the profits from both, to allocate capital efficiently to 23 countries.""
The companies said their merger was expected to lead to 20 million euros ($22.2 million) in cost savings after four years, with around half of that amount expected in the first year.

The deal is set to close by the end of 2019, after which Just Eat Takeaway.com shares will be listed in London, while Takeaway's current listing in Amsterdam will disappear after a year.

839,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 11:50AM ET</span>","Tesco to cut around 4,500 jobs in Metro restructuring","By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket chain  Tesco  (L:TSCO) is cutting about 4,500 jobs from its Metro stores to improve the efficiency of a format that is increasingly used by customers daily rather than for a traditional weekly shop.
Tesco, both the biggest retailer and largest private sector employer in Britain, is restructuring operations in response to changing consumer habits, driven by the rise of online shopping and increased competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl.
The company said the changes in its 153 Metro stores - medium-sized shops found on Britain's shopping street and by railway stations - would allow it to shift stock more quickly to the shelves and cut the time it was held in the store room.
Metro stores had originally been intended for customers making a weekly shop, but Tesco said the dynamic had changed and customers are increasingly buying food daily. 
Where many staff had developed specialisms, such as selling wine, they now need to be able to work across all disciplines, the company said. 
Tesco, which had a 27.2% share in the latest data from sector researcher Kantar, has largely outperformed main rivals - Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Asda (N:WMT) and Morrisons (L:MRW) over the past year. 
However, the whole industry has remained under pressure from German challengers Aldi and Lidl, prompting Tesco to review logistics in an effort to find efficiency savings and maximize profit growth.
""In a challenging, evolving retail environment, with increasing cost pressures, we have to continue to review the way we run our stores to ensure we reflect the way our customers are shopping and do so in the most efficient way,"" said Tesco UK boss Jason Tarry.
SECTOR TURMOIL
Tesco is testing a discount format of its own. The new stores, named ""Jack's"" after the group's founder, sell a limited range of products at low prices.
The Metro job cuts, however, are another blow to a sector that has been hammered in recent years by the rapid growth of online shopping and a sluggish economy, forcing many brands to axe stores or go out of business altogether. 
The British Retail Consortium says that the ""profound transformation"" of the sector led to about 72,000 job losses in the past year. 
Tesco also said it would reduce opening hours in 134 of its 1,750 Express convenience stores and streamline stock-handling procedures in some of its larger stores. 
Employing about 320,000 people in Britain, Tesco cut thousands of jobs earlier this year when it removed fresh meat, fish and delicatessen counters from its bigger stores.
Shopworkers' union Usdaw, which said it represented more than 160,000 Tesco staff, vowed to do what it could to protect jobs and find affected staff alternative roles.
""Our members at Tesco are shocked and dismayed by yet another round of potential job losses, coming just months after 9,000 staff were put at risk in stores,"" said National Officer Pauline Foulkes.

""We will be working hard to make sure that any members potentially affected by these proposals are supported at this difficult time and throughout the consultation period.""

841,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 11:41AM ET</span>",Titanic shipyard Harland and Wolff to enter administration,"By Ian Graham
BELFAST (Reuters) - Harland and Wolff, the Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic, was put into administration on Monday after its bankrupt Norwegian owner failed to find a buyer and calls for its nationalization were rebuffed.
The shipyard, whose towering yellow cranes dominate the Northern Irish city's skyline, has been occupied by workers fearful for their jobs since last week. They said on Monday they would block administrators from entering the site.
""BDO have been appointed as administrators and the company will file for insolvency tomorrow,"" a Harland and Wolff spokesman said. 
The business was put up for sale last year by Norwegian parent Dolphin Drilling, which filed for bankruptcy in June.
Opened in 1861, Harland and Wolff employed more than 30,000 people in its World War Two heyday and remains a potent symbol of Belfast's past as an industrial engine of the British Empire. 
It has been in decline for over half a century, however, and now employs just 130 full-time workers, specializing in energy and marine engineering projects - though it hires in large numbers of contractors when it secures work. 
""It's a sad day. I don't know what I'm going to do,"" said a 54-year-old worker with 38 years of service at the plant, who declined to give his name. He said he understood all workers had been given notice of redundancy. 
The workers locked themselves into the yard last week and are taking turns occupying key buildings in a bid to take control of a process they fear will deprive them of their jobs. They were due to vote on Monday on whether to continue the protest. 
John McDonnell, finance spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, visited the yard on Monday and called for the state to step in and renationalize it. 
""It would not be difficult today for (Prime Minister) Boris Johnson to say he will give this yard a future,"" McDonnell said. ""If you close now you lose the skills, you lose the future"".
A British government spokesman last week said the fate of the yard, which was state-owned from 1975 to 1989, was a commercial issue.
Susan Fitzgerald, an official at trade union Unite, said she was concerned by media reports that the yard might be sold by administrators without liabilities such as pensions and workers' contracts, adding: ""This would be a cynical move designed to jettison jobs and workers."" 
The drilling rig business of Dolphin Drilling was restructured in late June, allowing those operations to continue under a new holding company incorporated in Jersey. 
TITANIC MUSEUM
While administration would put jobs at risk, it would not necessarily lead to the closure of the shipyard, much of whose land is on a long lease from the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. 
Part of the site has been sold and hosts a museum dedicated to Titanic, the largest floating vessel of its time which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 with the loss of 1,500 lives. 
A four-star hotel recently opened in the building in which the ship was designed.
Lawmaker Gavin Robinson, who represents the East Belfast constituency where the plant is situated, said his Democratic Unionist Party had ""pulled all the political levers that we can"" but had failed to avert the appointment of administrators.
Many in Belfast see the yard, whose workforce for much of its history was almost exclusively Protestant, as an emblem of Northern Ireland's bitter sectarian divide. 

The city is still recovering from three decades of violence between Catholic Irish nationalists seeking a united Ireland and pro-British unionists seeking to maintain Northern Ireland's British status, in which over 3,600 people died.

(Reuters) - Perkins & Marie Callender's Holding LLC, operator of two family and casual dining chains, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday and plans to sell most of its assets, after suffering from lower customer traffic and rising food and labor costs.
The Chapter 11 filing is the second in eight years for the Memphis-based company, which has nearly 400 stores under the Perkins and Marie Callender's brands in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Its 2011 reorganization left it under the control of the investment firm Wayzata Investment Partners, still its majority owner. Thirty-two underperforming restaurants are being closed, but the company plans to operate normally while it restructures.
Many dining chains have struggled to fill seats because of heavy competition and a desire among many customers for newer, fresher food options.
 Kona Grill  (PK:KONAQ), which specializes in American cuisine and sushi, filed for bankruptcy in April, while the parents of Bertucci's pizza chain and the El Torito and Chevys Fresh Mex chains sought protection last year.
In a court filing, Chief Executive Jeffrey Warne said falling sales ""across the family-dining and casual-dining industries"" in 2017 and 2018, ""elevated"" commodity prices, rising minimum wages and ""an increasingly tight labor market"" were factors leading to the bankruptcy of Perkins & Marie Callender's.
Warne said Perkins Group LLC will be a ""stalking horse"" bidder to buy Perkins assets and some of its Foxtail bakery assets at a court-supervised auction next month. He said talks are ongoing for Marie Callender's and other Foxtail assets.
The company had no immediate additional comment.
Warne said that following the closures, the company will own or franchise 355 Perkins restaurants and 28 Marie Callender's restaurants.
Perkins was founded in 1958, and Marie Callender's in 1948. They merged in 2006, and recently had about 5,379 employees.
The case is In re Perkins & Marie Callender's LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 19-11743.

848,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 10:11AM ET</span>","Google pledges carbon-neutral shipping, recycled plastic for all devices","By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google on Monday announced that it would neutralize carbon emissions from delivering consumer hardware by next year and include recycled plastic in each of its products by 2022.
The new commitments step up the competition among tech companies aiming to show consumers and governments that they are curbing the environmental toll from their widening arrays of gadgets.
Anna Meegan, head of sustainability for Google's devices and services unit, said in an interview that the company's transport-related carbon emissions per unit fell 40% last year compared to 2017 by relying more on ships instead of planes to move phones, speakers, laptops and other gadgets from factories to customers across the world.
The company will offset remaining emissions by purchasing carbon credits, Meegan said.
Three out of nine Google products for which the company has detailed disclosures online contain recycled plastic, ranging from 20% to 42% in the casings for its Google Home speakers and Chromecast streaming dongles.
In a blog post, Google committed to introducing some recycled plastic to 100% of products by 2022.
Meegan acknowledged that Google's 3-year-old hardware business trails far larger hardware rival Apple Inc (O:AAPL) in some sustainability efforts.
Apple, which in 2017 committed to ""one day"" only using recycled and renewable materials, has at least 50% recycled plastic in some parts of several products, recycled tin in at least 11 products and recycled aluminum in at least two.
But sustainability standards are now a part of Google's hardware planning, Meegan said. Devices cannot clear the second checkpoint in the company's design process unless they show that sustainable packaging and materials and ease of repair have been considered.
""We are fundamentally looking to build sustainability into everything we do,"" she said. ""It's going to take us time to demonstrate progress."""

861,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 08:54AM ET</span>","China Retaliation Is ‘11’ on Scale of 1 to 10, Wall Street Warns","(Bloomberg) -- Analysts continued to warn about the dangers of an escalating trade war on Monday, as China moved to strike back at the U.S., hitting U.S. equity futures and Treasury yields.
Semiconductors, with direct exposure to trade, and banks stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, were among the worst-performing groups. The biggest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., shed more than 2% in pre-market trading. Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). fell 3.2% while Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc. lost 1.5% and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). was down 2.1%.
President Trump tweeted about China and the Fed on Monday morning, saying: “China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It’s called ‘currency manipulation.’ Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!”
Here’s a sample of some of the latest commentary:
Cowen, Chris Krueger
Krueger called China’s retaliation “massive,” adding that “on a scale of 1-10, it’s an 11.” He cited the Chinese government calling on state buyers to halt U.S. agricultural purchases, while there’s “increased anecdotal evidence that the Chinese government is tightening its overview of foreign firms.”
“While there were measures that could have been chosen with larger direct effects on supply chains, the announcements from Beijing represent a direct shot at the White House and seem designed for maximum political impact,” Krueger said. “ We expect a quick (and possibly intemperate) response from the White House, and consequently expect a more rapid escalation of trade tensions.”
“There now will be increased expectations that the Fed will cut again in September to offset the drag caused by this escalation in the trade war,” he added. “Such moves will only be a partial, lagged offset to the recessionary headwinds a cycle of retaliation would cause.”
BMO, Ian Lyngen
“The wait is over for those wondering how Beijing would respond to Trump’s recent tariff announcement,” BMO said. “The result: the yuan was allowed to depreciate well beyond 7.0.”
Instructing state-owned Chinese firms to halt U.S. crop purchases triggered “the obligatory flight-to-quality,” which pushed 10-year yields to 1.74%, with two-year yields keeping pace. That was “an impressive move that suggests August will not experience the traditional summer doldrums. Who needs vacation anyway?”
“The most significant unknown at this moment,” Lyngen added, “is how much further the yuan will be allowed to fall given that it’s already the weakest since 2008.”
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Betsy Graseck (bank analyst)
Bank investors’ eyes were “glued to the yield curve last week,” with Trump’s tariff tweet on Thursday, Graseck wrote in a note. They’re now asking about Morgan Stanley’s net interest margin (NIM), outlook.
Graseck didn’t change her NIM assumptions -- yet. “We bake one additional cut of 25 basis points in 2019 in-line with our economist, and bake in the 10-year at 1.75% by mid 2020,” she wrote. She’ll update NIM and earnings per share estimates “if it looks like these trade tariffs are going through as September approaches.”
Morgan Stanley, Michael Zezas (policy strategist)
“The dynamics of U.S.-China negotiation and macro conditions mean the next round of tariffs will likely be enacted, and investors are likely to behave as if further escalation will follow in 2019 until markets price in impacts,” Zezas wrote. “This supports our core view of weaker growth and skews the Fed dovish.”
Zezas sees incentives for the U.S. to escalate quickly. If the administration “understands the Fed’s trade policy reaction function, then it may also perceive that a more rapid escalation could deliver one or more of three beneficial points ahead of the 2020 election: 1) A quicker, potentially more aggressive Fed stimulus response that could help the economy heading into the election; 2) More time to re-frame the potential economic downside; and 3) A major concession by China (not our base case, but it is, of course, a possibility).”"

Wall Street is bracing for an ugly open after a Monday sell-off in risk assets swept across Asia and spilled over to Europe. With European stocks poised for their worst two-day drop in three years and investors charging into safer assets, the turnover of S&P 500 futures is spiking as traders gird for the next phase of the rout.
The cause of all this is yet again the trade war. Bloomberg reported that the Chinese government has asked its state-owned enterprises to suspend purchases of U.S. agricultural products, the latest move in a protectionist flare-up that has quickly erased any talk about the “everything rally” of 2019. The Asian nation’s currency also weakened past 7 per dollar amid speculation Beijing is allowing the yuan to depreciate to counter President Donald Trump’s tariff threats.
“I bought too early last week and it was a mistake,” said Guillermo Hernandez Sampere, head of trading at asset manager MPPM EK, who bought European stocks on Thursday and suffered losses. “The sell-off burned my fingers last week. Both I and markets are in a very bad mood.”
Nonetheless, Sampere says he’s buying again as he takes advantage of the rout.
Futures on the benchmark U.S. equity gauge slumped as much as 1.6%, and were 1.3% lower as of 8 a.m. in New York. West Texas crude dropped to about $55 per barrel, gold surged and 10-year Treasury yields slid to their lowest since October 2016 on a closing basis.
“I think investors are now really scared for the first time since the beginning of the year,” said Alberto Tocchio, chief investment officer at Colombo Wealth SA, who is currently looking at European oil stocks as a possible buying opportunity. “The great performance for this year is already behind us and the aim for the next months is to take a defensive stance in order to preserve the positive performance.”
Volatility in both European and U.S. stocks on Monday certainly hinted at signs of panic not seen since the start of the year, when markets were recovering from the violent fourth-quarter sell-off. Both the CBOE VIX Index and Europe’s VSTOXX gauge surged to January highs on a closing basis.
The biggest gainers among U.S. exchange-traded funds with more than $500 million in assets also signaled that investors are bracing for a jump in price swings and further declines. The VelocityShares Daily two-times leveraged VIX fund gained 13% and ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures was up 10% in pre-market trading.
The threat to global growth from the trade spat and the yuan’s devaluation are reverberating across the world. Emerging-market equities tumbled, taking their losing streak to a ninth day -- the longest since December 2015.
The search for safety was most prominent in Japan, where the yen hit its strongest level since early January and 10-year government bond yields touched the lowest since July 2016.
“The U.S.’s imposition of the fourth round of tariffs on Chinese goods may indeed prove to be a game changer,” said Masanari Takada, a cross-asset quant strategist at Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., citing the potential damage to market fundamentals."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Indian unit Flipkart is set to roll out a free video service for all of its 160 million customers this month as the ecommerce company looks for new ways to increase its user base in smaller towns and cities, it said on Monday.
""Most consumers' first touch point with the internet is through online video content and statistics suggest that video content and entertainment play a key role in bridging the gap for consumers to come online and experience ecommerce,"" a company spokeswoman told Reuters by phone.
Flipkart, based in the southern city of Bengaluru, said it would offer movies, short videos and web series on its app, but added it won't venture into original content right now.
Access to affordable smartphones and cheap internet has made India a growth market for online streaming companies. Locked in a pitched battle for market share in the country, ecommerce firms are looking past bigger cities like Mumbai, New Delhi and Bengaluru for the next wave of growth.
Flipkart competes with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Indian unit in the country. Unlike Amazon's Prime video service, Flipkart won't charge users for streaming and won't launch a separate application for these services, the spokeswoman said.
""We have rolled out the test in among 1% of our customers currently and plan to take it to 100% of them in the next 20 days,"" she added.
Bloomberg reported https://bloom.bg/31mb92q earlier that Flipkart was planning the launch, citing people familiar with the plans. The report said Flipkart would license content from production houses like Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and local studio Balaji Telefilms.

865,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 07:48AM ET</span>",HSBC axes CEO Flint after only 18 months in role to speed up growth,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) ousted John Flint as chief executive after just 18 months in a shock move the chairman of Europe's biggest bank said was needed to speed up progress on priority areas such as the turnaround of its U.S. business.
The CEO's exit was a result of differences of opinion with chairman Mark Tucker over Flint's more tentative approach to cutting expenses and setting revenue targets for senior managers to boost profit growth, a person familiar with the matter said.
HSBC disclosed the departure of Flint, 51, alongside its half-year results on Monday as it forecast a gloomier outlook for its business, with an escalation of a trade war between China and the United States, an easing monetary policy cycle, unrest in its key Hong Kong market and Brexit.
HSBC, which makes more than 80% of its profit in Asia, said that its global commercial banking unit head Noel Quinn will be interim chief executive.
Shares in HSBC, which fell nearly 14% during Flint's tenure, were down 1.7% in London at 1111 GMT, even though it reported a 16% rise in profit and a revealed a share buyback of up to $1 billion.
Flint, who previously ran London-headquartered HSBC's retail and wealth management business, was chosen as CEO in February 2018 in the first major decision by Tucker, who told Reuters:
""It's the right time for change, and doing it clearly and decisively from a position of strength is very important.""
A key difference with Tucker was over Flint's efforts to turn around HSBC's under-performing U.S. business, the person familiar with the matter said. HSBC declined to comment. 
Tucker, who became HSBC's first externally appointed chairman when he joined HSBC's board in late 2017, said that the search for a new CEO, which will include both internal and external candidates, could take up to a year.
HSBC will also cut around 2% of its workforce or around 4,000 jobs this year as it seeks to reduce costs, Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson said, adding it will pay out a total of around $650-700 million in severance costs and the reductions will be biased towards senior managers.
HUAWEI HEAT
Flint's exit also followed weeks of adverse Chinese media coverage over HSBC's role in the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou.
China's Global Times ran an editorial on Friday saying it 'feels heat on Huawei CFO case', suggesting HSBC had erred in cooperating with U.S. authorities and it could face penalties.
""Our business operations in China continue as normal,"" Tucker told analysts on a conference call when asked whether the bank faced blacklisting in China over the Huawei situation.
HSBC executives at the time of his appointment saw Flint as a safe pair of hands and a natural successor to mentor and previous CEO Stuart Gulliver.
Outlining his strategy in June last year, Flint set out plans to invest $15-$17 billion in the next three years in areas including technology and China.
""We have been uninspired by the “business as usual” strategy,"" analyst Ed Firth at broker KBW said.
""We suspect that any new CEO is still more likely to be internal, but will need a more dynamic approach to improving underperforming areas of the business,"" he said. 
U.S. WOES
HSBC said it no longer expects to achieve the targeted 6% return on tangible equity (ROE) by 2020 in the U.S., where it has struggled for years to build scale and compete.
That missed U.S. goal is still below the overall group aim of getting to more than 11% ROE by 2020. 
HSBC hired  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) veteran Michael Roberts in July to head its U.S. business, in a renewed effort to turn it around.
The U.S business is not ""getting the proper returns"", HSBC's CFO Stevenson told Reuters, adding the unit has also been hit by the change in the monetary policy cycle.
HSBC's investment banking business has also struggled in recent years as it lost a string of senior executives and saw U.S. rivals cash in on booming domestic stock markets.
Revenues in HSBC's global banking and markets division fell by 3% in the first half compared with the same period last year.
REVENUE RISK
HSBC's pretax profit for the first six months of 2019 rose to $12.41 billion from $10.71 billion in the same period a year earlier, helped by a surge in retail banking and Asia revenues.
""Interest rates in the US dollar bloc are now expected to fall rather than rise, and geopolitical issues could impact a significant number of our major markets,"" HSBC said.
The U.S.-China trade war has taken its toll on trade-focused banks like HSBC and rival  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN), which last week warned of an impact on its business customers from the escalating tensions.
Tucker played down the impact of protests in Hong Kong against an extradition bill which have evolved into a broader anti-government backlash and said HSBC remained confident about the future of the Asian financial center.
Analysts had been watching closely to see whether the bank would announce a fresh buyback, as a failure to do so would have been read as a sign of mounting caution by HSBC's management.

Prior to the latest buyback announcement, HSBC had purchased more than $6 billion of its own shares since 2016.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 07:42AM ET</span>","Share buyback juggernaut to roll on, oiled by bond yield collapse","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Relentlessly falling borrowing costs worldwide may be setting the stage for a further squeeze in global equity supply, with signs that more companies, especially in Japan and Europe, will exploit the cheap money wave to buy back shares.
Rock-bottom borrowing costs in the decade after the global financial crisis have already played a role in draining the world of investable equity through share buybacks, mergers and acquisitions and de-listings.
With not enough shares issued to offset those withdrawn from circulation, equity supply has shrunk steadily, one reason for record share gains in recent years - especially in the United States, where 80% of firms are estimated to conduct buybacks.
The result is that net global equity supply should be around zero this year, the same as in 2017 and 2018, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicts. Net supply was negative in 2016 for the first time ever.
The buyback boom is one side-effect of rock-bottom interest rates. And with central banks again in rate-cutting mode, the trend could get a fresh lease of life.
""If you look at the cost of equity versus the cost of debt, the incentive to issue debt and buy back equity has never been higher,"" said Supriya Menon, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management.
Cost of equity is what shareholders demand as returns, while cost of debt is what a company pays to borrow. To source capital where it is cheapest, companies tend to arbitrage between equity and debt - and these days the collapse in bond yields makes it far more alluring to borrow than to list equity.
Menon highlighted an ""exceptionally wide"" gap between the yield on investment grade European and U.S. companies' 12-month forward earnings and the average yield on their bonds.

(For a graphic on 'The cost of capital: Debt versus equity', click https://tmsnrt.rs/2MyzRZ4)
(Debt versus equity interactive https://tmsnrt.rs/2Mw7OJL)
JPMorgan says a flurry of high-profile stock market debuts this year from the likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) will not materially change the net supply picture; its data shows listings worldwide are down 20-30% year-to-date while buybacks should clock in around $1 trillion over the course of 2019.
""Buybacks are still tracking record levels and you don't have that many IPOs, so you get negative net equity issuance. That's been a major driver of equity performance and I don't see any let-up,"" Pictet's Menon said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) meanwhile predicted Wall Street would enjoy its best year since 2013, even as it cut earnings estimates.
JOINING THE PARTY
U.S. buybacks have lost some momentum, perhaps as the impact of massive tax cuts fades. New stock buybacks averaged just $2.8 billion daily in the last three weeks, according to Trim Tabs Research, the second-lowest volume in the past eight earnings seasons. The number of announcements stood at 3.1, the lowest in the past eight earnings seasons.
Instead, it's Europe that's ripe for a buyback wave, analysts say.
Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, market strategist at JPMorgan notes European share buybacks last year equated to just 1% of market capitalization versus around 4% in the United States.
With German benchmark bond yields, the main reference rate for euro debt - crumbling more than 70 basis points this year to around minus 0.5% - corporate borrowing costs have collapsed by two-thirds , offering companies a unique opportunity to embrace the buyback culture.
""It is attractive for European companies to issue debt or take out bank loans for buybacks and they could have been doing it for years. It's similar in Japan, they have been enjoying zero interest rates for even longer,"" Panigirtzoglou said.
In fact, net European buybacks amounted to $100 billion in the past year,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) calculates, a record high run-rate, even if dwarfed by last year's roughly $800 billion U.S. tally.
(For a graphic on 'buybacks', click https://tmsnrt.rs/2OcX0mo)
Morgan Stanley advised European firms to cut dividends and conduct buybacks instead.
""The much lower level of corporate bond yields should provide for a decent 'refinancing bonus' as companies swap out their old debt and re-issue new bonds at today's very low yield levels,"" it said.
There are also signs that Japanese firms, notoriously stingy with buybacks, are joining the party: Buybacks hit a record 6.5 trillion yen-plus ($59.8 billion) in the fiscal year to April 1 2019 and Goldman Sachs predicts a further 20 percent increase in the year to April 2020.
(For a graphic on 'Japan Buyback', click https://tmsnrt.rs/2E9ABPV)
The reason buybacks have been historically less popular in Europe and Japan is that shareholders have tended to prefer dividend income. Despite last year's buyback surge in Europe shareholders earned 80% of their cash returns from dividends, according to Morgan Stanley.
But in fact, the 20% share of buybacks was a record high for Europe, the bank said, predicting several companies to deliver bigger buybacks in the coming year than expected.

LONDON (Reuters) - People in financial services jobs that have a black mark against their name at one company can still move easily to another firm and become a ""rolling bad apple"" despite efforts by Britain's finance watchdog to improve conduct in the industry.
The Financial Conduct Authority's senior managers regime, introduced in 2016, aimed to clean up behavior in the finance industry after banks were fined billions of pounds for trying to rig interest rate benchmarks and currencies.
This has tried to ""change the tone at the top"" of finance firms by making senior management directly accountable for specific activities or misdemeanors.
Firms must keep ""regulatory"" references of senior staff to make it harder for those with a history of poor conduct to switch to another company, known as ""rolling bad apples"".
""The majority felt that the industry had some way to go to improve the quality and timeliness of references,"" the FCA said in a ""stock take"" on Monday of its senior managers regime.
The FCA said firms said the ""tone at the top"" was stronger, but they were finding it hard to measure culture. They also appeared more risk averse when launching new products.
Bankers had warned the watchdog that the regime would make it harder to recruit non-executive directors and senior managers and accused regulators of wanting ""heads on sticks"" after too few individuals were punished during the 2008 financial crisis.
""Some firms told us that there was a culture of fear during the early days of the regime. However, this has now largely dissipated,"" the FCA said in its stocktake.
Regulation consultancy Bovill said a freedom of information request showed that the FCA was pursuing 19 investigations under the regime.
But only one individual,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) CEO Jes Staley, has been punished so far under the rules, when he sought to identify a whistleblower.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. activist investor Elliott [ECAL.UL] has urged German classifieds group Scout24 (DE:G24n) to sell its car listings business and ramp up a share buyback program to boost returns to investors.
Elliott, opening a new front in its broader push to shake up corporate Germany, accused Scout24 Chief Executive Tobias Hartmann of showing a lack of ambition and urged his management team to take immediate remedial action.
The $34 billion fund, founded by Paul Singer, has invested in and called for restructuring at firms ranging from software house SAP (DE:SAPG) to conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG). It has amassed a stake of more than 7% in Scout24.
""Should you take the decisive action needed to remove the impediments holding back Scout24, we believe the share price could rise to in excess of 65 euros per share,"" Elliott said in a letter published on Monday and dated July 26.
""Unfortunately, recent events have us wondering if the Scout management team shares our optimism for these high-quality businesses.""
Responding, Scout24 said it took note of Elliott's letter and would maintain a dialogue with all shareholders. Scout24 had announced steps to strengthen its core businesses and optimize its capital structure, it added in a statement.
The company's shares ended last week at 50.25 euros, giving it a market capitalization of 5.4 billion euros ($6 billion). They traded 0.6% firmer on Monday in a weaker overall market.
ImmobilienScout24 is the real-estate classifieds market leader in Germany, offering a popular smartphone app for rentals and sales. AutoScout24 - present in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria - bills itself as the largest automotive digital marketplace in the European Union.
Group revenue was up 12.5% at 532 million euros last year, while its core profit margin increased to 54.8% from 53.5%.
'LACK OF AMBITION'
A source familiar with the matter said Elliott believed that autos arm AutoScout24 could fetch a sale price of up to 2.5 billion euros while ImmobilienScout24 could command a standalone valuation of 5 billion euros.
In targeting Scout24, where it is one of the largest shareholders, Elliott is focusing on a company that has faced uncertainty since a takeover bid by Blackstone (N:BX) and Hellman & Friedman collapsed this year.
The public tender offer by the two private equity houses, at 46 euros a share, failed to win the support of a majority of shareholders in spite of the company's management recommending acceptance.
In its letter, Elliott accused Hartmann of ""a lack of ambition that, for a listed company of Scout24's quality and prospects, is extremely worrying"". It was published a little more than a week before Scout24 publishes second-quarter results on Aug. 13.
Elliott also said that a 300 million euro share buyback program announced by Scout24 last month was insufficient and the company could support a far larger return of capital to investors with the use of higher debt.
STRATEGIC INTEREST
Elliott also said that two strategic investors and several sponsors had shown interest in AutoScout24, without naming them.
The source said that German publisher  Axel Springer  (DE:SPRGn) and used-car platform AUTO1 Group, which is backed by Japan's Softbank (T:9984), had shown interest in AutoScout24.
Separately, Axel Springer said that a friendly offer by U.S. private equity house KKR (N:KKR) to buy out its minority shareholders had reached the necessary minimum 20% threshold to succeed.
Springer's main shareholders, Friede Springer and CEO Mathias Doepfner, are acting in concert with KKR in a move to take the publisher private and pursue growth investments away from the gaze of public equity markets.
A Springer spokeswoman said it was premature to comment on possible acquisitions. AUTO1 also declined to comment.

The Zurich-based company last month shelved its plans for a $4.1 billion flotation of ReAssure, citing weak demand from institutional investors.
The acquisition showed  Swiss Re  remained ""fully supportive of ReAssure as the company continues to pursue its growth strategy,"" Thierry Leger, Chief Executive of Swiss Re's Life Capital Business said in a statement on Monday.
The purchase helps bulk up Swiss Re's closed book business, which deals in policies that are shut to new customers and where scale is important to generate profit.
It will add over 200,000 customer policies and 12 billion pounds of assets to ReAssure's platform, Swiss Re said.
Wealth manager Quilter, spun out of Anglo-South African insurance company Old Mutual last year, announced the sale as it published its first-half results showing pre-tax losses of 32 million pounds, compared to a profit of 2 million pounds in the first half of 2018, partly due to a one-off charge from the split with Old Mutual.
Adjusted profit rose 5% to 115 million pounds from 110 million in the first half of 2018, while assets under management and administration rose by 1.6% to 118.4 billion pounds.
The business Reassure is buying consists of Old Mutual Wealth Life Assurance Limited and its subsidiary Old Mutual Wealth Pensions Trustees Limited and includes about 300 employees.
The transaction will increase ReAssure's total policy count to 4.5 million and assets under administration to 81 billion pounds, Swiss Re said.
The world's second largest reinsurer had wanted to spin off ReAssure to put the business under a more favorable regulatory regime and give it easier access to capital to fund its expansion.
The flotation has now been put on ice until at least next year, with Swiss Re saying long-term options remained open.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Flex Ltd (O:FLEX), a contract manufacturer for Huawei that is locked in a dispute with the Chinese tech giant over about $100 million worth of assets, said the market situation was affecting some of its jobs in the Asian nation.
Chinese financial magazine Caixin reported late on Sunday that some 10,000 Flex jobs in China were expected to be cut as two major factories in Changsha and Zhuhai had stopped work due to its row with Huawei.
While declining to comment on the report, a Flex spokesman said ""after careful review of the market situation and customer need, we are offering impacted employees job opportunities within Flex Zhuhai Industrial Park and other Flex locations"".
He declined to say how many employees had been affected but denied it was a layoff. A Flex source said the firm employs some 50,000 people in China, with Zhuhai being its largest base.
Huawei last month said Flex had withheld some 700 million yuan ($100 million) worth of Huawei goods in its Zhuhai factory after Washington put Huawei on a trade blacklist in mid-May, causing losses for the Chinese company.
At the time, Flex had said it was ""actively working"" with Huawei ""to find a mutually agreeable way forward"" after their partnership had ""recently been impacted by unforeseen challenges resulting from the US/China trade situation"".
Dual-headquartered in the United States and Singapore, Flex is among the world's largest electronics manufacturers and competes against Foxconn Technology (TW:2354) in providing manufacturing services for Huawei products such as smartphones and 5G base stations.

The move comes after Japan on Friday dropped Korea from its ""white list"" of countries with fast-track export status, intensifying a row over wartime forced laborers..
In July, Japan tightened controls on the export of materials used to make chips, South Korea's top export item, which threatened to disrupt global semiconductor supplies used by tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Huawei.
""We want to turn the crisis into an opportunity for the materials, parts and equipment industry,"" South Korea's industry minister, Sung Yun-mo, said at a press briefing.
South Korea plans to raise ""self-sufficiency"" for 100 key components, materials and equipment items used to make chips, displays, batteries, automobiles and other products, with a goal to stabilize supply over the next five years.
The plan aims to ""address structural weakness in South Korea's materials, parts and equipment sector, which heavily depends on a particular country,"" the government said in a statement.
In a 51-page statement, South Korea also laid out a number of measures, including financing support of over 2.5 trillion won for overseas acquisitions.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Sales of Japanese-branded autos in South Korea slumped in July amid a worsening diplomatic row between the two countries that has led to consumer boycotts and efforts by Seoul to cut the economy's reliance on imports from Japan.
Industry data out of South Korea on Monday showed Toyota Motor (T:7203) sales in the country tumbled 32% from a year earlier while Honda's (T:7267) sales skidded 34%.
Although automakers are still assessing the main factors driving the declines last month, industry participants and analysts expect an intensifying boycott campaign to hurt demand further, as diplomatic tensions grow.
Japan tightened controls in July on exports to South Korea, escalating a row over wartime forced laborers and sparking a boycott by South Korean consumers of Japanese products and services, from cars, beer and pens to tours.
On Friday, Japan escalated tensions by removing South Korea from a list of export destinations approved for fast-track status.
""Showroom visits are declining while consumers are holding off on signing contracts,"" a Honda Korea official told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
South Korean representatives for Honda and Toyota did not provide any commentary on the sales trends and said they would need to assess the reasons for the decline.
However, industry watchers said public sentiment was a factor behind the sharp falls.
""The South Korean public is angry about Japan...It will soon become a taboo to drive a Japanese cars in Korea,"" Daelim University College automotive engineering Professor Kim Pil-so said.
The data from the Korea Automobile Importers & Distributors Association (KAIDA) also showed Lexus, Toyota's luxury badge and the third-most imported brand into South Korea after Mercedes and BMW, saw sales down 25% from the previous month, although they were still up 33% from the previous year.
Japanese officials have cited unspecified security reasons for the export curbs to South Korea. But they have also pointed to an erosion of trust after South Korean court rulings last year ordered Japanese firms to compensate wartime forced laborers, a matter Tokyo says was settled by a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral ties.
South Korean shares fell more than 2% on Monday, tracking broader moves in Asia as the Sino-U.S. trade war intensified but also weighed by uncertainty over the diplomatic dispute between Seoul and Tokyo.
SELF-SUFFICIENT
Earlier on Monday, South Korea's government announced plans to invest about 7.8 trillion won ($6.48 billion) in research and development for local materials, parts and equipment over the next seven years in an effort to cut the reliance on Japanese imports.
South Korea plans to improve economic ""self-sufficiency"" in regards to the production of 100 key components, materials and equipment items used to make chips, displays, batteries, automobiles and other products. The government aims to stabilize supply of these items over the next five years.
While foreign-branded cars make up a small portion of domestic auto sales in South Korea, the business community is concerned a consumer swing away from Japanese imports for political reasons could grow in other sectors, like tourism and retail.
Japan's Fast Retailing (T:9983) fashion brand Uniqlo has been a prime target for the boycott, with its 186 stores in South Korea making the country its second biggest overseas market in terms of outlets.
Fast Retailing chief financial officer Takeshi Okazaki last month acknowledged there had been some impact on its sales as a result of the campaign, without elaborating.
Japan's Asahi Group Holdings (T:2502), whose Asahi Super Dry is the most popular import brand in South Korea, said on Thursday the boycott had hit its beer sales as it lowered its profit guidance slightly."

DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) Chief Executive has a message for  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and other would-be partners: We are happy to talk, but we can go it alone.
""Strategically, we have a solid future and clear plans that are being invested in and are underway now,"" Mike Manley said during a session with reporters the day after the company released better than expected second-quarter results.
""That isn't to say if there is a better future through an alliance or partnership or merger we wouldn’t be open and interested to it.""
Fiat Chrysler is open to re-starting merger negotiations with French automaker Renault, Manley said, but added the French car maker is not the only potential partner to gain scale or plug gaps in Fiat Chrysler's technology or vehicle lineup.
""To say are they the only opportunity, the answer to that question would be a definitive ‘No,’"" Manley said.
Fiat Chrysler in June withdrew a $35 billion merger proposal with Renault after French government officials intervened in the talks and sought to delay a decision on the deal.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Renault and Nissan are trying again to reshape their alliance and resolve disagreements that helped to derail the merger talks with Fiat Chrysler.
Fiat Chrysler has a commercial vehicle partnership with French rival  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP), and the two companies discussed a broader combination before Fiat Chrysler made its offer to Renault, people familiar with the situation have said.
Manley said automakers are not the only potential partners.
""There are cooperations that can help in specific technologies. There are cooperations as we think about the consumer-car interface,"" he said. ""You could see collaborations that never would be there in the past.""
Fiat Chrysler's North American business is strong thanks to Ram trucks and Jeep SUVs, but in other markets the automaker faces continued challenges.
The company is overhauling its mass-market business in Europe, which is anchored by the Fiat brand. Fiat Chrysler's Europe, Middle East and Africa operations were marginally profitable in the second quarter and achieved 1.8% profit margin in 2018. Manley has set a goal of 3% operating margins, well short of the 10% margins the company forecast for North America.
Fiat Chrysler can improve profitability in Europe by expanding the Jeep sport utility vehicle lineup, launching a redesigned Fiat 500 line, including electric and hybrid models, and adding larger vehicles to the Fiat brand, Manley said.
""We have the oldest fleet in Europe,"" in the Fiat brand, Manley said.
Increasing the number of cars produced per worker in Italy and reducing the ranks of Italian hourly workers, Manley said. But in the short term, Manley said he is prepared to sacrifice sales volume to increase margins.
""Margins in Europe are absolutely critical as we go through the next three to five years,"" he said.
A deal to pool emissions credits with Silicon Valley electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) gives Fiat Chrysler strategic options for managing rising emissions compliance costs, Manley said.
In China, Manley said the restructuring of Fiat Chrysler's alliance with joint venture partner GAC Group is reducing costs. The venture needs to add more Jeep models, he said. ""We only have three vehicles localized,"" Manley said.
A third challenge for Fiat Chrysler is reviving the Maserati premium brand, which lost money through the first half of 2019, in part because of writedowns related to underperforming leases. The company has said it plans to sell down inventories of Maseratis during the remainder of this year.
An overhaul of Maserati's product line will begin with the debut of a new model at the 2020 Geneva auto show, Manley said."

OSAKA (Reuters) - There's a sense of panic within Japan Inc and the government - the world's No. 3 economy doesn't have enough experts in artificial intelligence and it's time to do something about it.
SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) CEO Masayoshi Son last month bemoaned the state of play, calling Japan a 'developing country' in the most important current tech revolution.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in June unveiled a plan to train 250,000 people in AI skills annually by 2025, albeit one criticized as unrealistic due to a shortage of teachers. Tech heavyweights like Sony Corp (T:6758) are hiking pay for the right hires and boosting recruitment of foreign engineers.
But Daikin Industries Ltd (T:6376), the world's biggest maker of air conditioners with a market value of $37 billion, is taking a more unusual route to AI expertise.
At a disadvantage to bigger tech firms in attracting top talent, it has created an in-house program that takes new graduates and current employees - almost all with no AI background - and trains them up.
It aims to make 1,000 employees AI-savvy by 2022, in what Daikin says is one of the most ambitious AI-specific training programs by a Japanese company.
""We have a sense of crisis as we don't have experts well-versed in information technology when AI and data analysis are in great demand,"" Yuji Yoneda, executive officer at Daikin's Technology and Innovation Center, told Reuters.
Daikin sees AI as essential to its future business model, in which it plans to offer subscription services with AI-powered air conditioners adjusting the temperature and quality of air autonomously to improve efficiency in factories and households.
""Just as car makers are promoting the concept of mobility as a service, we will promote air as a service by providing various services related to air,"" he said.
New hires get the most training with a two-year program. The first crop of 100 graduates hired last year took classes given by Osaka University professors for about six months, with the rest of their first year spent on data analysis and group work. This year, they have been assigned to various departments for on-the-job AI training.
Daikin declined to comment on the cost of its program.
By comparison, Sony offers its engineers 290 courses, including AI-courses, that range from a few hours to several days.
Daikin is also keen to hire more engineers from India and China but says its struggles in the United States where it needs to offer hundreds of thousands of dollars to attract the graduates it wants. Additionally, it is looking at raising pay for AI experts to keep them loyal to the company.
LAGGING JAPAN
Japan's AI woes can be overstated. Of the top 20 companies in AI patents, 12 are Japanese, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization's 2019 report on technology trends. These include Toshiba, NEC Corp (T:6701), Panasonic Corp (T:6752), Sony and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203).
But compared to the United States, which issued a national AI development plan in 2016, and China which unveiled plans in 2017 to become a global leader in AI by 2025, Japan is lagging.
Combined Japanese government and corporate investment in information and communication technology was 16.3 trillion yen ($150 billion) in 2017, up 12% from 1994, Japanese government data showed. By contrast, U.S. investment in the sector more than tripled over the same period to $655 billion.
Japanese universities have also come under fire for not doing enough in AI and data science education. The industry ministry estimates Japan had a shortage of 220,000 IT workers in 2018, which could deepen to 790,000 in 2030 - a prediction that was part of the impetus for Abe's plan to train 250,000 people in AI annually.
In contrast, the World Intellectual Property Organization report noted that Chinese organizations make up 17 of the top 20 academic players in AI patenting.
LIFTING PAY
Hitoshi Matsubara, vice president of Future University Hakodate and an expert in AI, says Japan needs to invest more, make IT jobs more attractive and shake off the mindset that most employees of the same age should be treated equally.
""In Japan, IT jobs have long been thought of as labor-intensive with low pay and late-night work. If they are as well-paid and rewarding as in the United States and China, information science would become more popular among students,"" he said.
That is starting to change.
This year, Sony began to offer starting salaries of up to 7.3 million yen for postgraduates proficient in areas such as AI, compared with its standard starting salary of 6 million yen. Toshiba also overhauled its pay system, allowing it to offer bigger salaries to people with expertise in AI and the Internet of Things.
Chat app operator Line Corp (T:3938), which is diversifying into fintech and AI, also boosted annual pay to top graduates to as much as 8 million yen compared to 5.5 million yen for lower-skilled engineers. It is also a heavy recruiter of foreign engineers, who account for 37% of its 670 engineers in Japan.
Sony too is casting its net wider, with favored recruitment grounds including Carnegie Mellon University, Tsinghua University and Indian Institute of Technology.
""Competition in hiring IT talent - whether new grads, mid-career and foreign workers - is getting tougher and tougher,"" says Kazunari Ikeyama, a manager in Sony's human resources division. ""We're broadening our focus, not just in Japan but also globally.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. broadcaster  Fox Corp  (O:FOXA) on Monday agreed to buy  Credible Labs  Inc (AX:CRD) in a deal valuing the online finance broker at $397 million, as the Murdoch-controlled firm hunts for growth following the sale of its film and TV assets to  Disney .
In a challenging media landscape, the San-Francisco-based Credible Labs, listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, gives Fox exposure to an online service that matches personal borrowers and lenders seeking to service the $1.6 trillion a year U.S. mortgage market.
""The acquisition of Credible underscores Fox Corporation's innovative digital strategy that emphasizes direct interactions with our consumers,"" Lachlan Murdoch, Fox Corp's executive chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
Credible's online platform provides credit checks to borrowers seeking mortgages and student and personal loans, and uses that information to show them pre-qualified loan rates and refinancing options that they can click through to obtain.
The fintech company had synergies with FOX Business and FOX Television businesses and would join its FOX Sports app, live and on demand content and FOX Now, Fox said, which would help both companies to grow.
Rupert Murdoch's newly spun-off media company Fox Corp debuted on the Nasdaq in March following the $71 billion sale of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's film and television assets to Walt Disney Co (N:DIS).
The smaller firm now relies on costly live cable sports and news in an increasingly competitive television industry.
PREMATURE SALE
Credible said its shareholders will receive A$2.21 in cash per CHESS depository interest (CDI), valuing it at A$585 million less than two years after it listed in Australia at just over half that value.
Fox's offer price represents a 7% premium to its last close of A$2.06 on August 2.
Majority shareholder, founder and Chief Executive Stephen Dash would remain head of the new Fox subsidiary and would exchange shares equal to one-third of Credible's outstanding common stock into units of a newly created Fox subsidiary.
The transaction is subject to shareholder approval. Credible's board of directors - who own a combined 13% of shares in the company - unanimously backed the proposal.
Some minority shareholders were surprised by the approach and feared missing out on the potential growth of the company if they sell now, said Bell Potter analyst Damien Williamson, who values Credible at A$2.78 per share.
""Premature is the word to describe how some minority shareholders see the transaction,"" said Williamson. ""This company is operating in a very large market and has the potential to do really well.""
Williamson said there was potential for Credible's larger American rivals, such as Lendingtree Inc (O:TREE), to launch competing bids for the company.
Shares in Credible rose 6.3% percent to A$2.19 in a broader market (AXJO) that was down 1.8%.

The yuan slipped below 7 per U.S. dollar for the first time since 2008 at one stage. Even though the People’s Bank of China set the daily midpoint of the currency's trading band at 6.9225 per dollar, the onshore yuan market is so tightly controlled as to give the day's trading range a quasi-official seal of approval.
The moves come only days after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed another 10% tariffs on the remainder of all U.S. imports of Chinese goods, worth about $300 billion. Trump has often accused China of weakening its currency to make exports cheaper and getting an unfair advantage in trade, which Beijing denies.

886,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Markets Rout as China Hints at Currency War,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets faced a test of nerve on Monday – and resoundingly flunked it.
Markets succumbed to a general rout after China allowed its currency to fall below the closely-watched level of 7 to the dollar for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, a move aimed at neutralizing the effect of U.S. tariffs on Chinese corporate profitability. Beijing also instructed state buyers to stop buying U.S. agricultural produce for good measure.
China’s step raises the risk of competitive devaluations elsewhere in a “race to the bottom”, not least in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has railed relentlessly against what he perceives to be the dollar’s overvaluation and the Federal Reserve’s unwillingness to end it by loosening monetary policy. 
In signaling the breakdown of talks between the two countries on trade, it also makes it more likely that the 10% tariff hike on U.S. imports of some $300 billion worth of Chinese goods will come into force in September, as threatened last week by Trump. At the very least, it pushes back the day when the U.S. and China settle a trade dispute that has battered Europe’s export-sensitive blue-chip boards.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 2.0% at a two-month low of 370.40, while the German Dax was down 1.6%, while the FTSE 100 was down 2.1% and the Italian FTSE MIB down 1.5%
For the most part, it was those with the biggest exposure to China and the U.S. that led the way down. Plant hire group Ashtead (LON:AHT), a rough proxy for U.S. business investment, fell 4.6%, while metals and mining groups all suffered as the prices of their most important commodities fell by as much as 8%. Copper miner   Antofagasta   (LON:ANTO) fell 3.5%, while   Anglo American   (LON:AAL) fell by 3.3%,   Glencore   (LON:GLEN) by 3.0% and   Rio Tinto   (LON:RIO) by 2.5%. By contrast,   Fresnillo   (LON:FRES) rose 4.3%, anticipating windfall gains in gold prices.
Steelmakers ArcelorMittal SA (AS:MT) and Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) fell 4.5% and 3.6% respectively, threatened by the prospect of even cheaper Chinese steel exports.
Chipmakers Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicroelectronics NV (PA:STM) and ASML (AS:ASML) all fell between 2.1% and 3.5%, while Adidas (DE:ADSGN), whose Chinese-made sportswear will be hit by the proposed new tariffs at the U.S. border, fell 3.2%.
Luxury goods makers, with their high exposure to both the Chinese and U.S. markets, were also hit badly, with Switzerland’s   Richemont   (SIX:CFR) and Swatch (SIX:UHR) both falling nearly 5%, while LVMH (PA:LVMH) fell 3.3% and   Burberry   (LON:BRBY) 3.5%. The spiraling unrest in Hong Kong, a key market for luxury sales, merely added to the general malaise.
Automotives also suffered, with components groups   Faurecia   (PA:EPED),   Valeo   (PA:VLOF) and Schaeffler (DE:SHA_p) the worst hit. The standout performer was   Renault   (PA:RENA), which rose 0.4% after restarting talks with Nissan (T:7201) about reviving their troubled strategic partnership.
But some of the biggest losers were in banks, a sector that would suffer largely second-round effects from an outright currency war between the U.S. and China.   BNP Paribas   (PA:BNPP),   Credit Agricole   (PA:CAGR) and   Natixis   (PA:CNAT) all fell over 2% on the perception that the ECB will act even more aggressively than it has signaled to stop the euro rising against the yuan and dollar. China-focused HSBC (LON:HSBA) fell even more, by 3.6%, as it ousted CEO John Flint after only 18 months."
887,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 05:05AM ET</span>","Stocks Tumble, Treasuries Surge as the Yuan Hits 7: Markets Wrap","(Bloomberg) -- European stocks slumped with U.S. equity futures on Monday, tracking a sell-off across Asia after China escalated its trade dispute with America as its currency weakened through a milestone level. Treasuries led a global bond rally as investors dashed to safer assets.
Declines in mining, industrial goods and tech shares led the Stoxx Europe 600 lower, while S&P 500 Index futures slumped as much as 1.4%. China’s yuan weakened beyond 7 per dollar, a move that suggests the level is no longer a line in the sand for policy makers in Beijing. Equities took another leg down after Bloomberg reported the Asian nation has asked state purchasers to halt imports of American agricultural products. Hong Kong shares were hit hardest amid swelling unrest in the city streets.
Havens were in demand. Gold rallied and 10-year Treasury yields dropped to their lowest since October 2016. European bonds advanced as data showed economic activity in the euro area’s private sector weakened further. The yield on 10-year U.K. gilts fell to a record low.
“The market needs a circuit-breaker,” such as a more aggressive Federal Reserve or a resumption of U.S.-China talks, Jonathan Cavenagh, head of foreign-exchange strategy for emerging markets Asia at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. in Singapore, said on Bloomberg Television. “If you see enough U.S. equity-market weakness, if you see enough downward momentum in economic data, then both sides may come back to the negotiating table at some stage. But I don’t think that’s going to happen at least in the near term.”
After a dramatic session in Asia, all focus will now be on whether President Donald Trump responds to the Monday news about China’s exchange-rate. In the past he has criticized the Asian nation for allegedly manipulating the yuan for competitive export advantage. Wall Street has also speculated about the potential for the Trump administration to intervene to cap dollar gains, though White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Friday ruled that out.
The yuan’s drop was the biggest since August 2015, when officials announced a surprise devaluation that roiled global markets. The People’s Bank of China said that it is able to keep the currency stable and at a reasonable level, and that broke above 7 per dollar because of trade protectionism.
Elsewhere, West Texas oil dropped below $55 a barrel amid the escalation in trade tensions. Other commodities came under renewed pressure, with iron ore futures in Singapore plunging the most in more than two years, to below $100 a ton.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares suffered their steepest daily drop in 10 months on Monday, as Sino-U.S. trade friction sent the yuan slumping to a more than decade trough and stampeded investors into safe harbors including the yen, bonds and gold.
The panic is likely to spread to Europe and Wall Street with futures signaling sharp losses in their benchmark indices.
The pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 (STXEc1) futures lost 1.1% in Asian trades while those of London's FTSE (FFIc1) slipped over 1% and futures for Germany's DAX (FDXc1) were down 1.25%. E-minis for the S&P 500 (ESc1) stumbled 1%.
Markets have been badly spooked since U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly declared he would slap 10% tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese imports, ending a month-long trade truce. China vowed on Friday to fight back.
In response, China's yuan burst beyond the psychological 7-per-dollar threshold in a move that threatened to unleash a whole new front in the trade hostilities - a currency war.
""Everything is selling off right now,"" said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney. ""We have no reason to expect any cessation in selling unless we see any strong action to defend any CNY or CNH weakness.""
""Our working assumption is that we are unlikely to see any meaningful resolution to the trade dispute anytime soon.""
Asian share markets were a sea of red with Japan's Nikkei (N225) shedding 1.7% to the lowest since early June. It was the sharpest daily drop since March and led Japanese officials to call a special meeting to discuss market turmoil.
Australian shares (AXJO) slipped about 2% to spend their fourth straight session in the red, and South Korea's KOSPI (KS11) tumbled 2.6% to hit its lowest since November 2016.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan sank 2.5% to depths not seen since late January. That marked the biggest one-day percentage loss since early October.In China, the blue-chip index (CSI300) fell 1% while the troubled Hong Kong market (HSI) hit a seven-month trough.
Oil prices were dragged down on demand worries, while gold climbed 0.8% to $1,452.17 an ounce.
The trade dispute between the world's two largest economies has already disrupted global supply chains and investment.
The abrupt escalation capped a critical week for global markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve delivered a widely anticipated interest rate cut and played down expectations of further easing.
EVER DEEPER CUTS
So far, investors are not buying Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's claim that the 25-basis-point rate reduction was a mere ""mid-cycle adjustment to policy"".
Futures are now pricing in deeper cuts than before last week's Fed meeting. The terminal U.S. rate is seen at 1.22%, 93 basis points below the current effective rate.
Analysts at TD Securities are forecasting no less than five more cuts from the Fed, amounting to 125 basis points of easing, over the coming year or so.
Bond markets were well ahead of the game as U.S. 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) dived 7 basis points to 1.77%, a violent shift for usually cautious Asian hours. Yields in Australia and New Zealand touched all-time lows.
German 10-year government bond yields (DE10YT=RR) dropped on Friday to an all-time low of -0.502% and the country's entire government bond yield curve turned negative for the first time ever.
The flight to safety lifted the yen, which often gains at times of stress thanks to Japan's position as the world's largest creditor. The dollar slipped to a seven-month trough of 105.77 yen , while the euro sank to its lowest since April 2017 at 117.66 yen (EURJPY=).
That dragged the dollar index (DXY) off 0.1%, though it was up against most other Asian currencies and those exposed to China or commodities including the Australian dollar.
The Aussie , a liquid proxy for emerging market and China risk, slipped to a fresh seven-month trough at $0.6748 after losing 1.6% last week.
The Swiss franc was boosted by safe-haven demand from the escalating trade tensions. Trump is also eyeing tariffs on the European Union, but is yet to make any formal announcements. The euro (EUR=) was relatively steady on the dollar at $1.1125.
Sterling hovered near 2017 lows at $1.2119, pressured by concerns about Britain exiting the European Union without a deal in place.

S&P 500 Index futures contracts expiring in September fell as much as 1.2% after China’s central bank weakened its daily currency fixing past the key level, fueling speculation that Beijing was allowing currency depreciation to counter President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat. Dow Jones Industrial Average contracts shed as much as 1%, while those on the Nasdaq 100 slipped as much as 1.5%. The S&P 500 Index closed lower Friday, in its worst week since the sell-off in December.
Losses in Asian markets intensified after Bloomberg reported that China asked its state-owned enterprises to suspend imports of U.S. agricultural products in response to Trump’s latest tariff proposal. The U.S. president on Thursday suggested adding 10% tariffs on a further $300 billion in Chinese imports from Sept. 1.

892,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 01:08AM ET</span>","Korea Leads Slide as Emerging Asia Caught in Trade, FX Crossfire","(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s won and stocks led losses in Asian emerging-market assets as trade tensions escalated and signs emerged that China was allowing currency depreciation to ward off the latest U.S. tariff threat.
The won slipped as much as 1.7% to 1,218.35 per dollar, its weakest since March 2016. Bulk of the losses came after China set its yuan fixing at a level weaker than 6.9 per dollar for the first time in 2019. The Kospi Index of shares sank 2.5%. South Korean bonds rallied, with the 3-year yield falling to a record low on bets a worsening economic outlook will prompt the central bank to ease policy again.
Pressure on South Korean assets has risen after Tokyo on Friday removed Seoul from a list of trusted export destinations, prompting the latter to say it would do the same. That’s when the export-dependent economy is already caught in the trade-war crossfire between the U.S. and China, its two major trading partners, and is also grappling with a slump in demand for memory chips. Volatility in local financial and foreign-exchange markets may rise, the Bank of Korea warned on Friday.
“Considering the weight of trade woes on the won, further escalation in disputes may weaken the currency to as low as 1,220 per dollar,” said Chang Jaechul, chief economist at KB Securities Co. The won’s drop since July reflects “the risk of growing uncertainties in the market, combined with the broad dollar rally and yuan’s weakness,” he said.

The move in the dollar-won pair is “excessive” and “abnormal,” South Korea’s FX authority said on Monday as the won fell past the key 1,200-per dollar mark for the first time since 2017.
That said, analysts say the yuan’s sudden slump is a sign the People’s Bank of China will allow more depreciation after the U.S. vowed to hit the country’s products with new tariffs, adding to the pressure on Asian currencies.
China’s weaker fixing signals more downside for regional currencies, said Qi Gao, a currency strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore.

It didn’t get any better Monday.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped as much as 2.2%, set for the worst slump this year as trade tensions escalated and the yuan hit a record low.
Let’s start with the trade war. The trade tension heightened when Trump ratcheted up his rhetoric late Friday by saying he could boost levies on China to a “much higher number.” In response, China’s government has asked state-owned enterprises to suspend imports of U.S. agricultural products, people familiar with the situation said.
Meanwhile in Hong Kong, the city’s protests also escalated with a general strike and commute disruptions. The city’s chief executive Carrie Lam condemned protesters challenging China’s sovereignty, saying they wanted to “completely ruin Hong Kong”.
The Hang Seng Index slumped as much as 3% to its lowest since January, almost wiping out gains for the year. “The ongoing protest and riot has started to erode investor confidence about the city’s future, in particular the real estate, luxury retail, tourism and even the public transportation sector,” said Margaret Yang, a market analyst at CMC Markets Singapore Pte Ltd.
Also in the region, there was no let up in the tension between Japan and South Korea, with South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon on Sunday urging Tokyo to correct its “reckless and risky” decision to curb exports to the country.
Meanwhile, market participants were readying for the week’s central bank meetings in India, Philippines, New Zealand and Australia. Click here to read Bloomberg Intelligence’s estimates on these events.
Of course one thing the more optimistic investor could pin their hopes on is further monetary support amid all the macro uncertainty. They will be happy to hear from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists including Helen Qiao, who wrote in a note that the escalation in trade tensions may lead to further policy easing in China. The team believe the PBOC will gradually pump more liquidity into the economy when needed, and it may also tolerate more currency adjustment to counter the trade shocks.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped amid a citywide strike that saw protesters blocked roads and cross-harbour tunnels, and also disrupted public transportation services to force the government to give in to demands.
The Hang Seng Index was down 3.1% by 11:01 PM ET (03:01 GMT). Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, held a press conference on Monday morning with eight other top officials and said the recent protests has put the city in a ""very dangerous situation."" Lam refused to step down, insisting that high level officials including herself ""have the responsibility to stand fast to our positions.""
The press conference came after a weekend of intense stand-offs between the police forces and protesters in multiple districts in the city, which resulted in tear gases being fired and arrests. 
In an interview with the South China Morning Post, a 20-year old unnamed university student said Lam ""is like a recorder repeating condemnations.""
“She condemns the damage of inanimate things and doesn’t care about the use of excessive police force on people. She has not responded to even one of the five demands,” he said. 
The ""five demands"" include a complete withdrawal of the highly controversial extradition bill, an inquiry into police actions over the handling of demonstrations, and the release of all arrested protestors which Lam said is ""unreasonable"" because they have clearly broken the law. 
“Every time she speaks she makes me and my friends even more furious,"" the student said. 
Tension in the city began to rise in early June when an estimated one million of citizens marched on the streets of the city against the now-abandoned extradition law.
Hong Kong’s July whole economy purchasing managers’ index plunged to 43.8 in July from 47.9 the previous month, the lowest reading since March 2009, as output and new orders both fell, according to IHS Markit.
China's Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 0.7% and 0.1% respectively. Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump has overruled his advisor teams when he ordered to slap more tariffs on Chinese goods last week.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2019 09:44AM ET</span>",How a shadow banking crisis sent India's autos sector into a tailspin,"By Swati Bhat and Nupur Anand
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Sudhir Gharpure and his sales team sat chatting at a big Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI) dealership on the outskirts of Mumbai some two hours after its doors were opened on a recent Saturday morning - not a single customer was in sight.
""There used to be close to 15-20 bookings each day, but now we're down to 3-5 on good days,"" said Gharpure, the general manager at the dealership.
Gharpure's experience is not an isolated one. Across India dealerships are being pushed out of business and the Indian auto sector is going through its biggest slump in nearly two decades. Passenger vehicle sales fell for eight straight months until June, and in May sales dropped 20.55% - the sharpest recorded fall in 18 years.
Preliminary data indicates passenger vehicle sales may have plunged as much as 30 percent in July. The slump in India, along with a simultaneous slide in Chinese auto sales, is a blow for automakers wrestling with higher costs driven by more stringent emission norms and a push to develop electric cars.
Unlike in China, where the plunge in cars sales has been caused largely by new emissions rules, India has seen a mix of factors that have combined to erode demand for automobiles. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2016 ban on high-value bank notes, higher tax rates under a new goods and services tax regime, a boom of ride-sharing firms such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Ola, and a weak rural economy have all played a role. 
But many dealers and automakers agree it is a deepening liquidity crunch among India's shadow banks that has been the biggest single factor in an auto sales collapse, which some fear may lead to more than a million job losses. 
Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), or shadow banks, have dramatically slashed lending following the collapse of one of the biggest, IL&FS, in late 2018.
IL&FS, or Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd, was a behemoth in shadow banking and its defaults and unraveling, amid fraud allegations, have dried up funding for rivals and led to a surge in their borrowing costs.
Non-bank or shadow banking firms generate credit outside traditional lenders, by means such as collective investment vehicles, broker-dealers or funds that invest in bonds and money markets.
In India, NBFCs have in recent years helped fund nearly 55-60% of commercial vehicles both new and used, 30% of passenger cars and nearly 65% of the two-wheelers in the country, according to rating agency ICRA. 
To aggravate matters, the stress in the autos market has also prompted banks to begin trimming their exposure to the sector.
""The car doesn't sell, it's the finance that sells,"" said R. Vijayaraghavan, a senior marketing consultant at the same Mumbai dealership. ""Today the finance is not selling, so the cars are not selling."" 
PROBLEMS AMPLIFIED
Some 286 dealerships have shut down in the last 18 months across India as rising costs for inventory management have made businesses unviable, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), a lobby group of auto dealers.
""The slowdown in the (NBFC) sector has dragged down vehicle sales growth,"" said A.M. Karthik, financial sector head at ICRA. ""Now the auto slowdown is becoming more visible as the liquidity squeeze continues.""
Automakers including Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI), Tata Motors (NS:TAMO), and Mahindra & Mahindra (NS:MAHM) are feeling the heat and have either cut production or temporarily closed plants to correct mounting stocks.
According to FADA data, passenger vehicle inventories now stand at 50-60 days up from around 45 days earlier, while those of two-wheelers are even higher at 80-90 days. For commercial vehicles, inventory levels range between 45 and 50 days.
""We are asking dealers to maintain an inventory of 21 days, which is almost half of the current levels,"" said Ashish Kale, president of FADA.
At least four dealers from different brands said, however, there was little scope to reduce inventories as automakers were pushing them to buy stock despite there being no demand even with heavy discounting and other sops on offer. 
While 70-75% of car sales were previously financed in-house by NBFC or bank agents sitting at a dealership, that has fallen to about 50%, say dealers, as buyers struggle to qualify under more stringent lending norms put in place by lenders that are under pressure to shore up their books. 
Moreover, as many NBFCs typically lent to less creditworthy clients, banks are reticent to rush in to fill the void, as they themselves struggle to cope with an existing pile of about $150 billion in bad loans. 
""The banking sector is certainly one of the factors that has affected the growth of the industry,"" said R.C. Bhargava, chair of Maruti Suzuki, noting interest rates for car buyers have gone up in the last 12 months despite the central bank cutting rates. 
EARLY RECOVERY UNLIKELY
With the autos sector employing more than 35 million people directly and indirectly, and contributing more than 7% to India's GDP and accounting for 49% of its manufacturing GDP, the fallout from the autos slump is huge and presents a big challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as it begins its second term. 
The entire supply chain, from vehicle manufacturers to component makers, are bleeding amid the slump.
""I've been making my payments for the last 30 years and the lenders know me,"" said Adarsh Gupta, the director of finance at Autolite (India), a component manufacturing firm. ""But even a two-day delay has people crying that I will default.
""I too want to pay, but because of the fall in cashflows I'm facing short-term issues and because of that it's difficult to get more financing. This is the vicious cycle we are in.""
Kale, the FADA president, said on Sunday the trade body estimated that dealerships had collectively already cut around 7-8% of their workforce, or around 200,000 jobs nationwide.
""Most of the cuts which have happened are in front-end sales jobs but if this continues, then even the technical jobs will be affected because if we are selling less then we will also service less,"" he said. 
Still, automakers are hopeful of a recovery in the months ahead, helped by the September-December festive season that traditionally sees a surge in consumer spending.
""One can only wish that things improve sooner rather than later. With festive demand starting to seep through, we should start seeing a gradual improvement in sales,"" said P.B. Balaji, group CFO at Tata Motors.
Analysts are more skeptical though, and say without vehicle financing becoming cheaper and easier the chances for that are low. With no silver lining in sight, analysts fear bad debts could mount in the auto sector, forcing banks to further reduce their exposure.
""We see market prices and sales coming down so there may be issues,"" said a top official at the Indian Banks' Association. ""We could see a spillover in terms of bad loans for the overall sector, but we are going to wait and watch."" 
Dealers said they were hopeful of tiding over the current downturn as the broader growth story for India remains intact, but there could be a lot more pain before a recovery kicks in.

""The future is going to be multi-brand car showrooms,"" said marketing consultant Vijayaraghavan. ""That is the only way for dealerships to survive going forward as overhead costs need to be shared.""

898,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2019 10:34AM ET</span>",JPMorgan in pole position to lead WeWork IPO after debt offering: sources,"By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company has tapped JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) to head an upcoming debt offering, putting the bank in pole position to lead a planned initial public offering (IPO) later this year, people familiar with the matter said.
WeWork would like work on the debt offering to begin as early as next week, although this is subject to change as there are regulatory hurdles to be cleared, the sources said.
WeWork has not officially hired banks for the IPO but the expectation among people involved in the process is that any lender's role in the debt offering will have a direct impact on its role in the IPO, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the details are private.
Other banks, including Goldman Sachs (N:GS), are also expected to have prominent roles for the IPO, the sources said.
WeWork is looking to raise $5 billion to $6 billion through the bond offering and is then looking to go public as soon as September, Reuters reported last month.
Leading the WeWork IPO would be a coup for JPMorgan and means it would occupy the lead spot on two of the three largest IPOs of 2019, having led preparations for the  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) listing in March. Rival  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) was the lead bank on the  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) IPO in May.
In proceeds from U.S. IPOs for this year as of Aug. 1, Goldman Sachs is on top, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC), JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley following, according to Refinitiv data.
The We Company, based in New York and founded in 2010, was most recently valued at $47 billion, making it one of the biggest private companies in the world.
WeWork has helped popularize ""coworking"", or shared desk-space, with a focus on startups, entrepreneurs and freelancers, and has received significant backing from some of the world's biggest investors, including Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984).
Despite its vast growth, the company has faced questions about the sustainability of its business model, which is based on short-term revenue agreements and long-term loan liabilities.
In both the scale of its valuation and losses, The We Company has echoes of both Uber and Lyft, whose shares have struggled since going public this year amid questions about their paths to profitability.
The We Company, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, declined to comment."

(Reuters) -  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) on Saturday said its quarterly operating profit fell more than analysts expected, as weakness in insurance underwriting, a slowing economy and trade woes weighed on the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett.
Berkshire's auto insurer Geico suffered a larger number of accident claims, while competition from foreign producers, lower imports and ""trade policy"" dampened cargo volumes for consumer and agricultural products at its BNSF railroad.
Earnings also barely budged at Berkshire's manufacturing businesses, where U.S. tariffs hurt sales of gas turbine and pipe products at its Precision Castparts unit, and its service and retailing businesses.
Second-quarter operating profit declined 11% to $6.14 billion, or roughly $3,757 per Class A share, from $6.89 billion, or roughly $4,190 per Class A share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average expected operating profit of $3,851.28 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Berkshire also said quarterly net income rose 17% to $14.07 billion, or $8,608 per Class A share, from $12.01 billion, or $7,301 per Class A share, a year earlier, reflecting higher unrealized gains on Berkshire's investments.
A U.S. accounting rule requires Berkshire to report such gains with earnings. That rule adds volatility to Berkshire's net results, and Buffett says it can mislead investors.
The U.S. economy's annualized growth rate slowed to 2.1% in the second quarter from 3.1% in the first quarter, as an acceleration in consumer spending was partially offset by declining exports, manufacturing and business investment, reflecting the trade war between the United States and China.
Buffett told CNBC in May that a U.S.-China trade war would be ""bad for the whole world,"" and a full-scale trade war would be ""bad for everything Berkshire owns.""
MORE CASH
Berkshire ended June with $122.4 billion of cash and equivalents, reflecting Buffett's 3-1/2-year drought in finding big acquisitions since buying Precision Castparts. 
He has instead invested elsewhere, building a $50.5 billion stake in iPhone maker Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and committing $10 billion in April to help Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) buy rival Anardako Petroleum Corp (N:APC). Berkshire has also bought back $2.1 billion of its stock this year.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate operates more than 90 businesses that also include Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, and its namesake energy company and real estate brokerage.
It also owns dozens of stocks, including Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO).
Class A shares of Berkshire closed Friday at $306,000, about 9% below their peak last October. Class B shares closed at $202.67, closer to 10% below their peak.
CONSUMER DRAG
Insurance underwriting profit dropped 63% to $353 million, with declines in several businesses.
Geico's pre-tax underwriting gain fell 42%, as a higher ratio of loss claims to premiums earned more than offset growth in policies written.
Underwriting at Berkshire's reinsurance, property/casualty and commercial insurance units also weakened, reflecting higher claims payouts, changes in the expected timing of future payouts, and currency fluctuations, among other factors.
Berkshire was nonetheless able to boost float, or insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund growth, by another $1 billion in the quarter, to $125 billion.
BNSF's profit rose 2% to $1.34 billion, while revenue was essentially unchanged.
Profit was also flat in Berkshire's manufacturing, services and retailing businesses, totaling $2.49 billion.
While Berkshire said more people flew NetJets corporate jets, ""soft consumer demand"" weighed on sales at home furnishings businesses, which include Nebraska Furniture Mart.

Berkshire Hathaway Energy saw profit rise 4%.

Nissan wants Renault to reduce its 43.4% stake in the Japanese auto company, according to emails reviewed by WSJ.
The discussions, which are at an early stage, started soon after the potential deal between Renault and FCA collapsed, the report added. Talks could extend until the end of the year.
The negotiations could lead to an initial memorandum of understanding on restructuring as early as September, the Journal reported, citing emails. 
Nissan and FCA said they had no comment on the WSJ report. Renault was not immediately available for a comment.
FCA said in June that it had abandoned its $35 billion merger offer for Renault, blaming French politics for scuttling the deal. The French government owns a 15% stake in Renault.

Reuters had reported in June that a revival of the collapsed merger plans of FCA and Renault may hinge on the French carmaker cutting its stake in Nissan.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 08:47PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Disney report to shine spotlight on streaming war,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Quarterly reports next week from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, CBS and Viacom will likely highlight increasing competition in video streaming and could spark volatility in the so-called communication services sector, which has outperformed since it was overhauled last year.
The S&P 500 communication services index has increased 20% so far in 2019, beating the S&P 500's 17% gain and all but two of 11 sectors - technology and real estate. That strong performance is in large part thanks to a recovery by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), as investors bet that the world's largest social network will keep growing, even as it faces regulatory hurdles.
June-quarter results from Disney, CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom Inc will keep investors fixated on a rising wave of competition in video streaming against market leader Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). All those companies fall within the communication services sector.
Netflix's stock has sunk 14% since it reported on July 17 that it unexpectedly lost U.S. subscribers in the second quarter, rattling investors already worried about the upcoming launch of Disney's streaming service.
Disney's family-friendly Disney+, set to launch on Nov. 12 with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies, is viewed as the most dangerous threat to Netflix. Disney's shares hit a record high on Monday and have surged 28% this year.
""There is an analysis that has been going on among investors, looking at the number of subscribers Netflix has and the growth that Disney's service could put up in the next three or four years, and the huge disparity in the two companies' valuations,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. 
The recent increase in Disney's shares and decline in Netflix's shows that investors expect Disney to significantly dent Netflix's leadership in streaming, Carlson said. 
Disney's stock is trading at 22 times expected earnings, its highest forward earnings valuation since 2004, according to Refinitiv data. Netflix's forward earnings valuation has dipped to 66 from 82 in early July, before its disappointing quarterly report. 
GRAPHIC: Disney vs Netflix - https://tmsnrt.rs/2yv6T41
Smaller players CBS and sister company Viacom have also built advertising-supported and subscription video services to compete with Netflix, and they are providing original content to other distributors.
Beyond streaming, investors watching Disney's report on Tuesday will focus on its recent run of box office hits, including ""The Lion King,"" which has increased Disney's lead position at the U.S. box office. Disney owns the five-highest grossing movies of 2019, led by “Avengers: Endgame” and “Captain Marvel.” 
""The Netflix disappointment and the big Disney box office numbers underscore the importance of intellectual property, of ownership of content,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. Even though Netflix makes many of its own shows, it still relies on other producers, he said. 
Netflix is losing its two most-watched shows in the United States - “Friends” and “The Office” - to upcoming rival services from AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and NBC Universal in 2020 and 2021, respectively. 
Viacom and CBS, both controlled by the Redstone family’s National Amusements Inc, have worked out a management structure that would see Viacom Chief Executive Officer Robert Bakish leading the combined company if a merger deal is reached, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, removing a major roadblock in talks to recombine the corporations.
In addition to looking for potential confirmation of that deal when CBS and Viacom report their results on Thursday, investors will focus on growth in CBS's All Access and Showtime streaming services.
Viacom could also give details about its strategy to sell programming to video streaming services, including its Paramount Television unit's ""Jack Ryan"" TV series, based on the character created by author Tom Clancy, which premiered last year on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime.
Long viewed as stodgy stocks for dividend-oriented investors, the telecom services sector was renamed communication services last September and supercharged with internet heavyweights Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Facebook, Netflix and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), along with videogame makers. It was the biggest shakeup of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, since it was created in 1999. It has gained 5% since then, while the S&P 500 is unchanged over the same period.
CBS and Viacom have both gained about 15% in 2019.
Helped by its $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox's assets, Disney is expected by analysts to report a 41% jump in fiscal third-quarter revenue to $21.5 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts on average expect earnings per share of $1.75. Disney's EPS has met or exceeded consensus estimates in six of the past eight quarters.

""My guess is the company will want to focus on content and investors will want to hear more about the streaming strategy,"" Ablin said.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 06:04PM ET</span>",U.S. tariff threat may compound Apple's iPhone woes: BofA,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) could see a hit to its annual earnings from U.S. President Donald Trump's newly proposed 10% tariff on Chinese imports from Sept. 1, analysts from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said on Friday.
""Our back of the envelope math suggests the impact (of the new tariffs) will be roughly $0.50-$0.75 (annualized per share) hit to earnings with roughly $0.30-$0.50 from iPhones,"" the brokerage said.
Shares in Apple, which reported a surprise improvement in its fortunes in China earlier this week, sank 2.5% in morning trade, adding to similar losses a day earlier after Trump tore up a trade truce with China that had lasted just over a month.
The United States and China have been locked in a trade war marked by tit-for-tat tariffs since last year. The tensions have disrupted global supply chains and roiled financial markets.
The BofA note also provided for the possibility that Apple might raise prices of iPhones by around 10%, reducing demand by 20% or around 10 million units.
Apple effectively cut iPhone prices in China earlier this year after currency exchange rates had made the phones too expensive for many Chinese consumers.
Globally, iPhone sales fell 12% to $25.99 billion in the latest reported quarter, after dropping 17% in the second quarter."
903,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 05:59PM ET</span>",Stocks - Trade Jitters Send Wall Street to Worst Week of Year,"Investing.com - Stocks fell for a fifth-straight day Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite suffering their worst weekly losses since the depths of the December slump.
If there was good news for stocks it was that buying kicked in after President Donald Trump reportedly softened his threat slightly to impose 10% tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States in September, according to CNBC. If there's proof China is, in fact, buying agricultural and other products, the United States might not impose the tariffs.
The S&P 500 was down 0.73% on the day. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.32%, and the Dow Jones industrials fell 0.37%. The Dow had been down as many as 311 points early in the day.
The Nasdaq 100, a more concentrated list, was off 1.4%, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) contributing half the point loss on the day.
The S&P and Nasdaq declines were their fifth in a row. The Dow's decline was its fourth straight.
The S&P 500 finished down 3.1% for the week. The Nasdaq dropped 3.9%. The Dow's decline was 2.6%. 
The declines exploded Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested in a news conference that the Fed's quarter-point rate cut might be a one-time event. He tried to take it back, but the rout was on.
The selling erupted again Thursday after Trump tweeted his threat to impose more retaliatory tariffs on China and continued into Friday until CNBC reported he softened his view if there's real agricultural buying. White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow, however, downplayed the report.
The trade battles and the Administration's unhappiness with the Fed's modest rate cut to 2% to 2.25% left many traders exhausted at the end of the week. Next week is light on economic reports. So, the potential for market drama is strong.
The focus on trade totally overwhelmed any market reaction to the Labor Department's report the economy added 164,000 jobs in July. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7%. Payroll gains have slowed. But most economists said the report was solid. 
But from an equity perspective, solid economic numbers can bring out the sellers as it hurts the chances for future interest rate cuts.
The Dow opened lower and slid steeply until buying started to kick in at about 11 AM ET (15:00 GMT). 
The rebound wasn't enough to bring stocks overall back to even. Techs and communications services stocks were weak all day. NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) slumped more than 20% after warning that the cloud-data company's fiscal-first quarter revenue could be down as much as 20% from a year ago. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dropped because it depends so much on access to the Chinese market for new business and because most of its products are manufactured in China. They would potentially be hurt by a new round of tariffs. The shares were down 2% on the day and subtracted 29 points from the Dow.
 
 
 
Oil prices recovered from a big selloff Thursday. WTI futures rose $1.71 to $55.66. Brent crude rebounded $1.39 to $61.89. Both had fallen more than 7% a day earlier.
Interest rates were lower, with the 10-Year Treasury yield falling to 1.855% from 1.892% on Thursday.

904,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 05:58PM ET</span>",Trump says auto tariffs never off the table in EU trade talks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday blasted the European Union for its use of trade barriers and revived his threat to impose U.S. tariffs on European automobiles if he does not see progress in stalled negotiations between the longstanding partners.
Trump made the comments shortly after signing a deal to sell more U.S. beef to Europe, an event at which he startled participants by joking that his administration was working ""on a 25% tariff on all Mercedes-Benz and BMWs coming into our nation"". He then said he only kidding.
""The EU has tremendous barriers to us,"" Trump told reporters later at the White House. ""They're very, very difficult.""
Trump said the threat of auto tariffs may have helped move the EU toward accepting the beef deal, but auto tariffs remain an option.
""Auto tariffs are never off the table,"" Trump said. ""If I don't get what we want, I'll put auto tariffs. ... If I don't get what I want, I'll have no choice but maybe to do that. But so far they've been very good.""
EU officials have said they are eager to work with the United States to reform the World Trade Organization (WTO) and rein in China's behavior on world markets, but would retaliate if Washington makes good on its threat to raise car tariffs.
Sabine Weyand, the European Commission's director general of trade, last month said Brussels would not be bullied by the threat of car tariffs, which it views as illegal under WTO rules.
Negotiators for Brussels and Washington have been meeting since Trump and then-European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to ease trade tensions last year, but have made little progress and remain at odds over the scope of the talks.
The United States wants agricultural products included in a broader trade deal, but the EU has said its mandate from member countries does not include that area.
Germany's coordinator for transatlantic ties, Peter Beyer, said the beef agreement shows progress is possible when both sides work together constructively, and called for fresh efforts to reach a broader trade deal.

""I urge the United States to now, finally, begin serious negotiations to reach an industrial tariff agreement"" he said in a statement.

905,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 05:36PM ET</span>","With Puerto Rico leader set to quit, successor still unknown","SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Embattled Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló on Friday said the lawyer who formerly represented the bankrupt island in the U.S. Congress will take over when he resigns following street protests over corruption investigations and profane text messages.
Pedro Pierluisi, who has advised the unpopular federal panel overseeing the U.S. territory's finances, will be sworn in as governor after Rosselló's exit, Rosselló said in a statement.
A crowd of hundreds of people, many waving the U.S. territory's flag, chanted and rang bells outside the governor's mansion in the historic center of San Juan as they awaited Rosselló. The same street was the site of 12 nights of protests demanding his exit.
The choice of Pierluisi remains controversial as Puerto Rico's Senate has not yet confirmed him as secretary of state, next in line to succeed a resigning governor.
Anger has been building for years in Puerto Rico over a series of crises including the island's bankruptcy filing, ineffective recovery efforts after a 2017 hurricane killed more than 3,000 people and corruption scandals linked to governors.
The House voted 26 in favor of his nomination and 21 against, with one abstention. The Senate has yet to vote.
Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz sent a statement saying the House vote ""deserves total respect from everyone. Now it passes to the Senate. With the greatest sense of responsibility, we will respond. Next Wednesday, the full Senate will attend. That day the matter will be resolved.""
Protesters and ruling party leaders including Schatz have rejected Pierluisi as the island’s next governor, saying his work as an attorney for the fiscal control board overseeing the island’s bankruptcy created conflicts of interest.
José Julián Alvarez, constitutional law professor at the University of Puerto Rico Law School, has contended that Pierluisi's nomination as secretary of state must be confirmed by both Puerto Rico's House and Senate before he could become governor.

Federal officials and investors are keenly watching the island's uncertain political transition. Puerto Rico has $42.5 billion in federal disaster funding allocated to it, and its bankruptcy is the biggest ever in the U.S. municipal bond market.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street extended its sell-off on Friday on renewed trade fears as the benchmark S&P 500 index and Nasdaq saw their worst weekly percentage plunges since December, when investors were spooked by the prospect of a looming recession.
The blue chip Dow and the S&P 500 hit their lowest levels since late June with S&P 500 and the Nasdaq registering their fifth consecutive days of losses.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields saw their steepest weekly decline in over seven years.
The sell-off wrapped up a tumultuous week, which saw the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 and a renewal of trade war fears following a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump announcing plans to impose additional tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports on Sept 1.
""The irony is that these trade policies are creating an environment for the Fed to lend itself to further rate cuts,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner at the Keator Group in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""But Trump is tweeting about hawkish trade policies and the market is going down because of it.""
A report from Labor Department on Friday showed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs last month, in line with economists' expectations.

Second-quarter earnings season passed its halfway mark, with 380 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 73.9% have beaten analyst expectations.
New tariff threats dragged oil prices lower for the week, as  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) reported quarterly results.
Exxon topped analyst expectations but fell year-on-year, while Chevron's earnings rose 26%, in line with forecasts.
Sprint Corp shares dropped 5.8% even after reporting fewer-than-expected phone subscriber losses in the quarter.
Restaurant Brands International jumped 6.1%, after quarterly profits topped expectations.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Apple said on Friday it had paused the program called ""grading"", where it reviewed anonymized recordings of conversations people had with its Siri voice assistant.
The decision comes after the Guardian last week reported that the company's contractors tasked with reviewing the recordings regularly heard confidential information and private conversations. 
Increased public and political scrutiny of data privacy practices have forced greater transparency from Silicon Valley companies, with Google pausing reviews of audio recordings from its Google assistant service for all purposes in all languages, after a leak of Dutch audio data.
Proposals being weighed by lawmakers in the United States and elsewhere would limit how internet companies track and distribute consumer information as voice assistants such as Siri and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Alexa become a bigger part of people's everyday lives. 
""While we conduct a thorough review, we are suspending Siri grading globally,"" an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement, adding that users will be able to opt out of the program in a future software update.
Contractors graded Siri's answers to user queries as part of efforts to perform quality checks, the Guardian reported. They also looked at whether the response was triggered accidentally, the newspaper said.
Users can turn off storing audio data to their Google account completely, or choose to auto-delete data after every three months or 18 months, a Google spokeswoman told Reuters.
Amazon also said it allows users to opt-out of having their voice recordings used to help develop new Alexa features.
The company will be update the information provided to customers to make the practices more clear, an Amazon spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

912,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 04:05PM ET</span>",Johnson's Brexit Enemies Prepare for Fight After Tasting Victory,"(Bloomberg) -- In the rolling hills of the Welsh countryside, 73-year-old retired civil engineer Alan Marr fears the U.K. is heading for the “lunacy” of a no-deal divorce from the European Union.
His vote for the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats in the Brecon and Radnorshire special election Thursday helped the party score a significant victory over Boris Johnson’s Conservatives, reducing the prime minister’s parliamentary majority to one and making his task of delivering Brexit even harder.
“How can we not have a trade deal with such a big bloc?” said Marr, whose wife is Dutch and who brings home honey, olive oil and wine from vacations in Portugal and Spain. He also used to work on EU-supported infrastructure projects in Wales. “I feel very close to Europe, and don’t want to break away.”
Deep in sheep-farming country, the Liberal Democrats overturned an 8,000-vote Tory majority with the help of an electoral pact between pro-EU parties, who stood aside to improve the chances of a “Remain” victory. A repeat of such cooperation in Parliament or in a potential general election -- though it’s much harder in a national poll -- could make it more difficult for Johnson to keep his “do or die” pledge to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31.
“In the first week of Boris Johnson’s premiership, we’ve burst his bubble,” Jane Dodds, the winning Liberal Democrat politician, said against the dramatic backdrop of the Brecon Beacons range of hills, where the military conducts training. “I hope he listens and takes a no-deal Brexit off the table.”
Electoral Boost
Though that’s not likely to happen, the Brecon victory is another boost for the Liberal Democrats, who are currently polling at about 20% nationally after years in the doldrums following their coalition with the Tories until 2015. The constituency mirrored the 2016 Brexit referendum result, voting 52% to 48% to leave the EU.
But a no-deal divorce from the bloc is worrying farmers, whose sales of Welsh lamb to the continent could face steep export tariffs.
Gill Bradshaw, a 62-year-old Remain supporter who voted Lib Dem for the first time, welcomed their alliance with the Green Party and Welsh nationalist Plaid Cymru party. The Liberal Democrats have indicated they’ll consider similar pro-EU alliances on a seat-by-seat basis at any future election.
“It was a good tactical move,” Bradshaw, who normally votes Labour, said as she sold china and glassware in the market hall. “Brexit is a backward step.”
Brexit Vote Split
By contrast, the Tories suffered from the emergence of Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, whose candidate received 3,331 votes. Johnson’s Conservatives would have won had they taken those votes.
To be sure, local factors mean that what happened in Brecon doesn’t necessarily apply nationally. Turnout was lower than usual, while the vote only happened because incumbent Chris Davies was convicted of faking expense claims. Some residents said they voted against him entirely because of that.
Others cast their ballots for reasons beyond Brexit. James Adair, 51, a former post office worker who helps run a military memorabilia shop and wants to leave the EU, said he actually voted tactically for the Liberal Democrats to keep the Conservatives out.
“Johnson, I think, is dangerous,” said Adair, whose wife relies heavily on the state-run National Health Service and is worried it will be privatized by the government. “The more important thing for me at the moment is to put Brexit aside and get rid of the Tories.”
For Johnson, the immediate concern is how the Brecon result has cut his already wafer-thin Parliament majority, making him more vulnerable in a no-confidence vote. The main opposition Labour Party has hinted it could propose one as early as September.
There are plenty of potential Tory rebels. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, former Secretary of State for Justice David Gauke and former Business Secretary Greg Clark may be willing to tip the vote against their own party to prevent what they see as a calamitous no-deal Brexit.
If Johnson were to lose a confidence vote, he would have a short window to try to form an alternative grouping in Parliament that has a majority. Failing would trigger a general election.
Still, the prospect of a grand anti-Brexit alliance at a general election among opposition parties remains limited, not least because the Liberal Democrats are unwilling to do a deal with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour.
‘Not Idiots’
“We’d be idiots to trust him, and we’re not idiots,” prominent Liberal Democrat Ed Davey said at the vote count, pointing to Corbyn’s ambiguous position on Brexit. “He’s under immense pressure to back Remain, and he hasn’t.”
That doesn’t mean the challenge facing Johnson isn’t significant, especially if he tries to get his own Brexit deal with Brussels -- which currently looks unlikely given the impasse on both sides -- through Parliament. The math is against him, which is why speculation the prime minister might seek a direct mandate from the public in an early general election, or even that he might suspend the legislature to get Brexit done, refuses to go away.
Yet the result in Wales suggests Johnson will face a stiff fight whichever route he chooses.
“We’re going to be open-heartedly working with others to achieve our ultimate goals,” the Liberal Democrats’ new leader, Jo Swinson, said in Brecon."
913,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 03:55PM ET</span>",Trump Tightens Aid for Puerto Rico as Turmoil Grips Island,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is planning to place restrictions on disaster aid for U.S. states and territories, holding up $8 billion that Puerto Rico is relying on to rebuild from Hurricane Maria and reverse an economic rout that drove the government into bankruptcy.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development plans to release rules for accessing the $16 billion in disaster mitigation grants announced last year, two senior department officials said Friday. The rules will allow states to get money before Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, both battered by the 2017 storm.
The decision escalates the long-running clash between President Donald Trump and officials in Puerto Rico who’ve complained about the federal response and the pace at which aid has been released. The administration’s hand has been strengthened by the turmoil that’s engulfing Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, who resigned in the face of massive protests over callous and profane texts with his aides and a federal corruption investigation that led to the indictment of two of his former top officials. Rossello is due to step down Friday, but it’s not yet clear who will replace him.
The department will release rules for U.S. states in coming weeks, the officials said, and rules for territories will come later. The delay for Puerto Rico is due to concern over the territory’s financial controls and the current political instability, one official said.
“Recovery efforts in jurisdictions prepared to do their part should not be held back due to alleged corruption, fiscal irregularities and financial mismanagement occurring in Puerto Rico and capacity issues in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which is why HUD will award disaster mitigation funds in two separate tranches,” said HUD Secretary Ben Carson in a news release.
The release of aid is critical to Puerto Rico’s effort to emerge from bankruptcy, with the island’s federal overseers counting on rebuilding to provide a jolt to the economy.
Yet Trump has repeatedly lashed out over help extended to the island, falsely claiming that Puerto Rico has received more than $90 billion and incorrectly asserting that officials wanted to use it to pay off bondholders. While about $42.5 billion has been allocated to the island, only about $13.6 billion has so far been disbursed, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency."
914,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 03:20PM ET</span>",Group of 12 U.S. states challenge Trump fuel economy penalty freeze,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 12 states led by California and New York on Friday challenged the Trump administration's decision to suspend a 2016 Obama administration regulation that more than doubled penalties for automakers that fail to meet fuel efficiency requirements.
Automakers protested the higher penalties, which they said could cost the industry up to $1 billion annually, and the Trump administration finalized the regulatory freeze on July 12. The 12 states, joined by the District of Columbia, filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reverse the rule released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
Congress in 2015 ordered federal agencies to adjust a wide range of civil penalties to account for inflation and, in response, the NHTSA, under Democratic President Barack Obama, issued rules to eventually raise fines to $14 from $5.50 for every 0.1 mile per gallon of fuel that new cars and trucks consume in excess of the required standards.
The NHTSA, in response to a question on the lawsuit, on Friday reiterated its statement from last month that it was following the intent of Congress to ensure the penalty rate was set at the level required by law.
In a statement, the California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said the Trump administration wants to ""make these penalties meaningless,"" while New York's attorney general, Letitia James, called the rule ""another misguided and reckless attempt by the Trump Administration to roll back the clock on our clean air standards.""
The move comes as the NHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency are working to finalize a rewrite of the Obama administration’s fuel efficiency requirements through 2026. 
The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel-efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026, compared with 37 mpg under the Trump administration’s preferred option.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) , Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and others, had said the higher penalties could increase industry compliance costs by $1 billion annually and result in ""significant economic harm.""
Some automakers historically have paid fines instead of meeting fuel efficiency requirements. In February,  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) told Reuters it had paid $77 million in U.S. civil penalties in 2018 for failing to meet 2016 economy requirements.

Environmental groups urged the administration to retain the increase, noting U.S. fuel economy fines have lost nearly 75% of their original value.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao is set to grant tentative approval on Friday for an expanded transatlantic joint venture including Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), Air France KLM SA (PA:AIRF) and Virgin Atlantic, a source briefed on the matter said.
The expanded joint venture would replace two previously approved arrangements in the U.S.-United Kingdom and U.S.-Continental Europe markets and will allow for additional benefits like more options on European flights, the person said.
The U.S. Department of Transportation is set to issue an order tentatively granting the joint venture antitrust immunity and will require the carriers to report annually on commercial cooperation efforts and provide a detailed assessment after five years, added the source, who could not speak for attribution because the decision was not yet public.
In May 2018, the three airlines signed definitive agreements as part of a plan for an expanded transatlantic joint venture.
They said the expanded venture would offer ""the most comprehensive route network, convenient flight schedules, competitive fares and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits"" for flyers.
EU antitrust regulators in February cleared Air France-KLM, Delta and Virgin Group to acquire joint control over Virgin Atlantic, saying they did not see any competition concerns.
The deal involves Air France-KLM buying 31% of Virgin Atlantic from Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, giving it joint control of the airline together with Delta and Virgin Group.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>",JPMorgan set for historic majority stake in China funds JV: sources,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was on Friday poised to become the first foreign company to hold a majority stake in a Chinese mutual fund business, two sources said, setting a precedent that one analyst said would trigger a wave of similar transactions. 
A 2% percent stake in the venture, China International Fund Management (CIFM), changed hands in an auction at the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange. 
In a filing on Friday, the exchange did not identify the buyer, but two sources with knowledge of the deal, which still needs regulatory approval, told Reuters that JPMorgan Asset Management Co was the sole bidder. JPMorgan, which had held 49% of the venture, declined to comment. 
Under rule changes announced by China in late 2017, foreign asset managers were authorized to own up to 51 percent of their Chinese mutual fund ventures.
But so far none had raised their stakes to absolute majorities.
Last month Beijing, embroiled in a bitter trade war with Washington that is weighing on its economy, said it would scrap financial sector ownership limits in 2020, one year earlier than scheduled. 
Also on Friday,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) became the latest of a handful of foreign firms to take a majority stake in a China-based brokerage venture, also buying a 2% stake.
Peter Alexander, Managing Director of Shanghai-based fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors, said both transactions were likely to be the tip of an iceberg.
""China policy, irrespective of ongoing bilateral trade issues, is centered on the opening up of the local financial services industry to global participation,"" Alexander said, referring to the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war. 
""What's frustrating to us is seeing just how ill prepared the vast majority of global players are to move on the opportunity. Expect a scramble once people return from their summer holidays."" 
The CIFM auction closed at a price of 241.3 million yuan ($34.78 million), the Shanghai Exchange said. 
Alexander said that meant JPMorgan was paying a 33% premium to raise its stake to 51%, which he called ""rather rich"", but ""not over-priced"".
He expected the deal's metrics would be applied to future similar transactions in China's fast-growing, $2 trillion mutual fund industry. 

Before the JPMAM bid, Shanghai International Trust - belonging to Shanghai Pudong Development Group - owned 51% of CIFM.

924,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 12:49PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Deutsche Bank faces $1.1 billion bill to exit derivatives,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has set aside over 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to cover the cost of offloading derivatives in its 'bad bank,' or capital release unit, three sources at the bank told Reuters.
The cost, which has not been publicly disclosed, is included within the 7.4-billion euro budget the German lender has set aside for its restructuring, which will also see 18,000 jobs axed as the bank exits unprofitable businesses.
Key to the restructuring is the creation of a 'bad bank' to house 288 billion euros of unwanted assets earmarked for sale or wind-down, including equity derivatives and long-dated interest rate and credit derivatives. 
Deutsche Bank is still assessing and gauging interest in the assets before repackaging some for sale, the sources said. 
Deutsche Bank declined to comment. 
The bank will run a formal auction of its equity derivatives book, which Reuters reported last week had garnered ""significant expressions of interest"" from U.S. and European banks, over the next two months, the sources said. 
After that, it will attempt to sell portfolios of long-dated interest rate and credit derivatives. Those assets have low returns and require high levels of capital to be held against them, making them less attractive to buyers. As a result, Deutsche Bank may have to offer deep discounts to offload them, the sources said.
Deutsche Bank executives believe they have made a conservative assumption of the cost of offloading the derivatives and are confident that writedowns will not exceed their expectations. 
However, if the cost of exiting the positions were to be higher than anticipated, the bank would likely have to hold some of the derivatives positions beyond the 2022 deadline it has set for offloading them, the sources said.
The alternative would be to take deep writedowns and raise funds from shareholders to cover the extra losses, something it has ruled out doing. It is not certain investors would even back such a move, having already stumped up 29.3 billion euros in four capital raises since 2010.
The bank has targeted reducing assets held in the unit to 119 billion euros this year and 9 billion euros by 2022.
Consultants questioned whether the bank can achieve that target while keeping within its budget. 
""If they have some really smart structures in mind and are prepared to take deep discounts that may be achievable, but if they want to do it in an orderly fashion and limit the downside I'd say they're looking at 5 years,"" said Robert Cranmer, a partner at financial services consultancy Sionic.
Mayra Rodriguez Valladares, managing principal at consultancy MRV Associates, said the bank will face significant administrative costs on top of writedowns from asset sales.
""I think this is going to cost a lot more. I don't see how they're going to get away with this little expense to wind all this down,"" she said. ""Deutsche will have to hire external auditors to make sure everything is in order and there will be additional IT expenses."" 
Deutsche Bank's Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing is looking to restore confidence among investors who have seen the bank's stock lose more than three-quarters of its value over the past four years.
The derivatives positions, some of which don't expire for as long as thirty years, are tying up capital that could generate hundreds of millions of euros in income each year, Reuters reported last week.
Deutsche Bank announced the creation of its capital release unit in July. It is the bank's second attempt at hiving off unwanted assets since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
The unit houses fixed-income assets, including long-dated interest rate derivatives, worth 79 billion euros, Deutsche Bank has said. It also contains 25 billion euros of assets, mostly credit and interest rate derivatives, which Deutsche Bank initially hived off for sale or write-down in 2017.
Some analysts say Deutsche Bank will still be left holding problem assets even if it successfully offloads those placed in the capital restructuring unit. 
Only 30 percent of Deutsche Bank's 24 billion euros of Level 3 assets, which are the most illiquid and hard to value, have been placed within the unit, according to a presentation the bank made alongside its second-quarter results last month.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment on why it chose not to place more Level 3 assets in its 'bad bank.'

925,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 12:41PM ET</span>","U.S. cows and pigs gorge on bakery rolls, pet food as corn prices surge","By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farmers are feeding their livestock everything from outdated pet food and leftover bakery rolls to crops imported from South America after unprecedented spring planting delays boosted prices for locally grown corn.
Corn is typically used to fatten hogs, cattle and poultry, but its high price has farmers in the $150 billion U.S. meat and dairy industry looking elsewhere to keep down costs.
Agricultural cooperatives, equipment dealers and plants that process corn into ethanol have already been strained because farmers were unable to plant millions of acres this spring due to widespread flooding.
Meat producers are now turning to substitutes in an attempt to keep production costs down and stretch out supplies of corn held in storage. Many expect corn prices will climb even higher once harvesting starts this fall because yields are expected to be weak due to springtime flooding.
Feed is typically the biggest cost of raising farm animals, so adjusting diets has become critical for producers who are also grappling with a U.S.-China trade war that has hurt exports of American agricultural products including pork.
Higher corn prices could raise costs for meat producers like  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN), which reports earnings on Monday.
CAKES AND CANDIES, ANYONE?
Ohio farmer Jim Heimerl, who sells 700,000 pigs a year, swapped out corn for dry pet food, which he acquires through a broker and can be outdated or mislabeled. Heimerl is also feeding his hogs more wheat middlings, which are a byproduct of the flour milling process.
""We're already starting to ration our corn out,"" he said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicted in July that farmers will harvest the smallest corn crop in four years. Many grain traders and analysts expect the agency will lower its harvest estimate after surveying farmers again about plantings.
Most-active corn futures (Cv1) hit a five-year high in July and are now trading around $4 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, up 7% from a year ago. Farmers have seen prices climb even more in cash markets in areas where rains washed out plantings.
""It's only going to get worse and it's all because of the weather,"" Heimerl said.
In Minnesota, farmer Randy Spronk is using recycled bakery byproducts such as breads, cakes and candies for 10% of his hogs' rations to reduce his need for corn.
""The bushels that are here are precious,"" he said. ""We're trying to make them last as long as we can.""
Spronk buys the crushed bakery goods from ReConserve, which says it is the country's largest recycler of bakery, cereal grain and snack food byproducts.
The bakery goods are safe and nutritious for livestock but do not meet manufacturers' packaging or quality standards for human consumers, said Bryan Bergquist, ReConserve's vice president of feed sales.
""In times like this, when your main input in feeding livestock goes up, you start looking for best cost alternatives,"" said Omarh Mendoza, nutrition director for The Maschhoffs, the largest U.S. family-owned pork producer.
CORN FROM BRAZIL
North Carolina-based Prestage Farms has been feeding distillers' dried grains, an ethanol byproduct, to hogs in Iowa and has also imported corn from Brazil, said John Prestage, whose family owns the company. North Carolina farms use corn from Midwest states including Ohio and Indiana, where cash corn prices will be strong, he said in an email.
""We are looking everywhere to minimize the impact of high priced corn,"" Prestage said. 
Smithfield Foods [SFII.UL], a Prestage Farms partner, books the corn imports and is looking to bring in more, Prestage said. Smithfield, owned by China's WH Group Ltd (HK:0288), declined to comment.
The USDA last month also increased its estimate for the amount of wheat that will be used for feed and residual purposes in 2019/20 by 7% from June to 150 million bushels. That is much smaller than corn feed and residual use of 5.175 billion bushels, but up 65% from the previous year.
Poky Feeders, which raises about 125,000 cattle on three feedlots in Kansas, changed its grain rations to be half wheat from all corn in July, said Chief Executive Joe Morgan. Cattle gain weight well when they eat wheat, he said.
""Most of the time it's just too high compared to corn,"" Morgan said about prices. ""Right now, it's not."""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's biggest automaker,  Maruti Suzuki India  Ltd (NS:MRTI), has cut the number of workers it employs on temporary contracts following a plunge in vehicle sales, it told Reuters.
The auto industry, which accounts for nearly half of India's manufacturing output, is going through one of its worst slowdowns in nearly a decade, with vehicle sales falling rapidly and little sign of a revival anytime soon.
The company said it employed 18,845 temporary workers on average during the six months ended June 30, down 6%, or 1,181 people, from the same period last year, adding that job cuts had accelerated since April.
It is the first time the reduction has been reported. The listed company doesn't have to disclose reductions in temporary workers.
Maruti Suzuki, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269), said it had not reduced its permanent workforce -- which numbered 15,892 at the end of March -- over the past year but declined to say whether further reductions were planned.
It said previously that it had cut production by 10.3% in the first six months of the year.
Maruti Suzuki, which produces about one in two of the passenger vehicles sold in Asia's third-largest economy, on Thursday reported a 33.5% decline in sales in July to 109,265 vehicles compared with July 2018."

LONDON (Reuters) - Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely [GEELY.UL], has produced the first cars containing recycled cobalt mapped using a blockchain, and has joined a separate project to monitor cobalt from Democratic Republic of Congo, Volvo said.
Carmakers are under pressure from customers and investors to prove electric vehicles do not rely on conflict minerals or child labor.
They are exploring the usefulness of blockchain - the technology to create an immutable ledger first used for cryptocurrency - to improve accountability throughout supply chains.
In emailed comments on Friday, Volvo said it had completed the first blockchain, using recycled cobalt in China.
""It tracked cobalt from a Chinese recycling plant to Volvo Cars Zhejiang over a two-month period to June 27,"" Volvo said, adding its aim was ""full transparency and traceability"". 
The blockchain has been developed by British blockchain specialist Circulor using technology from U.S. company Oracle (N:ORCL) and is expected to be rolled out widely this year. Volvo declined to comment on the next steps.
The batteries are made by Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) (SZ:300750).
Volvo also confirmed it was joining fellow automaker Ford (N:F), technology giant  IBM  (N:IBM), South Korean cathode maker LG Chem (KS:051910) and China's Huayou Cobalt (SS:603799) in a project overseen by responsible-sourcing group RCS Global.
In an email, RCS Global said it was pleased Volvo was joining its efforts to achieve ""quantifiable and continuous"" improvement of supply chains.
Among battery minerals, cobalt is particularly challenging because around two thirds of all supplies are from Democratic Republic of Congo, where governance challenges are extreme.
 Glencore  (L:GLEN), a producer of industrial-scale cobalt in Congo, has this year faced a series of problems, including an incursion of artisanal miners on its concession. 
Those involved in tracking minerals say blockchain alone is not the answer.
But they are testing how entering data from each stage of a mineral's journey into a blockchain can improve accountability and even fend off disputes between, say, transportation companies and those using them.
""No technology can completely replace due diligence. What it will do is improve enforcement of standards by highlighting when things are not working as intended,"" Doug Johnson-Poensgen, CEO of Circulor, told Reuters.
Oracle has provided technology for blockchain projects aimed at anything from certifying the origin of olive oil to reducing costs by streamlining cross-border banking payments.

Apart from its work on cobalt, IBM has cooperated with retailers including Walmart (N:WMT) to trace food through supply chains.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A new levy on Turkey's tourism industry will hit hotels and travel agencies from October, squeezing businesses which have been forced to offer hefty discounts to overcome a slump in visitor numbers three years ago.
Half-year figures released this week show a healthy 13% increase in foreign arrivals to Turkey, while a 10% jump in revenue for the sector to $12.6 billion has given a valuable boost to an economy still stuck in recession.
But the levy announced in mid-July, which requires hotels and travel companies to pay up to 0.75% of their total revenues to Turkey's newly founded Tourism Promotion and Development Agency will significantly erode profit margins, businesses say.
Turkey's tourism sector was battered https://tmsnrt.rs/3336LXv in 2016 after a series of bombings, a failed military coup and a crisis with Moscow after Ankara shot down a Russian jet on the Syrian border.
Many firms were forced to slash prices to lure visitors and figures show average spend per tourist is still down by a third from its peak of $974 in 2013.
Muberra Eresin, head of the Hotel Association of Turkey, said the fact that the levy would be calculated from total revenues meant even loss-making businesses would be forced to pay.
""We have experienced a very difficult period in tourism and the sector is just getting on its feet again,"" Eresin told Reuters. ""The agency contribution poses a sustainability risk for businesses as it will not take into account a company's profit or loss.""
Businesses affected by the levy, which will be paid monthly from October, include accommodation facilities, food and drink outlets licensed by the ministry, travel agencies and private airport and terminal operators.
Their contributions are expected to raise around 150 million euros ($166 million) annually for the agency, according to sector representatives.
Travel agency Tigris Tourism Chairman Davut Gunaydin said the levy should have been taken from profits, or imposed at a much lower rate. ""The ratio is very high to be taken from sales revenue, it should be around one third of that,"" Gunaydin said.
Other tourism business owners have suggested the contribution should be taken from visitors, not companies, a method used in other destinations like Dubai and Spain.
""All companies have a budget. The budgets will not add up at (the) last quarter with this contribution,"" a senior manager at an international hotel chain said.
""There are hotels which are writing off losses, having difficulty in paying loans and hotels which restructured their debt,"" the manager said. ""Now all the calculations are trashed."""

MILAN (Reuters) - Shares in  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) went into reverse on Friday as the Italian luxury carmaker failed to lift its guidance for 2019 despite strong results in the first part of the year.
Releasing its second quarter results, the company confirmed that it was on track for the higher end of the guidance range for all relevant figures.
However, there was some disappointment as many investors and analysts thought an upgrade was in store after a forecast-beating first quarter.
""The market was expecting them to raise their guidance for the year,"" a Milan-based trader said.
Trading in the company's Milan-listed shares was halted for excessive declines after a 6.9% drop. They were down 3.55% by 1415 GMT.
For 2019, Ferrari forecasts its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to rise around 10% to between 1.2-1.25 billion euros. Sales are seen growing more than 3% to more than 3.5 billion euros.
Chief Executive Louis Camilleri said there were several factors behind the decision not to lift earnings guidance.
He cited the discontinuation of certain models later this year, less favorable currency effects going forward, global trade tensions, and outperformance in China in the first half of the year as customers snapped up cars in anticipation of stricter anti-pollution rules.
""It would seem to me that it was a prudent move on our path,"" he told analysts on a post-earnings call.
To support its growth, Ferrari will unveil two new models in September, Camilleri said, with one more expected by the end of the year. These are in addition to the two new models the Maranello-based company has already presented this year, including the F90 Stradale, its first hybrid - excluding special editions.
The company's performance is a bright spot in the luxury car segment, where its competitors are struggling.
Last month  Aston Martin  (L:AML) cut its forecasts for volumes, investments and margins for 2019, while Tata Motors' (NS:TAMO) luxury brand Jaguar Land Rover posted a loss in the April-June period with analysts doubting it can be turned around in the short term.
Former Ferrari parent FCA's luxury brand Maserati (MI:FCHA) also lost money, with a negative EBIT margin of 34.7%. The group's CEO Mike Manley said he expected more difficult quarters this year.
""(Ferrari) stock may take a breather today but the story remains exciting and while some were expecting more today on the guidance, we expect buying support on the dip,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a report.
Ferrari said performance in the April-June period was led by robust deliveries of its 8 cylinder Portofino model and higher-margin 12 cylinder 812 Superfast model. Although shipments were up for 8 cylinder models, it cautioned they had slightly decreased for 12 cylinder models.
Ferrari's core earnings rose 8.7% in the second quarter to 314 million euros ($348 million) in line with analyst expectations, according to a Reuters survey.
Margins on adjusted EBITDA weakened to 32% from 33.1% in the first quarter, versus a full-year target of 34%.
Chief Financial Officer Antonio Picca Piccon told analysts margins would suffer a little more in the third quarter compared to the high levels achieved in the same period last year.
Camilleri, who took over from Sergio Marchionne after his death in 2018, said earlier this year that Ferrari is counting on hybrid models and the Purosangue SUV, expected in 2022, to exploit its potential in China.
Ferrari shipped 2,671 cars in the second quarter, including 289 to China, up 63% versus the same period of last year, while shipments to the Americas fell 6% to 803 units."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Levi Strauss & Co  (N:LEVI) has been ""deliberate and diligent"" in moving production out of China because of uncertainty hanging over tariffs on goods imported from China, Chief Executive Officer Chip Bergh said in an interview with Reuters.
Just 1% or 2% of Levi's product sold in the United States are manufactured in China, Bergh said, compared to 16% two years ago. Bergh was speaking one day before President Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on another $300 billion of Chinese goods, including apparel.
Trump has used tariffs as a tool to negotiate better trade terms, saying bad deals cost millions of U.S. jobs. Along with apparel, the new tariffs hit consumer goods such as electronics and toys and come in addition to those already imposed on $250 billion of other goods imported from China.
The on-again, off-again nature of the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods had created uncertainty for many U.S. retailers, Bergh said.
""Every day is a new day,"" he said. ""Sometimes it looks like it's definitely going to happen and then other days you think it's off, it's not going to happen.""
San Francisco-based Levi's, which returned to the public markets in March, is part of a wave of retailers that have been shifting supply chains out of China to countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh. The trend was initially in response to higher Chinese wages but the exodus is expected to be accelerated by the new tariffs, which Trump said will go into effect Sept. 1.
They are expected to increase consumers' costs and have an impact across the entire retail industry.
Apparel retailers like Gap Inc (N:GPS), handbag brand Steve Madden Ltd (O:SHOO) and department store Macy's Inc (N:M) also have acted to move production out of China.
However, China still is a big supplier to the industry with 42% of apparel and 69% of footwear sold in the United States made in China, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.
Following the latest tariff news, several large retail trade groups warned the levied tariffs will hurt consumer purchases, raise prices and limit hiring.
Levi's has two of its own factories in Poland and South Africa but mostly uses third-party vendors or suppliers spread across 22 different countries, said Bergh, who joined the company in September 2011.
""We've narrowed down our supplier base during the time that I've been here to really develop deeper, more strategic relationships with many of our suppliers,"" he said.
Many of Levi's suppliers in China are publicly traded companies that have multi-country footprints, said Bergh, that have diversified risk by building factories in places like Vietnam and Cambodia.
Among Levi's best-selling products are the 501 men's jeans, which go for between $39.99 and $49.99, according to Levi's website.
Trump also has threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico in retaliation for illegal immigration largely from Central America, across the U.S.-Mexican border. He is pushing Congress to approve the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a deal his administration reached to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Levi's also has put contingency plans in place ""not just for China but also for Mexico in the event that NAFTA gets ripped up in a moment of rage or something,"" Bergh said."

The U.S. economy added just 164,000 jobs in July, compared to 193,000 in June, which could give the Federal Reserve reason to to cut interest rates again in September. 
""Job numbers were not too far from expected, it shows the trend is slowing down. It's consistent with another rate cut either in September or October,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Increasing trade tariffs were also of concern to investors, as President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he will levy tariffs by 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, effectively broadening the scope of tariffs to cover all U.S. imports from China. Beijing warned it would retaliate.

(Reuters) - Traders on Friday kept bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will follow this week's interest-rate cut with further policy easing next month to counter any economic impact from an escalating U.S.-China trade war, even as a government report showed U.S. employers were already slowing hiring in July.
Traders of short-term interest-rate futures are now pricing in about an 80% chance of a rate-cut next month, and about a 70% chance of a further reduction in December, according CME Group's FedWatch tool that uses futures contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate to generate estimates of traders' views.
Those bets are little changed from Thursday, when President Donald Trump's surprise vow to hike taxes on Chinese imports starting Sept. 1 unleashed frantic buying in interest rate futures markets.
Only 24 hours earlier, those markets had slashed bets on future rate cuts after Fed Chair Jerome Powell described Wednesday's quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut as an insurance police rather than the start of a lengthy easing cycle.
A report Friday showed U.S. job growth slowed in July and manufacturers slashed hours for workers, but still showed the underlying labor market is healthy, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG), Newport Beach, California.
""If it weren’t for concerns about the economic situation abroad and market/political pressures, the Federal Reserve would be hard pressed to make the conventional economic arguments for further interest rate cuts in the months ahead,"" he said.
Underscoring that point, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren on Friday released a statement outlining why he dissented on the Fed's rate cut earlier this week, and why he saw little reason for further easing.
""With the unemployment rate near 50-year lows and inflation likely to rise toward the 2 percent target, and with financial stability concerns being somewhat elevated given near-record equity prices and corporate leverage, I do not see a clear and compelling case for additional monetary accommodation at this time,"" Rosengren said.
Under the Fed's communications policy, Friday is the first day after a Fed rate-setting decision that central bank Chairman Jerome Powell's colleagues are permitted to air their views.
Rosengren did not refer to trade tensions in his statement, which Powell had cited as one reason for the Fed's rate cut."

Results benefited from a $1 billion fee it received after Occidental (NYSE:OXY) Petroleum's intercepted its deal to buy Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) with a winning $38 billion bid. The termination fee added $720 million to the quarter's profit, Chevron said.
Its U.S. shale production rose 21% during the quarter, but was overshadowed by sharply weaker oil and gas prices. Like many of its rivals, Chevron also reported declining profits in its refining and chemicals units. 
Chevron abandoned its pursuit of Anadarko in May, refusing to increase its $33 billion bid, saying it would not back down from a pledge to dilute the returns it promised investors. 
The second-largest U.S. oil and natural gas producer's daily production of oil and gas rose 9.1% to 3.08 million barrels, a record for the company. Its production in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, rose 21.5% over a the same period a year ago. 
The company said it has resumed share buybacks that were suspended during its acquisition talks with Anadarko. It expects to buy $5 billion in its own shares this quarter. 
Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.31 billion, or $2.27 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $3.41 billion, or $1.78 per share. [

940,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 09:28AM ET</span>","Trump's tariffs jolt global stocks, spark rush to safer assets","By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks posted their biggest drop of 2019 on Friday and bond yields tumbled to record lows after U.S. President Donald Trump fired another trade war salvo at China, sparking a frenzied dash for safe-haven assets.
Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, escalating a bruising and protracted clash between the world's two biggest economies. China said on Friday it would take countermeasures.
The abrupt end to a truce in the trade conflict capped a critical week for global markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve delivered a widely anticipated interest rate cut but played down expectations of many more ahead.
News that Trump will make an announcement about trade with the European Union at 1745 GMT on Friday did little to soothe frayed nerves. 
Markets around the globe dived into a sea of red, with the pan-European Stoxx dropping 2% in its sharpest daily tumble of 2019. The trade-sensitive DAX and France's CAC 40 dropped 2.7%, the former hitting a two-month lows.
""The market's looking very, very nervous,"" said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, adding that Trump's move also ramped up the pressure on the Fed to deliver more rate cuts. 
""Trump didn't get the rate cut he wanted, so he's going to force (the Fed) to do that. That's frightful. And what will China do? What will the Fed do? It's hijacking of monetary policy.""
MSCI's index of world stocks dropped 0.6% as Asian bourses suffered heavy losses. Japan's Nikkei fell 2.1%, Hong Kong slumped 2.4% and China mainland stocks declined around 1.5%.
The toxic cocktail of unmet expectations for central bank policy, trade war turmoil, Brexit woes and worries over the health of the corporate sector has wiped $1 trillion off world stocks this week.
(GRAPHIC - $1 trillion wiped off global equities: https://tmsnrt.rs/33gSkzo) 
Futures pointed to no let-up for U.S. markets: S&P 500 e-minis indicated 0.5% lower while Nasdaq 100 e-minis slipped 0.9%.
Trump's announcement, which came a day after U.S. and Chinese negotiators concluded a meeting in Shanghai without much progress, marks an end to a trade truce struck in June and could further disrupt global supply chains.
The proposed levies triggered a stampede for safe-haven assets. Core euro zone bond yields tumbled, with German 10-year government bond yields dropping to an all-time low of -0.502% and the country's entire government bond yield curve turning negative for the first time ever. 
That tracked the drop in 10-year U.S. Treasuries yields to 1.832% - the lowest since Nov. 8, 2016, the day Trump was elected president.
Trump's move may force the Fed to cut rates again to protect the U.S. economy from trade-policy risks.
Although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday's cut - its first in more than a decade - was a ""mid-cycle adjustment"" and not the start of an easing cycle, markets are not fully convinced. 
Data on Friday showed U.S. jobs growth slowed in July and wages picked up moderately, providing further incentive to cut rates.
The October Fed funds rate futures have jumped to fully price in a rate cut in September, compared with only around 60% before the tariff announcement. Another 25 basis point move is priced in by December.
""In the grand scheme of things, it will become clearer and clearer that the Federal Reserve has started an easing cycle and will have no choice but to cut rates further,"" said Akira Takei, fund manager at Asset Management One.
The new tariffs would hit a swathe of consumer goods from cell phones and laptop computers to toys and footwear, at a time when the manufacturing sector is already reeling from the accumulative impact of the trade war.
The U.S. Institute for Supply Management said on Thursday its index of national factory activity fell to 51.2 last month, the lowest reading since August 2016.
In currency markets, safe haven bets took the limelight. The Japanese yen surged to 16-month high against the dollar, while the Swiss franc reached a two-year high of 1.0925 against the euro. 
The dollar softened 0.2% against a basket of currencies. [/FRX] 
""How things progress for the U.S. and the U.S. dollar will depend now much more on whether there are signs that the trade conflict is increasingly leaving a mark on the U.S. economy,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) FX analyst Esther Reichelt said.

941,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 08:49AM ET</span>","Wells Fargo Says VIX, S&P Volatility Spikes May Be Overdone","(Bloomberg) -- The tariff news-induced volatility has outdone that for equities and may be due to reverse, according to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.
The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, rose as high as 19.46 intraday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a new round of tariff hikes on Chinese imports, abruptly escalating the trade war between the two countries. It was at 18.01, up from Thursday’s close, as of 8:33 a.m. in New York. The S&P 500 posted a modest 0.9% drop on Thursday to put it only about 2.4% below the July 26 record high.
“Though the escalation in trade war tensions is not insignificant, everything would suggest that the bid to S&P vol is overdone and that vol has outpaced equities,” Pravit Chintawongvanich, an equity derivatives strategist at Wells Fargo, wrote in a note. “Consider structures which are short near-dated S&P volatility and skew.”
The VIX had stayed below 15 throughout July until the aftermath of the Federal Reserve meeting Wednesday briefly pushed it to 16.55. Things calmed down the next day, with the gauge dipping below 14, before the trade tweets from Trump propelled it as high as 19.46. The three most-traded VIX options on Thursday were calls with August expiry and strike prices of 20, 21 and 47.5.
Chintawongvanich said the overreaction in S&P 500 volatility could be a result of the large volume of call-buying on the VIX in recent days, which would have left any dealers on the other side of the trade short gamma in August and September futures. The dealers might have covered VIX futures during the rally, he said, exacerbating the volatility reaction.
So-called short gamma strategies effectively bet that the market will stay quiet."

The company said it lost a net 128,000 phone subscribers during the first quarter. Analysts were expecting a net loss of 150,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.
This helped the company post a smaller-than-expected loss and beat Wall Street estimates for revenue, sending its shares up 2.4% in trading before the bell.
""... the business still faces several structural headwinds and I remain convinced the merger with T-Mobile is the best outcome for our customers, employees, industry and all stakeholders,"" Sprint Chief Executive Officer Michel Combes said.
Sprint and T-Mobile, the No. 4 and No. 3 U.S. wireless carriers respectively, behind AT&T (N:T) and  Verizon Communications  (N:VZ) are in the process of merging with each other.
Sprint's earnings announcement comes about a week after the U.S. Justice Department approved its $26 billion merger with T-Mobile.
As part of that approval, T-Mobile agreed to divest Sprint's prepaid businesses including Boost Mobile and other assets to Dish Network Corp (O:DISH) to build out a viable fourth carrier in a couple of years.
Sprint reported a net loss attributable to the company of $111 million, or 3 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a net income of $176 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier.

Analysts were expecting a loss of 4 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total net operating revenue rose to $8.14 billion from $8.13 billion, above estimates of $8.06 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial complaints body encouraged consumers on Friday to lodge claims for mis-sold loan insurance ahead of an Aug. 29 deadline, despite criticism from some banks that a majority of the claims were ""vexatious"".
Banks have paid out more than 36 billion pounds ($43.6 billion) for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI) over the past decade in Britain's costliest retail scanadal. Regulators set the August deadline for remaining claims.
Three of Britain's biggest banks said they had been contending with a surge in PPI claims ahead of the deadline in first-half results this week, with Lloyds (L:LLOY) and  Barclays  (L:BARC) arguing the quality had gone down as volumes had risen.
Lloyds (L:LLOY), which has shelled out more than 20 billion pounds alone for PPI claims, set aside an extra 550 million pounds to cover a rise in claims.
Barclays’ Finance Director Tushar Morzaria said many of the influx of enquiries were “vexatious”.
""A lot of the PPI claims we are seeing are people who have never had a relationship with Barclays, I think the claims management companies are swamping the bank with vexatious claims,"" Morzaria said on a call with reporters on Thursday.
But Caroline Wayman, chief executive of the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), told Reuters that while fewer claims were clear contenders for compensation, consumers should not be criticized for approaching lenders.
What banks refer to as poor quality complaints were often consumers simply asking if they had been sold a policy in the first place, Wayman said.
""At points in time during this mis-selling scandal these policies were being added without people's knowledge so it's a perfectly decent question to ask,"" she said.
DEADLINE RUSH
FOS has forecast 250,000 PPI complaints in the current financial year, up from 180,507 actual complaints in the prior period and two million in total.
While the forecast appears ""slightly high"", a last minute spike was possible, Wayman said.
""There is a very good chance that we will see a rush for the finish as people get their claims in before the deadline,"" she said.
FOS only takes on complaints if a consumer feels they have not obtained redress from the financial firm first.
Over 1,000 of FOS' 3,800 staff deal with PPI complaints, with staffing next year depending on complaints in other products.
Complaints about short-term loans are forecast to make up some of the shortfall left by PPI and surge to 50,000 this year.
Wayman said the FOS was receiving complaints from consumers saddled with some 10-15 loans, some with a 100, raising questions about whether adequate affordability checks were made.
Half to two-thirds of the complaints are being upheld, an indication of fundamental problems, Wayman said.
""Those people were sometimes borrowing money to feed the kids, not borrowing money for discretionary things. That is very concerning,"" Wayman said."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. aluminum maker Novelis [NVLXC.UL] must offer concessions to European Union competition authorities by Aug. 9 to gain approval for its $2.6 billion takeover of aluminum processor Aleris [TXPACA.UL], sources close to the matter said.
Novelis, part of India's Hindalco Industries, bid for Aleris in July last year as part of its diversification into the aerospace, automotive, beverage can and construction industries among others.
The European Commission conducted a four-month investigation of the acquisition and last month set out its concerns over how the deal could hurt competition, particularly for carmakers that use the companies' products.
The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to decide on the case by Sept. 16, and Novelis declined to comment.
Novelis and Aleris defended the proposed deal before antitrust officials at a closed-door hearing last week, hoping to address EU competition concerns and secure unconditional approval.
Trade unions from Belgium and Germany also attended the hearing to voice support for the deal, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Ahead of the hearing, Novelis felt it was premature to talk about concessions but it has never ruled out the possibility, people close to the situation told Reuters last month.
The company is ready to make a written commitment to increase capacity and add 80 new jobs at the Aleris plant in Duffel, Belgium, to allay regulatory concerns that capacity may be curtailed to increase prices, a source close to the matter said.

Novelis has argued that the deal will not lead to higher prices because of competition from other aluminum and steel producers as well as customers' willingness to switch to rivals.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 07:43AM ET</span>",Police arrest eight as Hong Kong gears up for another weekend of protests,"By Felix Tam and Greg Torode
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Thousands of Hong Kong civil servants rallied on Friday night to support protesters and urge authorities to rebuild confidence in the government as escalating protests rock the Asian financial hub.
The rally is the first time government employees have promoted a demonstration in Hong Kong. The civil servants assembled peacefully with protesters in the heart of the business district, many in black masks to hide their identity. 
""I think the government should respond to the demands, instead of pushing the police to the frontline as a shield,"" said Kathy Yip, a 26-year-old government worker.
Police said they had arrested eight people, including a leading pro-independence leader, after seizing weapons and suspected bomb-making material in a raid.
A wave of protests is planned across Hong Kong this weekend, along with a mass strike on Monday across sectors such as transport, schools and corporates that could bring the city to a standstill.
The protests in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to China in 1997, pose one of the gravest populist challenges to Communist Party rulers in Beijing. 
The protests against a now suspended extradition bill, which would have seen people sent for trial in mainland courts controlled by the Communist Party, widened to demand greater democracy and the resignation of Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam.
Under Chinese rule Hong Kong has been allowed to retain extensive freedoms, such as an independent judiciary, but many residents see the extradition bill as the latest step in a relentless march toward mainland control.""At present the people of Hong Kong are already on the verge of collapse,"" a group of civil servants said in an open letter to Lam.
""Hong Kong has always been well behaved and enjoys a high degree of freedom. It is a pity that we have seen extreme oppression...""
It asked Lam to respond positively to five public demands: complete withdrawal of the extradition bill; a halt to descriptions of the protests as 'rioting'; a waiver of charges against those arrested; an independent inquiry and resumption of political reform.
The city's 180,000 civil servants must remain politically neutral, the government said on Thursday. 
""At this difficult moment, government colleagues have to stay united and work together to uphold the core values of the civil service,"" it said in a statement.
MORE PROTESTS PLANNED 
Hundreds of medical workers also demonstrated on Friday to protest against the government's handling of situation. Large-scale protests are planned for the weekend in Mong Kok, Tseung Kwan O and Western districts.
Clashes between protesters and police have become increasingly violent. Police have been criticized for excessive use of force and failing to protect protesters from attacks by what opposition politicians suspected to be criminal gangs.
In a warning to protesters, China's People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong on Wednesday released a video of ""anti-riot"" exercises and its top brass warned violence was ""absolutely impermissible"". 
The PLA has remained in barracks since protests started in April, leaving Hong Kong's police force to deal with protests.
Police said seven men and a woman, aged between 24 and 31, were arrested on Friday after a raid on a building in the New Territories district of Sha Tin, where police seized weapons and suspected petrol bombs. Making or possessing explosives illegally can carry a sentence of up to 14 years in jail.
The police may arrest more people as the investigations unfold, police officer Li Kwai Wah said, adding, ""Recently we are very worried about the escalating violence."" 
Andy Chan, a founder of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party that was banned last September, was among those arrested. His arrest prompted about 100 protesters to surround a police station to demand his release, television footage showed.
On Wednesday, 44 people were charged in a Hong Kong court with rioting over a recent protest near Beijing's main representative office in the heart of the city.

The escalating protests, which have shut government offices, blocked roads and disrupted business, is taking a toll of the city’s economy and scaring off tourists.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 06:32AM ET</span>","Toyota posts 8.7% rise in first-quarter operating profit, boosted by better sales","By Naomi Tajitsu and Kevin Buckland
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) lowered its annual profit forecast while Honda Motor Co (T:7267) turned in a double-digit decline in quarterly earnings as a resurgent yen hurt two of Japan's biggest automakers.
The quarterly earnings unveiled on Friday by Japan's biggest and third-biggest automakers highlight how ""safe-haven"" demand for the currency - buoyed by global uncertainties and falling U.S. interest rates - could eat into profits at Japanese exporters in the months to come. 
A strengthening yen hurts Japanese automakers as cars exported from Japan become more expensive, while it also decreases the value of earnings made overseas. 
Toyota cut its operating profit forecast for the year ending March 2020 by nearly 6% to 2.4 trillion yen ($22.4 billion), from a previous forecast of 2.55 trillion yen. The 2.7% drop on the year means it will snap a three-year run of rising profit.
""We have factored in cost reduction efforts for the year, but there are still some uncertainties. We cannot be complacent,"" Toyota Operating Officer Kenta Kon told reporters at a results briefing.
It expects the yen to trade around 106 to the U.S. dollar and 121 to the euro in the current financial year, from a previous assumption of 110 yen and 125 yen, respectively.
For the quarter just ended, however, Toyota posted an 8.7% rise in operating profit to 741.9 billion yen ($6.93 billion), its highest since the September 2015 quarter, helped by a slight increase in global vehicle sales.
(For a link to an interactive graph on Toyota's financial performance, click on https://tmsnrt.rs/2Xzf8Xl)
But the stronger domestic currency took a toll on Honda's profits. Japan's No. 3 automaker posted an operating income of 252.4 billion yen for the April-June period, down 16% from 299.3 billion yen a year ago and lagging analyst forecasts.
Still, Honda reiterated its forecast for a 6% increase in operating profit to 770 billion yen for this fiscal year, and said it expected the yen to average around 110 to the U.S. dollar, unchanged from its previous forecast.

GLOBAL IMPACT 
Easing demand for cars has also dented earnings at Honda and other automakers including Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), prompting the latter two to announce job cuts and plant closures.
An escalating trade war between China and the United States, the world's top two auto markets, and slowing economic growth have prompted a broad-based sales downturn in the global auto sector.
""Conditions in the U.S. market continue to be severe, including the effects of the trade friction between the U.S. and China,"" Honda Executive Vice President Seiji Kuraishi told reporters, adding that tensions could also have a negative impact in China, where demand for cars is already slowing.
""How the Chinese market reacts to the U.S.-China trade friction will be key to setting our business strategy.""
A downturn in the global auto sector could weigh on profits just as automakers invest heavily in new technologies including electric cars, autonomous driving technologies and ride-sharing services to survive a industry shift away from car ownership.
Toyota has been pouring money in ride-sharing services including Uber (N:UBER), Grab and Didi Chuxing while deepening alliances with SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) to develop on-demand transportation services in Japan, to position itself as a provider of mobility services. 
Investors have backed this strategy, pushing Toyota shares roughly 10% higher this year, outperforming its domestic rivals.

Honda too has been scrambling to reinvent itself to compete with tech firms such as Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and Uber, by expanding partnerships and investing in General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cruise self-driving vehicle unit.

953,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 05:23AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Trump's Tariff Threat Sends Markets on Race to the Bottom,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- It’s a race to the bottom for Europe’s stock markets on Friday, as Donald Trump’s escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict threatens to increase the pressure on the European economy.
That’s in addition to all the familiar victims of the trade conflict, such as the automotive sector, U.K.-listed miners of the base metals that have fed China’s industrial boom for the last 30 years, and banks such as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and UBS (SIX:UBSG), which have geared their business models to the growth of wealth management in China.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Ulrich Stephan appeared pessimistic that the threatened tariffs could be avoided, pointing to what he called “the cross-party consensus in the U.S. that accuses the People’s Republic of unfair trading.”
By 4:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the benchmark Euro STOXX 600 was down 2.2% at 378.98, its lowest since mid-June. The trade-sensitive German DAX and French CAC 40 led the race to the bottom, both losing 2.8%, while the Swiss and Danish markets outperformed, keeping losses to just over 1% each.
Among those that defied the general gloom were International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG), the parent of British Airways and Iberia, which rose 2.4% after posting stronger-than-expected earnings and repeating its desire to appeal a heavy fine for a past data breach that exposed the details of customers.
Natixis was the best performer in a banking sector that responded badly to an increased likelihood of more margin-squeezing interest rate cuts from central banks worldwide. 
Natixis said client flows at its fund management subsidiary H20 had stabilized in July after a surge in outflows that followed revelations about the extent of its investments in private debt issued by a controversial German financier.

954,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 04:31AM ET</span>",European shares tank after Trump threatens new China tariffs,"By Susan Mathew and Medha Singh
(Reuters) - European stock indexes dived by as much as 2% on Friday as U.S. President Donald Trump's warning of new tariffs on China sank stock markets worldwide and sent trade-sensitive sectors like mining and carmakers into a tailspin.
Abruptly ending a temporary trade truce between the two countries, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese exports to the United States from September 1.
Spooking investors further, Bloomberg reported that Trump is scheduled to make a statement on trade with the European Union at 1745 GMT on Friday.
That sent the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) down 1.9% to a six-week low, with the basic material sector plunging 3.9%, and the auto (SXAP) and tech sectors (SX8P) sliding 2.7%.
""The announcement will only serve to create additional downward pressure on business confidence,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management wrote in a note.
""If businesses stop hiring (as a result), this would greatly increase the risk of a recession.""
Chipmakers Siltronic (DE:WAFGn), Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicro (MI:STM) and ASML (AS:ASML) dropped by 4% to 6% while France's CAC 40 (FCHI) and Germany's DAX (GDAXI), often regarded as among the most sensitive markets to trade nerves, lost around 2.3%.
Most of Europe's main markets were set for their worst week since a slide in May, when a sudden break-down in trade talks between the two countries hammered markets.
A rally since then had been fueled by hopes that major central banks would adopt looser monetary policy to offset the trade war's impact on growth, but the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve both disappointed investors last month with stances that were more cautious than expected.
Adding to the auto sector's woes, Italian tyremaker Pirelli (MI:PIRC) slipped 4.6% after cutting revenue guidance for the second time this year, joining a string of suppliers hit by a broader auto industry downturn.
""We now see a higher risk that tariffs could also be placed on auto imports,"" UBS's Haefele wrote. ""Back in May, Trump announced that a decision on auto tariffs would be delayed by six months to allow time for negotiations, and it appears that little progress has been made since then.""
Corporate earnings for the second three months of the year continue to pour in. French lender  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) slipped 5.3% after it said that a weak performance at its corporate and investment unit had weighed on its profits.
German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) fell 2.7% and was among the biggest drags on STOXX 600, despite posting a better-than-expected quarterly net profit and confirming its full-year profit target."

Japan's No.3 automaker posted operating income of 252.4 billion yen ($2.36 billion) for the April-June period, compared with 299.3 billion yen a year ago and an average forecast of 246.9 billion yen from seven analysts polled by Refinitiv.
The company's U.S. sales fell to 407,000 vehicles over the three-month period, from 425,000 vehicles a year earlier.
It lowered its forecast for global sales in the year to March 2020 to 5.11 million vehicles, from its prior projection of 5.16 million and a record 5.323 million sold last year.
Honda, however, reiterated its forecast for a 6% increase in operating profit to 770 billion yen for this fiscal year.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) moved closer to taking a controlling stake in its Chinese securities joint venture (JV) after picking up a 2% share for $54 million, exchange filings show.
Huaxin Securities signed an equity transfer contract on Aug. 1 to move the 2% stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities to the U.S. bank, according to a statement dated Aug. 2 filed to the Shanghai Stock Exchange by Huaxin's parent, Shanghai China Fortune Co (SS:600621).
Morgan Stanley, which currently owns 49% of the JV, was the only bidder, the filing said.
An unnamed buyer will pay 376.2 million yuan ($54.24 million) for the 2% stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, according to a separate notice on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange website dated Aug. 1.
The transfer still has to be approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and the JV's business registration license must be changed by the Ministry of Commerce to reflect its foreign ownership, the filing added.
Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, whose offerings include underwriting and sponsoring of stock and bond sales, told the CSRC earlier this year about plans to change its equity holdings, Reuters reported in June, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The outcome of Sino-U.S. trade talks could, however, impact the approval timeline, the people said at that time, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to discuss regulatory matters with media.
U.S. President Donald Trump vowed, on Thursday, to impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, escalating the bruising trade war between the world's largest economies and jolting financial markets.
If the transfer is approved, Morgan Stanley will join rivals  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) and UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) in owning controlling stakes in onshore securities JVs in China under liberalized rules announced in 2017.
Lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration for Wall Street banks, and became a key issue in Washington's push to persuade Beijing to open up its market for wider foreign participation.
Management control would allow foreign banks, including Morgan Stanley, to offer more services through their JVs and potentially leverage their global networks to win China market share, bankers have previously said."

Campbell and KKR will enter into a long-term licensing arrangement for the exclusive rights to use certain Campbell brands, including Campbell's, Swanson, V8, Prego, Chunky and Campbell's Real Stock, in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and other select markets, the company said.
""This was a thorough and complex process in which we considered many options,"" Campbell Chief Executive Officer Mark Clouse said.
""By applying almost $3 billion of divestiture net proceeds to reduce debt, Campbell's balance sheet will be stronger and capable of supporting our plan to grow our focused and differentiated portfolio,"" he said.
KKR & Co said last week it was buying Campbell's Arnott's that will give it ownership of top-selling biscuit brands such as Tim Tam.
Campbell put its international unit and 'Fresh' unit up for sale last year as it wanted to focus on its core North American businesses and reduce debt. It was also under pressure from investors to improve profitability and stock performance.

961,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 02:13AM ET</span>","Asia Stocks Tumble, Yen Gains on U.S. Tariff Shock: Markets Wrap","(Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks tumbled and U.S. futures dropped after President Donald Trump announced a new round of tariff hikes on Chinese imports. The yen extended gains after the biggest jump in more than two years.
Japanese benchmarks fell more than 2%. South Korean shares hit their lows of the day after Japan took its own trade-restriction move, directed at Korea. Chinese and Hong Kong stocks also slumped, though Australian equities saw a more modest retreat. Ten-year U.S. yields fell further after tumbling Thursday, while U.S. stock futures fell after the S&P 500 Index’s biggest two-day drop since May. China’s onshore yuan hit the weakest since November.
Elsewhere, crude oil clawed back a fraction of its 8% slide on Thursday, amid concern the U.S. plans for 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports will hurt global demand. Lenders led losses on U.S. equity benchmarks but the declines spread across sectors as a draft list of $300 billion worth of targets published by the Trump administration in May included a raft of consumer and technology goods, including most of Apple’s major products such the IPhone, along with toys, footwear and clothing. The new tariffs are set to kick in Sept. 1. Trump alsosaid the levies could be raised beyond 25%.
“We’re just seeing the beginning of what the market reaction’s going to look like,” given the breadth of the impact of the new tariffs, said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp.
Traders increased bets on Fed cuts to another half point this year. That was just a day after some disappointment with the Federal Reserve chief casting doubt about a long cycle of interest-rate cuts had sent yields higher.
“The question for investors is whether this is the first step in a series of escalations or a negotiating stance that will compel China to make concessions and the Fed to ease,” said Steve Englander, global head of FX research at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank. “A risk for investors is that asset-market effects would be largely reversed if the tariff increase were delayed or canceled. If the president can elicit concessions from both China and the Fed, it would be a double win from his perspective.”

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.7% and 1.6% respectively. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index plunged 2.3%.
Overnight, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he would impose a 10% tariff on a further $300 billion in Chinese imports. It will become effective on Sep 1. The new taxes could go “well beyond” 25%, he added.
Prior to the move, a total of $250 billion of China-made products were already subject to a 25% import charge.
“I think they want to try and make a deal with us, but I’m not sure,” Trump said in a Thursday evening rally in Cincinnati. “Until such time that there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China.”

963,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 01:08AM ET</span>",Earnings Malaise Set to Keep South African Stocks in Bargain Bin,"(Bloomberg) -- South African stocks look cheap right now, by one clear measure at least. And the evidence suggests they will stay that way.
Shares in Africa’s most-industrialized nation are trading at the biggest discount to U.S. stocks in more than a decade. The S&P 500 Index has stormed ahead in 2019, rising 20%, with tech stocks powering the advance. That’s pushed price-earnings above their five-year averages and widened the gap over the South African benchmark to the widest since March 2009.
South African stocks have climbed 8% this year, just edging ahead of their emerging-market peers. But that’s largely down to strength in global tech investor Naspers Ltd., gains in international luxury goods seller Richemont and a rally in some miners and precious metals producers. For the rest, investors have largely shunned a market hobbled by a faltering economy and anemic earnings prospects for its companies.
“The overall South African market has been rising, driven by the exceptional outperformance of Naspers, and from rallies in single commodity resources shares,” Adrian Cloete, a portfolio manager at PSG Wealth in Cape Town, said by phone. “But it has been a narrow rise, with only a few of the companies participating in the gains. The others, particularly the South Africa Inc. stocks, have been left behind.”
The skewed performance has left South African price earnings ratios muted, with Johannesburg stocks trading at 12.5 times estimated earnings, below the five-year average of 14.6. Domestically focused companies are trying to eke out profits in an economy that contracted by the most in a decade in the first quarter, while unemployment’s running at the highest rate in 11 years and fragile consumer confidence is recovering from the lowest levels since 2017.
“South Africa currently falls into the value-trap category because there is no earnings growth on the domestic stocks,” said Henre Herselman, a derivatives trader at Johannesburg-based Anchor Private Clients. “Stock prices will follow earnings and until that changes, my sense is that the metric will remain cheap.”
Arqaam Capital strategists wrote this week that there is little upside for South African stocks until the bigger economic picture improves. Massive government bailouts of the embattled state power utility will increase the country’s fiscal deficit and makes the loss of South Africa’s last remaining investment-grade rating from Moody’s Investors Service more likely, they said in a note.
A potential silver lining for the Johannesburg market appeared lost this week, dashed by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. A series of interest rate cuts in the U.S. could have sent more dollars in search of yield in emerging markets such as South Africa. But the U.S. central bank on Wednesday signaled that its first reduction in a decade may not be followed by many more.
Rather than driving inflows, investors have been moving in the opposite direction of late: foreigners were net sellers of South African stocks in seven successive sessions, as of Wednesday. And that’s a small slice of a larger foreign retreat from the country’s markets this year, as outflows from stocks and bonds have just reached $5 billion.
“As soon as people think things will improve, then investors, who are forward looking, will start investing in shares that are driven by the local economy,” Cloete said. “At the moment, people are quite gloomy and that is reflected in the share prices. We need a change in sentiment.”"

965,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 12:19AM ET</span>",What Analysts Are Saying About Trump's Fresh China Tariff Threat,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s yuan is likely to test the 7 per dollar level sooner than previously expected after Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to escalate the trade war, which could also prompt more easing by Beijing to support the economy, analysts say. The threat will weigh on stocks too, presenting buying opportunities if the benchmark falls below a key level, they said.
The yuan fell as much as 0.76% to 6.9394 per dollar Friday morning, its weakest since November, while the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2% to 2,851.44, the lowest in nearly two months. Technology stocks were among the hardest hit. The yield on 10-year Chinese government bonds slid 4 basis points, the most in a month, to 3.11%.
Chinese Stocks Slide With Yuan as Trump Shatters Market Calm
Here’s a roundup of views from analysts:
“Expectations that the yuan will remain stable are shattered,” said Zhou Hao, a senior emerging market economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Singapore. “Once the era of low volatility has ended, many traders will have to stop loss. Investors will test the PBOC’s resolve to defend 7 today or in the coming days.”
“The risk of the yuan breaking 7 has risen visibly” and could happen any time, said Christy Tan, head of markets strategy at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Singapore. The central bank won’t allow disorderly movements in the currency.
Beijing may be tempted to allow further depreciation to support growth, said Ken Cheung, a senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. The Politburo’s emphasis on stability means China is likely to keep a smooth pace of depreciation, and given concerns over capital outflow risk, “we do not expect the onshore yuan to breach the 7 handle immediately.”
RATES
The odds have built for more Fed rate cuts, while China’s economic growth will likely drop below 6% next year, said Koon How Heng, head of markets strategy at United Overseas Bank Ltd. “I’m not so worried about Chinese outflows, but this may well intensify the relocation of manufacturing capital away from southern China into various ASEAN countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia,” he said.
The escalation in trade tension adds downside risk to growth, which is generally bond supportive, said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac Banking Corp. “More importantly, China is likely to focus on supporting domestic growth and the market may expect more liquidity and credit support,” she said. “The yield differential remains favorable for China government bonds.”
The new tariffs impact the growth outlook much more, because many high-tech consumer goods are included, said Zhaopeng Xing, a markets economist at ANZ Bank China, adding that the yield on China’s 10-year government bond could fall another 10-15 basis points to 3.0%.
STOCKS
Most people were expecting some compromise in the latest round of trade talks, said Banny Lam, head of research at Ceb International Inv Corp. Selling pressure could be more intense as it is Friday and investors are uncertain about what may happen over the weekend. “China should be really tough in response to the U.S. moves,” he said.
There’s a higher likelihood that China will use fiscal tools over the weekend to bolster confidence, said Wang Zhihong, managing director at Whiterock Asset Management Co. “We will increase our short position on industrial commodities,” he said.
It could be an opportunity to buy if the Shanghai Composite falls below 2,700, especially consumer and infrastructure-related stocks, said Kenny Wen, strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co. “The Chinese government may boost infrastructure spending and tax cuts to boost domestic consumption to offset the tariff impact.”
Sun Jianbo, president of China Vision Capital Management in Beijing, said he’s waiting to bottom fish consumer electronics stocks after the tariff news. “The trade war is going to last for a while, so our internal consensus has always been buying stocks after the tensions ratchet up and selling after it cools down a bit. Things can’t go too extreme on either side.”
“There’s no need to get over-pessimistic as the U.S. can’t afford to lose the China market and the trades will go on even after more tariffs,” Sun said. “Stocks in the consumer electronics supply chain will drop for sure, but as long as their earnings growth potential remains intact, we would start buying after the correction.”"
966,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 11:06PM ET</span>",Boeing to change 737 MAX flight-control software to address flaw: sources,"By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co plans further changes to the software architecture of the 737 MAX flight-control system to address a flaw discovered after a test in June, two people briefed on the matter said late on Thursday.
The redesign, first reported by the Seattle Times, involves using and receiving input from both flight control computers rather than one.
The move comes in response to an effort to address a problem discovered in June during a Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) simulator test.
This is on top of earlier announced changes to take input from both angle-of-attack sensors in the MCAS anti-stall system linked to two deadly crashes that led to a global grounding of the plane.
Boeing still hopes to complete the software redesign by the end of September to submit to the FAA for approval, the sources said.
For decades, 737 models have used only one of the flight control computers for each flight, with the system switching to the other computer on the following flight, according to people familiar with the plane's design.
The FAA said in June that it had identified a new risk that would need to be addressed before the plane could be ungrounded.
Under a scenario where a specific fault in a microprocessor caused an uncommanded movement of the plane's horizontal tail, it took pilots too long to recognize a loss of control known as runaway stabilizer, a Boeing official said at the time.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told analysts last month that he was confident the 737 MAX would be back in service as early as October after a certification flight in ""the September time frame""
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and Air Canada, however, have taken the 737 MAX off their schedules until January.
The FAA declined to comment on the Seattle Times report. Boeing did not respond immediately to a request for comment."

The trial delay and a ruling giving states ample room to seek evidence were additional wins for the deal's opponents, given the difficulty and cost of pursuing an acquisition during a lengthy court fight. 
""Every day we can't integrate puts us a day behind the competitive race,"" David Gelfand, a lawyer for T-Mobile, told the court, objecting to the postponement.
With Texas, there are now 14 states and the District of Columbia seeking to stop the merger of the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless companies. 
""We welcome Texas' resolve to block this anticompetitive merger, and are pleased to announce that Attorney General Ken Paxton will assume a key leadership role in this case, along with (California) Attorney General (Xavier) Becerra and myself,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement. 
The U.S. Justice Department has signed off on the merger and the Federal Communications Commission has indicated that it will formally approve the proposed transaction.
Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger, who is assisting Judge Victor Marrero in the case, ordered the delay during a hearing on Thursday after the states said they needed time to consider a deal struck by the Justice Department approving the merger with the sale of some assets.
The case had been expected to be heard beginning on Oct. 7, and was expected to last two to three weeks. It is now set for Dec. 9.
Under the Justice Department deal announced a week ago, the companies would divest Sprint's prepaid businesses, including Boost Mobile, to satellite television company Dish Network Corp, and provide it with access to 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations. That deal is worth about $5 billion.
Prepaid wireless phones are generally used by lower-income earners who cannot pass a credit check.
The states involved in the lawsuit have said that the divestiture negotiated by the federal government to position Dish as a fourth wireless carrier was inadequate to protect consumers.
The state attorneys general asked for 150 total hours for deposition, while T-Mobile and Sprint argued it should be limited to 60. Lehrburger ruled that the states would have 140 hours to depose potential witnesses.
Lehrburger also ruled that documents from outside parties would be classified as confidential or highly confidential, and that only T-Mobile and Sprint's external counsel could have access to the latter.

""You're talking about information that goes to the heart of competition and business dealings,"" Lehrburger said, in response to arguments from T-Mobile that its inhouse counsel needed to be closely involved.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 07:41PM ET</span>",No rash moves: Kao aims to bolster 'Made in Japan' cachet in China diaper market,"By Ritsuko Ando and Pei Li
TOKYO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Like many urban Chinese professionals with young children, Shenzhen-based fintech executive Jacob Cao is a fan of Japanese diaper brands including Kao Corp's (T:4452) Merries.
While he knows some Merries are made in China, with little difference in quality compared with higher-priced versions from Japan, he prefers the latter.
""I just get the feeling the Japan-made ones are better, to be honest,"" said the father of 20-month old twin girls.
The perception that Japanese baby products are superior owes much to Chinese aversion to homegrown goods after a tainted milk formula scandal in 2008. It has served Kao well, propelling it to the No.2 spot in the world's biggest diaper market despite a late entry in 2009.
But Kao's sales have been hit after a clampdown by Beijing last year on ""daigou"" merchants, who buy goods abroad for resale online in China. More reliant than rivals on daigou sales, its baby diaper sales tumbled 14% in the first half compared to the same period a year earlier, the company said this week.
To preserve and bolster the made-in-Japan cachet, Kao began selling a premium line of ""Tender Love"" Merries in June, produced in its home market but only for sale in China.
Made of soft, silky fabric, they cost 4.9 yuan per diaper or roughly 200 yuan ($29) for a medium-sized pack of 40, more than double the price of standard Merries and considered too expensive to market in Japan.
""Our strategy in China is to go for the premium market. We don't want to go for volume,"" said Tomoharu Matsuda, Kao managing executive officer in charge of consumer products.
Promoting made-in-Japan products comes amid emerging competition from Chinese brands in premium diapers and despite Kao's longer-term goal of producing all diapers for the Chinese market in China, which would help it manufacture and distribute more economically.
Baby diapers make up roughly half of Kao's sales in its ""human healthcare"" division, which in turn accounted for 18% of $14 billion in revenue last year.
P&G SHARE LOSS
Estimated to be worth some $9 billion in annual sales, China's baby diaper market is five times bigger than Japan's and is expected to show a double-digit compound annual growth rate through 2023, according to research firm Euromonitor.
In the past five years, Kao has doubled its China market share to 10%, mainly at the expense of Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), which has seen its share tumble to 19% from 33%. Huggies maker Kimberly-Clark Corp (N:KMB) has 8.6% and Japan's Unicharm Corp (T:8113) has taken 7% with its MamyPoko and Moony brands.
P&G, which introduced China to disposable diapers in the 1990s when most babies there were wearing open-crotch pants, has also sought to benefit from the made-in-Japan cachet.
Two years ago it began production in western Japan for its brand ""Ichiban"" - the Japanese word for ""best"". Sold mainly in China, they are priced at around 2.0 yuan per diaper.
Unicharm opened a new factory in Japan's southern island of Kyushu this year to bolster production of diapers for the Chinese market.
But it is taking a slightly different tack from Kao. In recent months it began making a premium Moony diaper in China, which are sold for 3.5-4 yuan each, in line with pricing for existing imports from Japan.
""Demand for 'Made in Japan' still exists, but needs are diversifying,"" said Unicharm spokesman Hitoshi Watanabe. ""Consumers are no longer making decisions based solely on where something's made.""
Kao's Matsuda agrees that change in consumer sentiment is coming, but the company remains wary of making hasty moves. He noted made-in-Japan Merries diapers, which cost 1.8 yuan each, are still more popular than those made at its Anhui factory which sell for 1.6 yuan each.
""We'll need to carefully consider how the market develops. For now, there are people who still say it has to be made in Japan,"" he said."
969,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 07:36PM ET</span>","Free-spending consumers lift company profits, but Trump tariffs now loom","By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to slap new tariffs on Chinese imports comes on the heels of unexpectedly strong second-quarter results for automakers, consumer products companies and restaurant chains, boosted by spending on high-end products
Several major U.S. companies, from General Motors (NYSE:GM) to KFC-owner Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), defied analysts' sluggish earnings forecasts. 
Refinitiv analysts said on Thursday that they expect quarterly earnings growth of 2.5% for S&P 500 companies, compared with the 0.4% decline they had predicted in mid-July. At the time negative second-quarter outlooks outnumbered positive ones by 3.8 to 1, while the average ratio for the prior four quarters was 1.9 to 1, according to Refinitiv data.
But the rosy outlook may be short-lived. After Trump said on Thursday he would impose an additional 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports starting Sept. 1, four large retail trade groups warned that the action would hurt consumer purchases, raise prices further and limit hiring.
Even so, consumers would be unlikely to see higher prices when they start shopping for the holiday season, which begins in November, as a result of the new tariffs. Most retailers have already purchased their holiday-season merchandise, and the inventory for the most part has already arrived at U.S. ports and warehouses.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged at a 4.3% rate in the second quarter, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2017. That followed a rather lackluster 1.1% growth rate in the first quarter, blamed on a 35-day partial shutdown of the government.
Quarterly results from companies catering to consumers showed shoppers flocking to high-end SUVs and ordering more fried chicken on mobile phones. Even products like face creams, potato chips and laundry detergent, which have become more expensive due to surging commodities costs, sold well.
Shares in Kellogg surged 12% on Thursday after the company's quarterly results beat estimates on strong demand in North America for its increasingly pricy Pringles, frozen Eggo waffles and meatless Morningstar burgers. Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane told Reuters that sales growth in North America was due to investments in marketing and new products such as Eggo French Toast.
Similarly, Procter & Gamble's stock touched a record high on Tuesday after the company reported strong demand for skincare and detergent products in the second quarter even though it increased prices to offset surging raw material costs. P&G, whose brands include Olay and Tide, said the price hikes contributed 3 percentage points to a 7% jump in organic sales and said North America sales rose by the high-single digits.
The consumer goods industry has rushed to revamp products and roll out premium ones to justify higher prices and compete with cheaper, increasingly popular store-brand products from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Kroger (NYSE:KR).
Nestle, the world's No. 1 consumer goods company whose brands include Nescafe coffee pods and Lean Cuisine, also raised prices during the quarter. In July, confectionary company Hershey said it would hike wholesale prices by 10% on its single-serve products, which account for about a third of total sales. The Reese's Pieces maker, which had already raised prices on other products this year, beat quarterly earnings forecasts when it reported last week, even though price hikes ate into volumes.
Consumers are also splurging on cars, even as prices have risen to near an all-time high, at $37,169 per vehicle according to Kelley Blue Book. General Motors shares hit a more than one-year high on Thursday as its redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks helped boost second-quarter profits by $1 billion.
The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), which counts Walmart, Target  and Home Depot  among its members, said the tariffs will raise prices for everyday items like clothing, toys, home goods and electronics.

""This new 10% tariff is a direct hit on consumer products and family budgets,"" Hun Quach, RILA's vice president of international trade, said in a statement.

970,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 07:31PM ET</span>","PG&E negotiates price cuts on five solar, battery contracts","(Reuters) - PG&E Corp (N:PCG) on Thursday told a U.S. bankruptcy judge that it had reached agreements to cut prices by at least 10% on five power contracts, according to court papers.
The company said it had reached the deals with three energy generators and storage providers, including Recurrent Energy, a unit of Canadian Solar Inc, as well as energy storage providers mNOC AERS LLC and Hummingbird Energy Storage LLC.
PG&E said in court papers on Wednesday that it ""strongly disagrees"" with a suggestion in a Wall Street Journal article that the utility company knowingly deferred maintenance on equipment that caused California's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's modern history.
PG&E's bankruptcy poses a major threat to up to $42 billion of power contracts, mainly for renewable solar and wind energy. Those agreements are critical to California's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting its aggressive climate goals and what happens to them in bankruptcy is being closely watched by both investors and state officials.
The utility estimates that it can save about $20 million from the negotiated discounts, PG&E said, adding that the companies had asked PG&E to renegotiate their contracts to stem the uncertainty and the risk of obtaining the financing needed to complete underlying projects.
The deals include three solar projects by Recurrent and two battery storage projects.
A U.S. bankruptcy court ruling in June that a federal regulator had no say in whether utility PG&E may reject its power purchase agreements if it chooses to while in bankruptcy.
Power producers NextEra Inc (N:NEE), Consolidated Edison Inc (N:ED) and Calpine Corp, who also hold major power contracts with PG&E, said then they will appeal that decision."
971,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 06:53PM ET</span>",FTC probes Facebook's acquisition practices - WSJ,"By Katie Paul and Jan Wolfe
(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) acquisitions were aimed at buying up potential rivals before they could become a threat to the social media company, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.
The company's acquisition practices are the main focus of the probe, as the FTC looks into Facebook buying technology-based startups to keep them from challenging it, the report said.
The world's largest social network has purchased nearly 90 companies since 2003, according to data provided by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI). Those include messaging service WhatsApp and image sharing app Instagram, both of which have since grown into social behemoths in their own right.
Facebook last week said the FTC had opened an antitrust investigation in June looking into the areas of ""social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications.""
Both FTC and Facebook, whose shares Facebook shares fell 0.77% declined to comment on the report.
The U.S. Justice Department said on July 23 it was opening a broad review of major digital technology firms, looking into whether they engage in anticompetitive practices, a clear signal that President Donald Trump's administration is stepping up its scrutiny of the industry.
In June, Reuters reported that the FTC and the Justice Department, which enforce U.S. antitrust laws, have divided oversight over the big four tech companies, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook under the watch of the FTC, and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google under the Justice Department.
Last month, Facebook settled an FTC probe into allegations of inappropriately sharing data of 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook will pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine. 
The company has increasingly relied on its acquisitions to power growth in recent years, as the number of new users signing up for its core ""blue app"" has tapered off in lucrative markets. According to its most recent figures, more than 2.7 billion people use one of Facebook's family of apps each month.
While Facebook does not release user or revenue figures for each service, executives presenting the company's earnings last week cited Instagram as a key driver of ad impression growth, the company's main source of revenue.
George Hay, a professor of antitrust law at Cornell University and a former Justice Department lawyer, said the FTC's investigation of Facebook is likely to focus on section two of the Sherman Act, which makes it unlawful to acquire monopoly power through improper means.
Facebook will likely argue that there were valid, pro-consumer justifications for its acquisitions, and Hay said it may be difficult for the FTC to prove the transactions undermined competition.
""It is a possible theory, but it is not a compelling theory,"" Hay said. ""I think the FTC will do a thorough job but it is not obvious to me they will build a case out of it.""
In Washington, Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed growing concern about the size of the largest tech firms and their market power. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook and unwinding prior acquisitions.
In July, the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel pressed executives from the four firms about their competitive practices and noted that Google, Facebook, Amazon had a rising share of key markets.
Members of Congress have also expressed concern about Facebook's control of vast amounts of user data, citing the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a string of other privacy breaches.

It is rare for the U.S. government to seek to undo a consummated deal. The most famous case in recent memory is the government's effort to break up  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact.

972,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 06:41PM ET</span>",Investor trade groups back U.S. SEC plan opposed by exchanges,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A disputed plan by U.S. regulators to study how stock exchange fees and incentives affect brokers' trading habits is in the best interest of investors and should go forward, trade groups representing many of the largest asset managers said in a legal filing on Thursday.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ""Transaction Fee Pilot"" is aimed at evaluating how rebate payments most stock exchanges make to brokers for stock orders that add liquidity influences brokers' behavior. The regulator delayed its start date in March after the three largest exchange operators sued to kill the pilot.
The exchanges say rebates help attract liquidity, while also compensating brokers, especially market makers, for taking the risk of providing two-sided bid and ask prices for others to trade against. Without them, bid-ask spreads will widen out, making it more costly to trade, the exchanges have argued.
The system has many critics.
""The transaction fee pilot is a constructive and long overdue first step toward fixing an outdated and byzantine pricing model that is badly in need of reform,"" the Investment Company Institute (ICI) and the Council of Institutional Investors (CII) said in a joint amicus brief in support of the SEC. ""It should be allowed to proceed.""
The trade groups, which represent institutional investors managing tens of trillions of dollars worth of assets, said the pricing system gives brokers an incentive to send customer orders to the exchanges that pay the most, even if those customer orders might get better results elsewhere.
Collectively, Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ), Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE) and New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), paid out about $2.5 billion last year in rebates, which can be key drivers in attracting market share.
ICI and CII also said the system increases market complexity by fueling the proliferation of trading venues that offer various pricing models catering to high-speed traders, which make up half the trading volume in the market, looking to harvest rebates.
NYSE operates five stock exchanges, Cboe four, and Nasdaq three. The need to connect to all of these exchanges raises costs for investors, the trade groups said.
The pilot, which was recommended by an SEC-appointed committee of market experts as well as the U.S. Treasury in a report in late 2017, would in some cases ban the rebates altogether for some stocks and lower exchange transaction fees."

The president said the threat resulted from a failure of China to buy more agricultural goods from the United States. The tariff threat was also a reflection of Trump Administration's frustration that China doesn't feel the urgency to cut a trade deal. Talks resumed this week after falling apart in May. No deal was reached, however.
The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials were both off about 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.8%.
But that's only part of the picture. The S&P 500's swing from its high Thursday to current levels was about 60 points. The Dow had been up as many as 311 points before plunging nearly 550 points. The Nasdaq's swing was 135 points.

(Reuters) - A Bayer (DE:BAYGN) executive on Thursday said the company was closely watching the plant-based meat market which has seen booming demand in recent years, adding that Bayer could potentially enter the market as an alternative protein source provider.
""They are sourcing different types of crops and that also could create opportunity for us, being a company that is a plant-breeding company,"" Bob Reiter, Bayer's head of research and development at the company's crop science division, said in reference to plant-based meat companies.
Reiter made the remarks at an investor event in St. Louis, Missouri in response to a question by an analyst who wanted to know what impact the growth of plant-based meat substitutes would have on the company's business.
Meat alternatives have seen booming demand as consumers are looking to add more plant-based protein to their diet, amid growing concerns about health risks from eating meat, animal welfare and the environmental hazards of intensive animal farming.
Companies including Beyond Meat (O:BYND) and Impossible Foods, and even traditional meat producers including  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN),  Maple Leaf Foods Inc  (TO:MFI) and Perdue Farms are cashing in on the trend, selling sausages, burgers and imitation ground beef largely made from pea protein or soy.
Analysts say there are no signs of the meat alternatives market slowing, with nearly 40% of consumers trying to add more plant-based protein to their diet, according to research group Mintel.
Germany-based Bayer, which acquired seed and pesticides maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in a $63 billion deal last year, is the world's largest seed and pesticides company by sales, leading the market in corn, soybean and cereal seed sales.
Reiter on Thursday said that in order for plant-based companies to produce at scale and succeed, they require efficient sources of amino acids and carbohydrates, which will bring them around to row crops that can be tilled and cultivated by machinery.
""We're not going to scale peas to get to 10% of the alternative meat market,"" Reiter said.
Beyond Meat's latest burger is made from peas, brown rice, sunflower seeds and mung beans. Its chief executive, Ethan Brown, in the past said the company was exploring new protein sources, saying there are an ""almost endless number of crops you can pull from."""

977,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 05:03PM ET</span>","U.S. charges ex-CEO, ex-CFO of Brixmor Property Group REIT with fraud","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer of  Brixmor Property  Group Inc (N:BRX) were charged on Thursday with accounting fraud for manipulating a key financial metric for the large shopping center owner and operator.
The fraud and conspiracy charges against former CEO Michael Carroll and former CFO Michael Pappagallo follow guilty pleas to those charges last month by two other former Brixmor officials, chief accounting officer Steven Splain and senior vice president of accounting Michael Mortimer.
Brixmor, a New York-based real estate investment trust with about 421 shopping centers, said it will pay a $7 million fine and hire an independent consultant for its financial reporting to settle a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit, without admitting wrongdoing.
The SEC also filed civil charges against the four individual defendants, all of whom resigned from Brixmor in February 2016.
Lawyers for those defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Investigators began examining Brixmor in February 2016 after the REIT said it had uncovered ""smoothing"" in same property net operating income (""SP-NOI""), a key measure for investors of a REIT's financial performance.
Brixmor's share price fell 20.1 percent, wiping out about $1.6 billion of market value, on the first trading day after the disclosure, according to Reuters data.
Prosecutors said Carroll and Pappagallo falsely touted the consistency of Brixmor's SP-NOI growth rate, with Carroll even describing it at an industry conference as the REIT's ""secret sauce,"" when in fact the rate fluctuated significantly.
The defendants concealed the volatility through a variety of means, including by squirreling away extra income for future use in so-called ""cookie jar"" accounting, prosecutors said.
According to the indictment, Pappagallo once expressed concern after a Brixmor investor relations employee questioned one of the suspect accounting tactics.
""How did she find out?"" the indictment quoted him as saying. ""She must not be given access to how we make the sausage.""
Carroll, 51, of Manhattan, and Pappagallo, 60, of Trumbull, Connecticut, each faces six criminal charges, five of which carry maximum 20-year prison terms.

LONDON (Reuters) - The reactivation of a smelter belonging to Chile's state-run Codelco, the world's top copper producer, will be further delayed until the end of October this year after missing a previous target of April, four sources told Reuters.
Codelco is also buying copper cathode on the spot market, the sources added.
One of the sources said the purchases were part of efforts to build up its in-house trading unit while two other sources said the copper producer was short of metal.
Codelco was not immediately available to comment. 
The Chuquicamata smelter is one of the world's largest, producing 320,000 tonnes of metal in 2018, and was originally halted in December last year for changes to meet new emissions standards.
More broadly Chuquicamata, or ""Chuqui,"" one of Codelco's key copper deposits, is undergoing a complex $5 billion-plus transformation into an underground shaft mine from an open pit facility to counter deteriorating ore grades. 
The 24-million-tonne copper market is expected to see a deficit of 189,000 tonnes this year which will widen to 250,000 tonnes in 2020, according to the International Copper Study Group.
Prices of the metal used widely in the power and construction industries are trading around $5,880 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange.
Smelters are charging miners less to refine concentrates into metal due to falling availability of mine supply, reflected in declining treatment and refining charges.
Treatment charges in China, the world's top consumer of copper, are around $60 a tonne, their lowest since Nov. 2012.
The smelter delay will also affect the output of molybdenum, a byproduct of copper smelting and used to make stainless steel, where Codelco is the world's second largest producer in the 265,000-tonne market.
As part of efforts to modernize state-owned Codelco, about 200 employees lost their jobs at the company in July, according to a source.
Codelco appointed company veteran Octavio Araneda as the new chief executive last month as it pushed forward with a 10 year, $40 billion plan to overhaul its flagship mines against a backdrop of falling ore grades and wavering markets. 

Reuters reported in May that the Chuquicamata mine will see a 40% drop in production over the next two years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street fell again on Thursday, abruptly reversing early gains after U.S. President Donald Trump put concerns about the U.S.-China trade war back in the spotlight, tweeting that he would impose an additional 10% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese imports.
Having spent most of the session on track for their best day since June, all three major U.S. stock indices took sudden U-turns as investors quickly turned into sellers after the tweet.
The bond market rallied on Trump's comment, prompting U.S. Treasury yields into their steepest drop in over a year. The benchmark 10-year yield fell to its lowest level since November 2016.
The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, shot to its highest reading since June 4.
""The biggest issue for investors to realize is that this is systemic and is going to be an ongoing issue between the U.S. and China,"" said Joseph Quinlan, head of chief investment office market strategy for Merrill and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Private Bank in New York.
""The markets don't like uncertainty and this is a bolt from the blue in terms of uncertainty.""
The sell-off comes on the heels of the U.S. Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut in a decade, and remarks from Fed chief Jerome Powell that tempered expectations for further cuts this year, cuts Trump has been vocal about supporting.
""It looks like the president is bullying the chairman of the Federal Reserve in order to wage his trade war,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""The market should not appreciate that.""
Earlier in the session, Wall Street got a boost from a string of positive earnings from a wide range of companies, including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Kellogg Co,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and Yum Brands Inc, among others.
In economic news, the U.S. manufacturing sector expanded in July at its slowest pace in almost three years, according to the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing manager index (PMI).
Investors now look to Friday's release of the Labor Department's closely-watched jobs report.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 280.85 points, or 1.05%, to 26,583.42, the S&P 500 lost 26.82 points, or 0.90%, to 2,953.56 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 64.30 points, or 0.79%, to 8,111.12.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, eight closed in negative territory, with financials, energy and trade-sensitive industrials seeing the biggest percentage losses.
Second-quarter earnings season continues at full throttle, with 355 of S&P 500 companies having reported. Of those, 74.4% have bested Street estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
Analysts now see S&P 500 earnings growth of 2.5%, up from just 0.3% a month ago, per Refinitiv.
Pick-up trucks and SUVs drove General Motors' second-quarter profit beat, but the automaker's stock turned negative after the Trump tweet, ending the session down 0.5%.
Kellogg surged 9.3% as higher North American demand helped the packaged food company beat second-quarter estimates.
Shares of Yum Brands Inc jumped 3.9% after beating analyst profit and sales expectations on better-than-expected growth at all its restaurant chains, which include Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 136 new lows.

981,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>",Treasury Yields Dive to Lowest Since 2016 as Trade War Escalates,"(Bloomberg) -- Ten-year Treasury yields plunged to the lowest since 2016 as U.S. President Donald Trump said he would slap a 10% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese imports, and as traders slashed their inflation outlook.
The prospect of escalating trade tension between the U.S. and China added to investors’ doubts that the Federal Reserve’s quarter-point rate cut and forward guidance Wednesday would be sufficient to bolster inflation pressures. Futures show traders now expect more than 50 basis points of additional Fed easing this year.
The tariff developments took on added meaning, coming the day after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cited trade tensions, weakening global growth and too low inflation and as justification for Wednesday’s decision. Helping fuel the bond rally, a report showing U.S. manufacturing activity deteriorating also dimmed the growth picture.
“It means the first of Powell’s three items just went from simmer to boil,” said John Briggs, head of strategy for the Americas at NatWest. “He probably regrets not leaving the door more open to future cuts ‘if necessary.’”
The 10-year Treasury yield dropped as much as 14 basis points to 1.88%, the lowest since November 2016. The 10-year breakeven rate -- which reflects ’ expectations for annual gains in consumer prices -- fell as low as 1.69%, from Wednesday’s high of 1.79%. It hasn’t been above 2% -- the Fed’s inflation target -- since late last year.
“The Fed cited breakeven inflation rates as one of their core justifications for cutting rates in the first place,” said Jon Hill, a rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets “It’s hard for the 10-year yield to stay above 2% in a world where inflation expectations are falling pretty fast.”
Interest-rate volatility rose amid the plunge in Treasury yields. The benchmark gauge of three-month options on 10-year interest-rate swaps rose 1.5 basis points to 58.7 basis points."
982,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 04:29PM ET</span>",Stock Traders Have Theories About Timing of Trump's Tariff Tweet,"(Bloomberg) -- A day after posting its first 1% loss in two months, the S&P 500 posted its first 1% reversal of the year, with Thursday’s recovery from Jerome Powell’s press conference torpedoed by a Donald Trump tariff tweet.
To recap: stocks plunged Wednesday as Powell described the Federal Reserve’s rate cut as a “mid-cycle adjustment,” which traders interpreted as signaling fewer reductions. After bouncing back, equities tumbled anew when Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese imports that aren’t yet subject to levies. Dutifully, traders of fed funds futures boosted the amount of easing they expect from the Fed this year after the tweet hit.
Some equity players doubt it’s coincidental. By their logic, after the Fed chairman said his rate cut was justified by trade tensions, it makes sense the president would be tempted to create more of them.
Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management“The timing is certainly interesting and leads one to wonder whether the President would still be announcing the additional tariff now had yesterday’s FOMC press conference gone differently.”
Ed Moya, chief market strategist at Oanda Corp.“It is providing a little bit of fuel to his fire in the timing of this escalation. I don’t think anyone is surprised that we’d see a new tariff threat but not even 24 hours after this rate decision, we saw this come out. He wants to see the Fed deliver an easing cycle not a mid-cycle adjustment. The Fed has been very clear that there are a few things would make them deliver rate cuts and a fallout of trade talks with China is going to be very damaging for economic growth and that would warrant the beginning of an easing cycle.”
Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp.“That’s the real problem. In large part, nobody on the Fed believes tariffs are good economic policy. But they also know that becoming easier on monetary policy, they were going to embolden trade policy. They didn’t have to wait 24 hours to see the results.”
“Unfortunately, as we’ve seen with all these other tariffs, they start at 10% and they don’t stop there. And it probably doesn’t help us negotiate. This is like going from a frying pan into the fire.”
Yousef Abbasi, director of U.S. institutional equities and global market strategist at INTL FCStone.“Being the devil’s advocate: what difference does it make? Tariffs will hurt the global economy and the Fed, ECB, BoJ, BoE will all step in to keep money easy and stimulate. So while it certainly is annoying -- and this move could see China walk away or express displeasure with retaliatory tariffs -- but if/when that happens, the market seems to go to ‘old reliable,’ it’s the belief that central banks will step in and print to help keep us from recession.”"

In a press conference alongside his environment and foreign affairs ministers, Bolsonaro said that the “sensationalist” figures showing an 88% expansion in Amazon deforestation between June 2018 and June 2019 jeopardized Brazil’s foreign relations. The president blamed the numbers on a biased political operatives and threaten to fire anyone who had been found to manipulate the data to make his administration look bad.
“We suffer all kinds of attacks, and Brazil’s image, and my personal image, is terrible abroad due to the labels placed on me,” Bolsonaro said. “These labels have to be dismissed step by step by using the truth. Everything regarding the environment has a huge foreign repercussion.”
Environment Minister Ricardo Salles presented technical explanations to dismiss the deforestation data. He said that the June numbers had included some data from previous months and that some areas had been counted twice.
Salles added that Brazil would update its technological tools to account for deforestation and conceded that the country needs to improve oversight to preserve the Amazon. He also said he is seeking to incorporate the people living in the rain forest into the economy, allowing for both its exploration and its preservation."
984,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 03:33PM ET</span>","'Truck, truck and away': Pickups drive GM's profit beat","By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) posted a better-than-expected net profit on Thursday as high-margin pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers helped overcome slowing sales in the United States and China, and reiterated its full-year earnings forecast.
GM shares gained 3.3% to over a one-year high.
Virtually all of the No. 1 U.S. automaker's profit came from North America, where it posted a profit margin of 10.7% and profits came in $400 million ahead of analysts' expectations.
Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally, in a research note entitled, ""Truck, truck and away...,"" said the rest of the year and 2020 could be the company's ""time to shine.""
""The alarm clock may be softly ringing for GM to finally reawaken from its trading range slumber,"" he said of the stock.
GM executives said things will get even better as the rollout of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks continues, including the introduction of diesel-powered and heavy-duty pickups this year and large SUVs early in 2020.
""We delivered a solid quarter as we begin to demonstrate the earnings power of our full-size truck business,"" Chief Executive Mary Barra said on a call with analysts.
GM is open to working with other automakers on the development of electric vehicles, Barra also said.
GM's strong showing came despite slumping industry demand in China, the world's largest auto market.
Other automakers, including U.S. rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), offered disappointing forecasts last week.
GM also faces an escalating price war in the lucrative U.S. pickup truck segment for its newly-revamped Chevrolet Silverado. Nevertheless, GM was able to add $1 billion in profits in the quarter in North America thanks to stronger pricing and higher sales of more lucrative vehicles.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) has been battling for market share with its all-new Ram pickup and outsold the Silverado in the second quarter.
FCA took the market by surprise on Wednesday by sticking to its full-year profit guidance after a strong performance from its Ram pickup truck in North America helped it defy the industry slowdown.
GM's overall U.S. sales fell 1.5% in the second quarter.
In the second quarter, GM's China sales slid 12%, a slight improvement over the 17.5% decline in the first quarter.
GM said industry-wide sales in China should remain weak for the rest of the year, but added that its vehicle lineup in that market will be boosted by the addition of new SUVs.
GM's equity income from its Chinese operations fell to $235 million from $592 million a year earlier. The automaker said Chinese equity income in the second half of the year should roughly match the $611 million it posted for the first half.
The company said it still expects full-year 2019 earnings per share in a range from $6.50 to $7. Analysts are expecting $6.62 a share.
The automaker also said it still expects full-year adjusted automotive free cash flow in a range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion, meaning it would need to generate between $5.9 billion and $7.4 billion in the second half of the year. Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said in a research note that hitting the cash flow target ""still looks challenging.""
GM's capital spending in the second quarter fell $700 million from last year to $1.4 billion.
GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara said the carmaker still expects capital spending for the year of $8 billion to $9 billion. She added that the impact of tariffs and commodity costs this year will be half the $1 billion the company forecast in January.
GM has achieved $1.1 billion in savings so far this year related to the restructuring that included plans to cut 15,000 jobs and end production at five North American plants, Suryadevara said. GM previously forecast savings in 2019 in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
The plan came under withering criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and members of Congress.
GM reported second-quarter net income of $2.41 billion or $1.66 per share, compared with $2.39 billion or $1.66 per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, GM reported earnings of $1.64 per share.
Analysts had on average expected earnings per share of $1.44, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
GM reported second-quarter revenue of $36.1 billion, above analysts' estimates of $35.98 billion."

994,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 01:42PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brazil's Petrobras studies downsizing logistics unit,"By Gram Slattery
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petrobras is studying a mass transfer of employees out of its Transpetro logistics unit, according to a document seen by Reuters, in a sign the company may be gearing up to privatize additional assets.
The human resources departments of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, and Transpetro are developing an ""action plan for the evaluation and possible return of (employees) ceded to Transpetro from the parent company,"" according to the document, dated July 24.
It is common at Petrobras for employees to be hired by the parent company and later transferred to a subsidiary. Such workers technically remain employed by the parent company, and are transferred back to Petrobras if a unit is privatized.
A similar process occurred at fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA, according to two sources familiar with the matter, before it was privatized via share offering this month.
Transpetro had 6,435 employees at the end of 2016, 1,090 of whom had been ""ceded"" to the company by Petrobras, according to the company.
""After individual evaluations, human resources will consolidate the information and, together with executive managers, come up with a return plan for employees,"" reads the internal Petrobras document about workers ceded to Transpetro.
Asked about the plans, Petrobras said in a statement it is ""constantly carrying out evaluations of the profile and quantity of its personnel, taking into account goals, competencies and knowledge.""
Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who took the reins in January, is working to sell midstream and downstream assets in a bid to reduce debt and sharpen the focus on offshore oil exploration and production.
In April, Petrobras agreed to sell a collection of gas pipelines to France's Engie SA for $8.6 billion. The firm is also looking to sell eight refineries in a process Castello Branco said could fetch $15 billion.
While the refineries are not part of the Transpetro unit, formally known as Petrobras Transporte SA, Petrobras will be selling a number of associated pipelines and terminals, which are part of Transpetro.
Transpetro operates over 7,500 km (4,660 miles) of oil pipelines, according to its website, and has a fleet of over 50 ships, among other assets. It reported net revenue of 10.4 billion reais ($1.8 billion) in 2018, contributing about 2% of the parent company's revenue."

The move by Bezos was part of a previously adopted trading plan and was revealed in regulatory filings that also showed that his former wife Mackenzie Bezos is now the online retailer's second largest individual shareholder.
Her stake, stemming from a divorce settlement of the pair's previous joint holdings, is currently worth more than $37 billion.
The numbers mean Bezos retains his pole position among the world's billionaires, while his former wife now ranks 23rd, according to Forbes data. 
The couple announced their plan to divorce in a joint Twitter statement in January, and Amazon disclosed in April that 4% of its outstanding stock or 19.7 million shares would be registered in MacKenzie Bezos' name after court approval of the divorce.
The billionaire chief executive has said previously that he would sell stock worth about $1 billion each year to fund his rocket company, Blue Origin.

Blue Origin aims eventually to cut the cost of space flight to levels that would allow millions of people to live and work off Earth, Bezos has said.

1002,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 12:37PM ET</span>","Kellogg results beat forecasts on North America demand, shares surge","(Reuters) - Kellogg Co (N:K) beat Wall Street expectations for quarterly sales and profit on Thursday, and the food maker's shares rose sharply as investments in marketing and product development drove higher demand for snacks, frozen waffles and meatless burgers in North America.
Kellogg makes Pringles, Pop-Tarts, Eggo Waffles and a wide range of breakfast cereals including Corn Flakes. The Battle Creek, Michigan-based company has been spending more on advertising and developing new products to suit changing consumer preferences for healthier food, premium products and smaller portions.
""We're literally selling every Eggo that we can make, we have new capacity coming online,"" Chief Executive Officer Steve Cahillane told Reuters, attributing the brand's growth to the launch of high-protein waffles and frozen french toast. A marketing tie-up between Eggo and Netflix's (O:NFLX) Stranger Things is expected to help further boost sales, he said. 
""We love the show, we think it's helped Eggo resonate.""
Net sales from North America, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Kellogg's revenue, rose 1% in the second quarter ended June 29. The North America unit has not grown sales by this much since the first quarter of 2013, according to J.P.Morgan analyst Ken Goldman.
Kellogg's Morningstar brand, which makes plant-based nuggets and burgers, also drove sales, Cahillane said. Plant-based meat alternatives have enjoyed booming sales as Americans have grown more worried about health risks from eating meat, animal welfare and the environmental hazards of intensive animal farming.
Shares were up 9.5% in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange at 63.75, paring earlier gains of 12%.
The company's 2018 acquisition of a 50 percent stake in Multipro - a sales and distribution company in Nigeria and Ghana - helped drive a 23 percent jump in sales from the company's Asia, Middle East and Africa unit.
Total net sales increased 3% to $3.46 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.41 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. On an organic basis, excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange impact, sales rose 2.3%. 
Excluding items, the company earned 99 cents per share, beating expectations of 92 cents. 
Net income attributable to the company tumbled 52% to $286 million due to restructuring and divestment costs and a lower tax rate in the prior-year period. Kellogg sold Keebler biscuits and a handful of other brands for $1.3 billion in April, and announced plans in May and June to revamp its European and North American operations. 

Earnings were pressured by higher input costs and a strong dollar, Kellogg said. Consumer goods companies have struggled for over two years with a surge in commodities prices and transportation expenses.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 12:14PM ET</span>",Verizon beats profit estimates as monthly phone subscribers jump,"By Angela Moon and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) on Thursday beat second-quarter profit estimates as the U.S. mobile carrier added more monthly phone subscribers than expected and stepped up efforts to deploy the next-generation 5G network nationwide. 
Shares of the Dow component were up 1.3% at $56.00 at midday after the company said it added a net 245,000 phone subscribers during the quarter. Analysts were expecting it to add 163,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.
Analysts pay attention to postpaid customers, or those with a recurring bill, because they are more valuable to carriers and tend to remain with the company longer than prepaid customers.
""Verizon made history this quarter by becoming the first carrier in the world to launch 5G mobility,"" said Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg. ""We are focused on optimizing our next-generation networks and enhancing the customer experience while we head into the second half of the year with great momentum."" 
The company's progress with 5G technology, he added, was going ""extremely faster"" than it had with 4G.
Verizon has focused on deploying 5G nationwide, seeking to expand to more than 30 U.S. cities in 2019. Earlier this week, Verizon started servicing parts of Washington, Atlanta, Detroit and Indianapolis with 5G. 
But while Verizon is leading the charge to test its 5G services, industry analysts say the higher-speed networks are unlikely to be widely available until the middle of the next decade. 
The earnings announcement came about a week after the U.S. Justice Department approved a merger between T-Mobile USA and Sprint Corp. As part of that approval, T-Mobile agreed to divest Sprint's prepaid businesses including Boost Mobile and other assets to Dish Network Corp to build out a viable fourth carrier in a couple of years.
Verizon, AT&T (NYSE:T), T-Mobile and Sprint control more than 98% of the U.S. wireless market and have wireless service revenues of more than $160 billion. T-Mobile and Sprint together have more than 135 million customers, while Verizon and AT&T control two-thirds of the total U.S. wireless market.
Net income attributable to Verizon fell to $3.94 billion or 95 cents per share in the quarter ended June 30, from $4.12 billion or $1 per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, Verizon earned $1.23 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.20 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Total operating revenue fell 0.4% to $32.1 billion, missing expectations of $32.41 billion. Revenue from Verizon's media unit alone was $1.8 billion, down 2.9% from a year earlier.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>",LSE's $27 billion deal rehabilitates Refinitiv debt,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial data firm Refinitiv's $13.5 billion debt, once described as having some of the weakest-ever investor protections typical of the frothy peak of the credit cycle, is being rehabilitated by its $27 billion merger with the London Stock Exchange.
Prices of Refinitiv's (RFT.UL) bonds hit all-time highs Thursday after the LSE formally announced the acquisition and said Refinitiv's debt would be refinanced by a bridge loan of the same size. The combination with the investment-grade LSE would boost the credit profile of Refinitiv, which currently holds a speculative-grade rating.
Thursday's announcement comes less than a year after Refinitiv's bonds went to market with significant interest expenses and weak investor protections, issued to fund the carve-out of the Refinitiv business from Thomson Reuters, sold to private-equity giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) for $20 billion. 
Thomson Reuters is the parent company of Reuters News. 
The buyout had left Refinitiv with debt of more than five time earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, contingent on optimistic cost cuts. 
Credit research firm Covenant Review decried the Refinitiv bonds as having some of the weakest investor protections since the global financial crisis a decade ago.
Covenants on two of the four bonds issued, which typically limit a company's ability to borrow in order to protect credit investors, were given the worst possible rating by Moody's Investors Service. The other two were ranked in the weakest category not far off. The debtload hampered Refinitiv's capacity for growth.
""The initial transaction, the way it was put forth to investors, was definitely missing a story on the growth side,"" said Gregory Fraser, senior credit analyst at Moody's. 
Growth would have had to come from investing in the business or merging, both of which would require more cash than could easily be come by with $13.5 billion debt to service. 
""It is definitely a credit positive for Refinitiv,"" said Fraser. ""They would be able to refinance the debt at LSE's more attractive rates and save that interest expense to reinvest in the business.""
The deal, and subsequent jump in bond prices, has rewarded investors who made a high-risk bet in the hunt for yield. The biggest price gain has been a nearly 11% rise since July 25, when news of the deal was first reported by the Financial Times, in the 6.875% November 2026 note worth 365 million euro. The dollar-denominated 8.25% November 2026 junk bond worth $1.575 billion was last up 6% to trade at 110.75 cents on the dollar. 
In the months after the Blackstone buyout, Refinitiv debt traded below par, bottoming out in January. Since then, prices have risen but, prior to the report of deal talks, have largely underperformed the comparable Merrill Lynch indexes, said Marty Fridson, chief investment officer at Lehmann, Livian, Fridson. 
On an option-adjusted basis, the spread over government bonds - a measure of the premium investors are paid to hold the riskier securities - narrowed by 61.3 basis points for the 4.5% May 2026 eurobond versus 159 basis points for the Merrill Lynch European currency high yield BB-B rated index for the year through July 25.
The 6.25% May 2026 dollar-denominated issue underperformed the comparable Merrill Lynch index by 22.9 basis points and the November 2026 6.875% eurobond was 20.1 basis points lower than the comparable index for its B+ Standard & Poor's rating, and 4.1 basis points lower than the index for its Caa2 Moody's rating. Only the 8.25% November 2026 dollar-denominated bond outperformed. 

""There's no real support for the thesis that Refinitiv was a darling of investors or outperformed the market prior to the big rise that occurred when word of the impending LSE purchase began to leak out,"" Fridson said. ""The impact of the LSE announcement was so great that it swamped any lingering concern about the covenants.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The apparent suicide of India's coffee baron V.G. Siddhartha, under investigation by tax authorities, has inflamed anger toward the government among business leaders who feel it is going too far in its crackdown on fraud and tax evasion.
Drastic measures taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration include stringent action to enforce tax compliance, probes into bank lending practices and threatening auditors with five-year bans for alleged lapses in their work.
In particular the push by tax collectors has been labeled 'tax terrorism' by T.V. Mohandas Pai, a former director of Indian IT giant  Infosys  Ltd (NS:INFY), even before the  Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd  (NS:CODE) founder disappeared and his body was later found floating in a river in southern India on Wednesday. 
In a letter circulating on social media since Tuesday and purportedly written by Siddhartha to the firm's board and employees, he said he ""gave up"", blaming tax authorities for ""harassment"" and decisions that caused a liquidity crunch as well as an unnamed private equity partner for pressuring him into a share buyback.
The letter's authenticity has not been verified and much remains unclear about his financial situation and apparent suicide. But the company's board said it is taking the letter's content seriously and will thoroughly investigate.
India's income tax department, part of the finance ministry, has said it acted as per the law in its investigation of Siddhartha and the coffee chain, and its probe was based on credible evidence of transactions done in a concealed manner.
Former government officials, industry executives and their advisors, including lawyers, told Reuters that investigations conducted by Indian agencies and tax inspectors had often resulted in harassment for business leaders.
Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, managing director of biotech firm  Biocon  Ltd (NS:BION), said she knew many industrialists who have been called in by Indian enforcement agencies but were made to wait for long periods before questioning began and subjected to ""insulting kind of treatment.""
""People are made to wait for 24 hours, 12 hours, 16 hours. This is not some kind of inquisition. It cannot be treated like an inquisition,"" she said. ""Today every business person is made out to be as if there is something very crooked about them.""
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her reply to a question in parliament late on Thursday said failing businessmen should either be provided with an honorable exit or a resolution. ""Business failure in this country should not be taboo,"" she said.
PRESSURE TO COLLECT
Since Modi came to power in 2014, he has made fighting fraud and tax evasion a top goal, saying he wanted to break previous cozy ties between policymakers and rich capitalists. 
His administration has targeted banks and heavily indebted businesses and tracked down rich fugitives hiding out in other countries - popular policies that helped him win a second-term in a landslide election victory in May.
While many government officials and business leaders agree that regulations need to be more strictly enforced, they also say the government has been overzealous, making business leaders too fearful to invest and endangering the health of the economy.
In particular, they are concerned that enforcement agencies increasingly go after loan defaulters without differentiating between genuine business failures and corrupt practices.
""Any enforcement agency first looks at you as a crook,"" said J.N. Gupta, a former executive director at India's capital markets regulator, adding that the loss of Siddhartha's life was a very sad moment but one that was giving India an opportunity to find out what had gone wrong with the system.
""We have a very thin line between duty and harassment. The enforcement agencies fail to realize that sometimes their zeal could be seen as harassment.""
Tax collectors are also under pressure, government sources familiar with the matter have said, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to speak on the matter.
With economic growth at a five-year low and keen to fund more public spending, the government has set an income tax target of 13.35 trillion rupees ($193 billion) for this fiscal year, some 15% higher than last year. 
The general distrust of businesses is very high in the bureaucracy, said Pratibha Jain, a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates which advises corporate clients on tax and investigation matters.

""Tax authorities are keeping focus only on corporations and individuals to meet their revenue base, rather than looking at it in a fair manner which requires widening the tax base to get tax evaders to pay up,"" she said.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 10:33AM ET</span>",ADM adjusted profit falls 41.3%,"By P.J. Huffstutter
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Global grain trader and food processor Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM) on Thursday reported a 41.3% drop in second-quarter adjusted profit and missed Wall Street expectations, after being battered by the U.S.-China trade war and severe U.S. weather this spring that disrupted production and transportation.
The Chicago-based company's performance so far this year represents a sharp reversal of fortunes from last year, when ADM's profits surged after a drought in Argentina and the U.S.-China trade dispute boosted its trading and oilseed processing businesses.
For the second quarter ended June 30, its adjusted net earnings for the quarter fell to $340 million, or 60 cents per share, from $579 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 4.5% to $16.3 billion.
ADM had been expected to earn 61 cents per share, according to the mean Refinitiv estimate from 11 analysts.
The biggest drop was in the company's origination business, which reported a 63% fall in adjusted operating profit. ADM blamed this on heavy rains that halted barge traffic on the Mississippi River and shuttered some of its plants. 
The trade war also caused problems, as corn and other U.S. crops struggled to compete for sales in export markets.
ADM executives had been banking on the dispute to have eased by the second quarter and had based a rebound of the company's operating performance in the second half on broad grain purchases from China this summer. Such big purchases have not materialized.
The company remains confident in U.S.-China trade resuming, but Chief Executive Juan Luciano acknowledged on Thursday ""the timing is uncertain.""
The trade fight is part of why ADM has been expanding into Europe, Brazil and South America, Luciano said on an analysts call on Thursday. 
WEATHER WOES
Beyond the trade war, heavy rains and flooding battered ADM during the quarter with ""unfavorable weather impacts"" of about $65 million to its operating profits. Such extreme weather cost ADM $125 million in lost production for the first half of the year, Luciano said.
ADM and  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG), as well as peers Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and Louis Dreyfus Co [LOUDR.UL], known as the ABCDs of global grain trading giants, all have wrestled with weather issues this year.
But ADM was particularly vulnerable to the flooding, analysts say, because unlike its rivals, the concentration of its assets are in the United States.
The company said it faced processing plant downtime and barge shipping delays this spring as historic floods ravaged the central United States.
High water conditions were more severe than originally anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, ADM said in its earning statement, ""causing a negative impact of approximately $40 million.""
Meanwhile, its oilseeds' business North American crush volumes dropped and flooding caused production outages at its Quincy, Illinois, facility, ""which had a negative impact of approximately $10 million,"" the company said.
ADM South American crushing and origination margins also were down because of higher soybean prices and lower China demand during the quarter.
Severe weather issues affected ADM's carbohydrate solutions business and reduced segment results by $15 million, in part because of flood-related issues at its Columbus, Nebraska, facility, the company said.
The company, which has been pushing to cut its workforce and streamline operations to curb costs, said on Thursday the results also include non-cash early retirement charges and global workforce restructuring charges of $101 million. 
In April, ADM said it was seeking voluntary early retirements by some North American employees and may eliminate individual jobs as part of a restructuring effort.
CHINA AND ASF
The company also pointed out that it is starting to spot economic ripple effects from the outbreak of African swine fever, a fatal hog disease that has killed millions of pigs in China.
As China has increased its imports of poultry and pork, ADM said it has seen meat companies upgrade their production facilities to prepare for increased demand from China, Luciano said on the analysts. 
ADM said that it thinks China has lost about 35% of its hog herd and will continue to see a drop in pork production into next year, Luciano said. That will eventually boost demand for soymeal feedstuffs in South America, Europe, the United States and elsewhere, Luciano said. 

""This will be a large multiyear event for our industry, and we continue to believe it will support incremental demand for the global crush industry outside China,"" Luciano said.

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 10:32AM ET</span>",London Stock Exchange agrees to buy Refinitiv in $27 billion deal,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - London Stock Exchange has agreed to buy financial information provider Refinitiv in a $27 billion deal aimed at offering trading across regions and currencies and establishing the British company as a rival to Bloomberg.
The deal, which was confirmed on Thursday and is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, will expand LSE's trading business beyond shares and derivatives into currencies and make it a major distributor as well as creator of market data.
""This transaction is a defining moment for LSE in terms of its strategic importance,"" LSE Chairman Don Robert said of the purchase, which comes ten months after a consortium led by U.S. private equity group Blackstone (NYSE:BX) completed a leveraged buyout of Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters.
""Increasingly our customers want to trade across different regions and currencies,"" LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer told journalists of the rationale for the move.
Shareholders welcomed confirmation of the deal, which was initially revealed last week, and LSE's stock rose more than 7.9% to a record high of 7,152 pence after its first-half total income rose 8% rise to 1.1 billion pounds ($1.33 billion).
The sale of Refinitiv marks a rapid turnaround for Blackstone, which a person familiar with the deal said would double the value of its investment. 
Ultimately Refinitiv shareholders will own a stake of around 37% in LSE but have less than 30% of total voting rights. LSE will issue around $14.5 billion of new shares to fund the deal and take on Refinitiv's net debt of $12.5 billion.
Robert will chair the enlarged company and Schwimmer will be CEO, while Refinitiv CEO David Craig will join LSE's executive committee and continue to run that business.
The deal's origins date back to 2013 when Craig - then running Thomson Reuters' Financial and Risk division - was introduced to Blackstone's head of private equity Joseph Baratta at the Chelsea Flower Show, three sources told Reuters.
(GRAPHIC - Britain's LSE seals $27 bln Refinitiv deal to create data giant: https://tmsnrt.rs/2yqyIdX)
'RARE AND COMPELLING' 
EU competition regulators blocked LSE's attempt to merge with rival Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), the exchanges' fifth attempt to combine, in 2017 and sources close to the Refinitiv deal expect full competition investigations, which could take a year to 18 months.. 
But LSE executives said they were confident the ""rare and compelling"" deal would make it past the regulators. 
""We have two very complementary businesses, they are more complementary than they are overlapping,"" Schwimmer said.
Asset managers have told regulators that exchanges are charging too much for data on share prices and LSE stressed that it would retain its commitment to ""open access"" after the deal.
""The issue is largely a U.S. issue in terms of concern around market data pricing,"" Schwimmer said, adding that LSE had no plans for any divestments.
While Schwimmer said it was too early to comment on possible job losses, LSE Chief Financial Officer David Warren said the areas where there were overlaps that could yield cost savings include property, technology and corporate services.
LSE expects the deal to complete by the second half of 2020 and will pay Refinitiv a break fee of 198.3 million pounds if the merger is blocked by regulators. 
(GRAPHIC - LSE's spend on acquisitions in the decade: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ymw7lg)
BREXIT SCENARIOS
The deal comes amid uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union and Blackstone and Thomson Reuters run the risk that LSE shares could fall if Britain leaves without a deal. 
New Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the bloc by October 31 with or without a deal, sending the pound to is lowest level in more than two years.
LSE has already reorganized some of its EU-exposed businesses, opening an Amsterdam hub for its Pan-European stock platform Turquoise, and shifted European government bond trading to the Milan arm of its MTS platform.
""We are prepared for whatever may come from the various Brexit scenarios,"" Schwimmer said, adding that a ""global footprint"" was driving the deal rather than Brexit.

NEWS DEAL 
Blackstone's consortium, which includes Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Special Investments Pte Ltd, holds a 55% stake in Refinitiv.
Thomson Reuters, which owns the remainder and is the parent company of Reuters, will hold 15% of LSE, it said in a separate statement.
The Canadian company added that the agreement signed at the time Refinitiv was sold to the Blackstone-consortium for Reuters to supply news to Refinitiv for 30 years would remain in place.
Advisers for LSE include CEO Schwimmer's former employer Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Robey Warshaw, and its corporate broker  Barclays  (LON:BARC) while Refinitiv was advised by Evercore, Canson Capital and Jefferies.
Thomson Reuters was advised by Guggenheim Securities.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - By taking back full control of Kenya Airways (NR:KQNA), lawmakers are banking on Kenya's ability to replicate the profitable example of Ethiopia's state-owned flag carrier Ethiopian Airlines.
The global precedents are not reassuring.
Government takeovers rarely transform loss-making airlines, analysts say. And Kenya Airways faces two major hurdles: competition from regional rivals and potential government interference.
Parliament voted last week to renationalize the loss-making airline, which is laboring under a mountain of debt and has had three changes of chief executive in the past five years as it struggles to compete with regional rivals.
Kenya plans to form an aviation holding company with a healthier balance sheet by combining the airline with a planned national aviation college and profit-making assets such as the main international airport and airports authority.
But some experts believe such a move may only compound the airline's problems, opening it up to political interference without a clear strategic direction - although the government says it will allow the airline to be run like a private company.
""The future risk is government micro-management of the airline, which never works,"" said airline consultant Nick Fadugba, chief executive of African Aviation Services, an organization that promotes development of the sector in Africa.
The Kenyan carrier, which is 48.9% government-owned and 7.8% held by Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), was once held up as a model of successful privatization.
It sank into losses in 2014 after making costly aircraft purchases, which coincided with a slump in tourist and business travel to Kenya blamed on a spate of attacks by Somalia-based Islamist militants.
""They didn't really expand with sufficient capital; that really put them into a bit of trouble,"" said Eric Musau, head of research at Standard Investment Bank in Nairobi.
LONG-TERM STRATEGY
Debt restructuring narrowed its pretax losses for last year to 7.59 billion shillings from 9.44 billion, but did not pull the company back into the black.
The airline's frequent change of CEO has hobbled its ability to form a long-term strategy. In May, current boss Sebastian Mikosz said he would leave at the end of the year, citing personal reasons.
Kenyan Airways is operating in a tough market. The International Air Transport Association projects African airlines will post a combined $100 million loss in 2019, even as the global industry generates a profit of $28 billion.
""The Kenyan government has sort of run out of options,"" said Phil Seymour, chief executive of IBA Group, a Surrey-based aviation consultancy. ""Kenya Airways' fortunes have declined both on business traffic and tourists.""
Renationalization, Seymour said, is a ""last resort type of move"".
The airline faces stiff competition, not just from major players like Emirates and Turkish Airlines (IS:THYAO). Both Uganda and Tanzania have poured cash into their flag carriers in the past three years, joining countries such as Rwanda and Togo which have also ramped up investment.
Ethiopian Airlines is the biggest regional threat. Sub-Saharan Africa's only major profitable state-owned airline has been snapping up stakes in smaller carriers around the continent in a bid to become the dominant pan-African airline.
It now flies to more than 120 destinations, compared with Kenya Airways' 56. It has grown about 25% a year since 2010 and made a net $233 million in the 2017-18 fiscal year.
""It's not who owns the airline that determines the success or failure of an African airline. It's how they are run,"" said Zemedeneh Negatu, chairman of the U.S.-based investment firm Fairfax, which focuses on Africa.
The Kenyan carrier will need to decide whether to focus its strategy on growth within Africa or on long-haul routes, analysts said.
Zemedeneh, whose firm has advised Uganda and Rwanda on their national carriers, said Kenya Airways should partner with its Ethiopian rival to take on big international carriers that control at least 80% of traffic in and out of the continent.
One of Kenya's main competitors on these routes is Dutch carrier KLM, which is also an equity partner, Fadugba said. What that relationship will look like in future remains to be seen.
""We’ll have to see what happens and what form the nationalization takes. We don’t exactly know yet whether it will happen through a new share issue or a more direct operation,"" Air France-KLM Finance Director Frederic Gagey said.
""As far as Air France-KLM is concerned, we continue to consider Kenya Airways as an important partner, particularly on those routes between the group’s two hubs and East Africa,"" Gagey added.
HUGE LOSSES
Renationalizing a failing airline has had mixed results depending in part on the level of government interference.
""Over the last 20 to 25 years, for most national airlines the move has been to privatization and not nationalization,"" Seymour said. ""Governments are moving away from nationalization, as national airlines tend to be inefficient.""
Before Kenyan Airways was privatized in 1996, it made huge losses and needed annual cash injections from the government. Senior officials running late for international flights would sometimes delay take-off by hours.
The government now intends to run the airline like a private business, said Esther Koimett, principal secretary at Kenya's transport ministry.
""If we can put in place a proper governance structure that ensures that it can be managed independently and professionally, then we should be able to make it work,"" she said.
But some analysts are not convinced.
Kwame Owino, chief executive of the Institute of Economic Affairs in Kenya, pointed to the poor track record of state-owned entities such as the Kerio Valley Development Authority and Kenya Pipeline Co - both of whose heads are facing corruption charges.
""I doubt that they will turn the airline around,"" Owino said."

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp raised its sales and core profit outlook for 2019 and 2020 on Thursday after reporting 4% organic revenue growth in the second quarter, which it said was its best since 2008 and ahead of its expectations.
Growth was driven by recurring revenues at all three of its biggest units since the news and information provider sold a majority in its Financial and Risk business, now known as Refinitiv, to Blackstone (NYSE:BX) last year - Legal, Corporates and Tax & Accounting.
The company said that it and Blackstone had agreed to sell Refinitiv, which provides data and news to financial customers, to London Stock Exchange in a $27 billion all-share deal.
Thomson Reuters will hold a 15-percent stake in the London Stock Exchange on completion of the deal, which is expected in the second half of 2020, the companies said. A Thomson Reuters representative will also sit on the LSE board.
Under the agreement, Thomson Reuters cannot sell its LSE stake for two years following completion of the deal. It can sell a third of its shares in each of the third and fourth years after completion, and the rest thereafter.
Chief Executive Officer Jim Smith told Reuters the company will decide whether to sell its shares as the lock-up expires.
""Over the course of time, we would likely see that investment shifted behind our core businesses,"" he said.
Smith said the deal would ""create a great deal of value"" for Thomson Reuters shareholders.
A $10-billion share buyback and the launch of new products following the Blackstone deal have propelled Thomson Reuters stock 85 percent higher since May last year, and the shares hit an all-time high of C$90.04 this week.
The company said it expects 2019 and 2020 revenue growth and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to each be at the upper end of the guidance ranges previously provided.
Smith said the launch of legal research product Westlaw Edge last year had been a key driver of growth in the company's legal division, its biggest business.
""It's been a very, very solid performer for us and continues to gain a lot of traction,"" he said.
The parent of Reuters News had forecast 2019 revenue growth of 7% to 8.5% before the effect of currency, and growth of about half that pace in 2020.
For EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), Thomson Reuters had forecast $1.4-$1.5 billion for 2019, up from $1.4 billion in 2018, and an EBITDA margin of 30-31 percent for 2020.
Thomson Reuters set aside $2 billion of the $17 billion proceeds from last year's Blackstone deal for acquisitions. The company has made three acquisitions so far and has about half of the funds left for more deals, Smith said in an interview.
""We see a lot of opportunity there and we're looking at a lot of things,"" Smith said. ""We're considering a number of further options but one can never predict the timing of M&A.""
In the second quarter, revenue rose to $1.42 billion from $1.31 billion a year ago as Thomson Reuters gained from payments it received from Refinitiv for its news service. Adjusted earnings per share of 29 cents were ahead of analyst estimates of 18 cents, according to IBES from Refinitiv."

GM's strong showing came despite slumping industry demand in China, the world's largest auto market.
Other automakers, including U.S. rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), offered disappointing forecasts last week.
The automaker also faces an escalating price war in the lucrative U.S. pickup truck segment for its newly-revamped Chevrolet Silverado.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) has been battling for market share with its all-new Ram pickup and outsold the Silverado in the second quarter.
FCA took the market by surprise on Wednesday by sticking to its full-year profit guidance after a strong performance from its Ram pickup truck in North America helped it defy the industry slowdown.
GM's overall U.S. sales fell 1.5% in the second quarter.
In the second quarter, GM's China sales slid 12%, a slight improvement over the 17.5% decline in the first quarter.
GM said industry-wide sales in China should remain weak for the rest of the year, but added that its vehicle lineup in that market will be boosted by the addition of new SUVs.
GM's equity income from its Chinese operations fell to $235 million from $592 million a year earlier. The automaker said Chinese equity income in the second half of the year should roughly match the $611 million it posted for the first half.
The company said it still expects full-year 2019 earnings per share in a range from $6.50 to $7.
The automaker also said it still expects full-year adjusted automotive free cash flow in a range, meaning it would need to generate free cash flow of between $5.9 billion and $7.4 billion in the second half of the year.
GM reported second-quarter net income of $2.41 billion or $1.66 per share, compared with $2.39 billion or $1.66 per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, GM reported earnings of $1.64 per share.
Analysts had on average expected earnings per share of $1.44.
GM reported second-quarter revenue of $36.1 billion, which came in above analyst estimates of $35.98 billion."

LONDON (Reuters) - Accounting firm KPMG has been fined 3.5 million pounds ($4.24 million) by Britain's accounting watchdog for failing to audit client accounts of BNY Mellon (N:BK) bank properly, the latest in a string of penalties on KPMG for poor performance.
The fine will keep the pressure on Britain's government to come forward with legislation that implements a proposed shake-up of auditing, including a more powerful watchdog.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said on Thursday that in 2011, BNY Mellon held more than a trillion pounds in assets on behalf of its customers, which under ""CASS"" safekeeping rules must be audited to ensure the assets are being kept safe.
KPMG and Richard Hinton, who signed the client assets report on behalf of KPMG, admitted misconduct, the FRC said.
KPMG said it regretted that aspects of its work did not meet the standards expected by the regulator. ""We are happy to undertake the additional review process outlined by the FRC as part of our drive to improve audit quality,"" it said in a statement.
The fine was discounted from 5 million pounds for admission of misconduct. Hinton's 75,000 pound fine was discounted to 52,500 pounds, the watchdog said.
Britain's finance industry watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, had fined BNY Mellon 126 million pounds in April 2015 for failing to keep customer money safe.
In the year to March, the accounting watchdog has fined accounting firms nearly 43 million pounds, with KPMG making up nearly half of the total after admitting misconduct in audits of The Co-operative Bank, retailer Ted Baker, and professional services firm Quindell.
The watchdog had already put KPMG into close supervision measures, and on Thursday added a requirement for a quality performance review of everyone who signs a client assets report on behalf of KPMG.
Hinton was not a partner at KPMG and is not currently working as a CASS auditor, the FRC said.
The FRC has substantially increased fines on accounting firms, partly to meet criticisms from parliament that it was too timid with KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC, known as the ""Big Four"".
Accounting industry officials have expressed concerns that rocketing fines will put off people working in audit.
""We also take into account that a fine should not be such as to deter accountants from accepting audit or CASS audit engagements,"" the FRC said."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW's (DE:BMWG) second quarter earnings fell by a fifth, hit by exchange rate moves and investments in manufacturing electric and hybrid cars to help meet stricter emissions limits.
However, the German automaker stuck to its full-year forecasts, avoiding the profit warnings that have beset the industry and helping to push its shares higher on Thursday. 
""There are no major hiccups and as the product momentum is improving, so will profitability and cashflow. In an extremely volatile auto world, this is very good news,"" analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note to clients.
Carmakers are having to make huge investments into cleaner and self-driving technologies just as demand in China, the world's biggest auto market, is falling and a trade war between Washington and Beijing is curbing global economic growth. 
German rival  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and industry supplier Continental (DE:CONG) have both recently issued profit warnings, although  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stuck to their 2019 forecasts. 
BMW said earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) fell to 2.2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in second quarter, hit by the cost of trying to meet stricter emissions rules due in 2021. 
Investments in property, plant and equipment jumped 39% as the company opened a factory in Mexico and retooled its plants to introduce more flexible production lines help it double sales of electric and hybrid cars by 2021.
The Munich-based company said the operating margin at its automotive division fell to 6.5% from 8.6% a year earlier, despite a 1.5% rise in vehicle sales over the same period.
But analysts said the margin compared favorably with Mercedes-Benz's 3.6% and Audi's 8% given BMW sees higher volumes and a better mix of model sales in the second half of the year. 
BMW reiterated its forecast for a significant decrease in group profit before tax in 2019 as well as a slight increase in vehicle deliveries, and an EBIT margin of 4.5%-6.5% in the automotive division.

At 1015 GMT, its shares were up 1.2% at 67.62 euros.

According to a statement on its website, Banister Law, together with Gilbert + Tobin, filed the suit in the Federal Court alleging some vehicles were fitted with defective diesel particulate filters meant to trap and burn soot from the engine.
""The affected vehicles ... require time consuming and costly repairs, including repeated vehicle servicing and repeated replacement of the (diesel filters) in its entirety,"" Bannister Law said in the statement.

Some in the investment community argue that thanks to a more nit-picky FTC, a deal that should have been cleared with flying colors continues to be clouded with questions. Many on the Street guess that the holdup is tied to competitive concerns for Roche’s blockbuster Hemlibra, a medicine for the clotting disorder hemophilia, and a gene therapy for the disease in development from Spark.
However, the FTC’s closed-door meetings and the secrecy about its reasoning have left investors in the dark. That’s prompted jitters among investors, from those that specialize in risk arbitrage to the sell-side analysts that closely follow the space.
“Those of us in the public markets don’t have much of a clear view” on why the deal is held up, “and that creates a lot of potential execution risk for anyone else looking to make a move and vertically consolidate with a gene therapy or gene editing player to add their own disruptor,” SVB Leerink analyst Mani Foroohar said in an interview.
Betsy Lordan, a spokeswoman for the FTC, said the agency can’t confirm or comment on potential investigations. Roche has repeatedly declined to comment on the source of the holdup. Chief Executive Officer Severin Schwan wouldn’t elaborate either at a meeting last week, but said he’s “very confident” that the transaction will close by the end of the year. Swiss financial markets were closed on Thursday, and the company again declined to comment ahead of an FTC meeting in Washington.

A slowdown in smaller deals or the FTC halting the Spark-Roche tie-up would whipsaw some biopharma high-fliers that many on the Street see as logical bolt-ons for larger companies looking to replenish their pipelines. A number of the year’s top performing biotechnology companies, such as gene therapy-focused drugmaker uniQure NV, have seen shares appreciate on drug expectations paired with speculation that they may be the next shoe to drop in the sector’s spending spree.
Deals are seen as the lifeblood of biotech and drug development, with smaller companies that lack the infrastructure to bring drugs to market frequently opting to sell to those who can.
Some on Wall Street have questioned how deals for a company like uniQure would be affected by the FTC’s more hands-on approach, which may have implications for companies looking to double down in a specific disease area.
“For anyone trying to make that deal there’s a paralyzing effect,” Foroohar said. “What would’ve been seen as a low execution risk, low regulatory risk, straightforward deal is suddenly something caught up for a year and a half, and you have to look at divesting” the drug which drove the deal in the first place, he said.
Increased scrutiny
Six of the nine deal specialists Bloomberg News surveyed said they are concerned the FTC has shifted its approach, as evidenced by the Roche delays. The same proportion agreed that the stumbles for Roche and Spark may have a chilling effect on innovative deals within the space until more is understood.
The majority of concerned investors said an earlier-stage deal like Roche’s planned purchase of Spark should not warrant the level of scrutiny it’s facing. Some analysts forecast sales of Roche’s Hemlibra may near $4.9 billion annually by 2028, more than the current offer for the entirety of Spark.
“When one of the largest companies in the world is buying a minnow” and it’s being held back, “that’s very concerning,” Brad Loncar, chief executive officer of Loncar Investments, said in a phone interview. “You have to start wondering if this scrutiny will slow down or prohibit these kinds of deals, which would be a huge deal for the sector.”
While Roche’s planned purchase of Spark has garnered the majority of headlines triggering nervousness for those betting on deals, it isn’t a one-off. Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co. has agreed to divest one of  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG).’s best selling drugs to placate regulators in hope of closing their planned $74 billion deal.
Bristol-Myers’s plans to sell off the psoriasis pill, Otezla, “was a very big surprise,” according to SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges. He called the FTC actions “very strange,” adding that investors in  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV). and Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc are now focused on the future of AbbVie’s psoriasis treatment, Skyrizi.
Biopharma mergers aren’t the only deals within health care that have drawn regulatory concern. Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN).’s proposed purchase of Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. has been held up by both U.S. and U.K. agencies, while the deal’s spread remained near its widest since the announcement.
The next event on the FTC’s calendar is an Aug. 1 meeting in Washington. The group voted 5-0 to keep the meeting closed, further adding mystery to who will be in attendance and what the topic will be.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets shook off the disappointment of a half-hearted policy easing by the Federal Reserve on Thursday, encouraged by signs of a stabilization in the region’s manufacturing sector.
Purchasing managers indexes from around Europe (and in China) came in slightly higher than expected for July, with the eurozone manufacturing PMI ticking up to 46.5. While that still suggests the sector is contracting, it was an improvement from June 46.4, and would have been an even clearer one if France hadn’t provided a negative outlier.
Even the Brexit-affected U.K. PMI stayed at 48, defying expectations for another drop. It still remains at its lowest since immediately after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union in 2016, however.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark EuroSTOXX 600 was up 0.1% at 386.14, with Italy'sFTSE MIB, Spain's IBEX 35 and France's CAC 40 all outperforming the U.K. and German markets.
The PMI figures contrast with a mostly miserable set of earnings for the second quarter released earlier. Leading the losers, uncharacteristically, was Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), down 4.7% after weak gas prices pushed its profit down by 26% from a year earlier. The company’s other businesses, from upstream to chemicals, all reported weaker numbers and its debt-to-equity ratio rose further away from the targeted level of 20% - an unwelcome sign given that the company is still committed to a large buyback program.
Shell’s drop was compounded by the sharp fall in oil and other commodities overnight on the back of the Fed’s action and refusal to commit more clearly to further rate cuts. Miners and steelmakers also headed lower:   Rio Tinto   (LON:RIO) fell 3.2% despite the announcement of a $1 billion special dividend that reflected windfall profits from iron ore, prices for which spiked in the first half due to production problems at some of its biggest competitors.
German conglomerate  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) also fell 4.9% after it reported a 6% drop in earnings in the three months to June, which chief executive Jo Kaeser blamed on “geopolitics and geoeconomics”. The company’s digital business, a key source of profit, reported double-digit drops in orders in Germany and Italy, and declines of 4%-5% in China and the U.S."
1037,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 04:48AM ET</span>",Financials drive European stocks bounce after Fed hit,"(Reuters) - European shares recovered from early losses on Thursday as a solid batch of bank earnings outweighed the impact of falling expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts and a slump in Shell (LON:RDSa) shares after its worst results in more than two years.
Shares in  London Stock Exchange  Group jumped 5.9% after it formally announced its $27 billion merger with financial information firm Refinitiv, driving a 1.5% surge in Europe's financial services index (SXFP) to a record high.
 Barclays  (L:BARC) gained 2.7% after the British bank raised its interim dividend following a resilient performance by its trading unit that contrasted with weakening numbers at U.S. competitors.
Similarly, Asia-focused lender  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) rose 4.1% after topping first-half profit estimates, pulling the pan-European benchmark STOXX 600 index (STOXX) 0.2% higher.
""After a difficult Q1, when profits came in below the level a year before, Q2 appears to have been a much better quarter for Barclays,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.
""This would appear to be a welcome boost for CEO Jes Staley whose strategy for turning the bank around has come under fire.""
Both Asia and Wall Street markets had fallen overnight after the U.S. Federal Reserve as expected cut interest rates but disappointed investors hoping for a clear sign of several more cuts to come to support growth and stock market valuations.
The euro zone looks in weaker shape than the United States and a 5% slide in  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) after the German industrial said it was seeing a weaker environment in many of its key markets, illustrated Europe Inc's headaches with finding growth outside of debt-driven consumer spending.
The continent's biggest online-only fashion retailer, Zalando (DE:ZALG), underlined that trend, climbing 10.2% after raising its full-year profit outlook and following upbeat earnings from sportswear maker Puma on Wednesday.
London Stock Exchange's (L:LSE) deal to buy Refinitiv, in which Reuters News parent Thomson Reuters holds a 45% stake, had been telegraphed last week and shares in the exchange operator have reached a record high in response.
The deal will transform the British company into a market data and analytics giant and position it to compete with Bloomberg as both a distributor and creator of financial data.
The dent to sentiment from the Fed hurt commodities markets overnight, with a fall in iron ore, copper and oil prices pulling down shares in mining and energy majors.
The oil and gas sector slid 1%, while the materials index (SXPP) fell 2.5%, with London-listed shares of Rio Tinto (AX:RIO) slipped inspite of reporting a 12% jump in first-half profit and declaring a bumper dividend.
Steelmaker ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) revised down its forecast for global steel demand, with a sharper reduction expected in Europe due to a lean automotive market."
1038,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 03:43AM ET</span>",Blue-blooded crabs at heart of pharma dispute on drug testing,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - If you've received a vaccination, hip replacement or chemotherapy without suffering toxic shock, chances are you've benefited from a vast bloodletting of horseshoe crabs.
Every year, fishermen net hundreds of thousands of the creatures off the U.S. East Coast and in Asia before their prized milky-blue blood is drained for use in medical safety tests.
Swiss biotech Lonza (S:LONN) and U.S.-based Charles River Laboratories (N:CRL) are the biggest suppliers of crab blood-based endotoxin tests, which detect bacterial contamination in intravenous drugs and medical implants.
They are now at odds over the future of this testing, as Lonza urges adoption of a synthetic alternative called recombinant Factor C (rFC), amid pressure from wildlife campaigners and worries about supply reliability. 
Meanwhile Charles River, which is still studying rFC, argues moving too quickly could compromise patient safety.
There's much at stake - for both companies, the industry and, of course, horseshoe crabs, a 450-million-year-old species that's more closely related to scorpions than crustaceans. 
Endotoxin tests number 70 million annually and are rising. If rFC gains traction, it could re-shuffle winners and losers in the global market for such testing that is seen growing about 13% a year to close to $700 million in annual revenue by 2021 and $1 billion by 2024, according to market researchers. 
For Lonza, whose internal testing growth estimates are more modest, the risk is that the synthetic method won't catch on, hurting efforts to capitalize on a $460 million investment it made in 2006 when it bought the technology along with a peer's biological businesses.
Conversely, Charles River risks becoming a laggard if the technique wins wide acceptance.
PHARMACOPOEIA PUSH
The leading U.S. pharmaceuticals standards organization, U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP), which publishes a compendium of drug information, told Reuters it was pressing ahead to recognize synthetic tests as comparable to crab blood-based ones.
""There is a consensus on moving forward and USP is fully committed,"" said Fouad Atouf, USP's Science-Global Biologics head.
""Making sure all the stakeholders are on board and all the data has been collected is what's happening right now,"" he said, with proposed revisions recognizing rFC due around September for public consultation.
That coincides with a push by USP's European counterpart in Strasbourg, to recognize rFC. Japan is also working on the issue.
France's  Biomerieux  (PA:BIOX) and Germany's privately held Haemochrom Diagnostica, which have versions of rFC, are also eager to see pharmacopoeias act. 
Lonza said its rFC product, PyroGene, now accounts for less than 5 percent of its endotoxin test sales but sees fortunes changing as global pharmacopoeias act.
""We would hope to see around 10% by 2021,"" Lonza said.
It has won a big customer for PyroGene: Eli Lilly's (N:LLY) migraine medicine Emgality last year became the first rFC-tested drug to win U.S. regulatory approval.
Roche (S:ROG) and Bayer (DE:BAYGn) told Reuters they were also considering rFC.
'UNACCEPTABLE RISK'
Charles River insists additional scrutiny is necessary before rFC technology wins equal standing. 
Companies pushing rFC must prove it can detect endotoxins in the real world, not just the manufactured strains used so far in studying the synthetic agent, said John Dubczak, Charles River's microbial solutions manager.
""A move by the pharmaceutical industry towards current rFC methods is premature,"" said Dubczak, adding more data is needed.
Lonza points to analyses by multiple drugmakers demonstrating rFC was comparable to the crab-blood tests in ensuring drugs were contaminant-free.
To be sure, Lonza has no plans to stop bleeding crabs, since many existing medical products will continue to be tested with traditional methods, it said. 
The industry predicts the global crab blood-based test market will also expand in the next few years.
But Lonza is counting on rFC emerging as a new pillar of its testing business, contributing to its goal of more than 7 billion Swiss francs ($7.1 billion) in group annual revenue by 2022, from 5.5 billion francs.
NATURE'S INGENUITY
Horseshoe crabs' copper-rich blood has helped them survive since before the dinosaurs in brackish coastal waters by clotting around endotoxins, the potentially dangerous molecules found in cell walls of bacteria like E. coli. 
Scientists harnessed nature's ingenuity, using crab blood to make so-called amebocyte lysate endotoxin tests which, by the 1970s, began displacing tests on rabbits that were injected with medicine then monitored for fever. 
However, concerns have since escalated over wildlife conservation and the supply chain's reliability. 
In Asia, where horseshoe crabs are also eaten by humans, the tri-spine species is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as at risk of extinction. Two other species are also imperiled. 
Glenn Gauvry, director of the Delaware-based Ecological Research and Development Group which focuses on horseshoe crab conservation, said Asian crabs destined for dinner tables were first ""rented"" to biomedical companies for bleeding.
Gauvry contends the biomedical industry is perpetuating consumption of crabs in Asia and contributing to their decline.
Lonza does not harvest Asian crab blood. 
Charles River, which does, said it followed local rules. 
""Horseshoe crab blood is collected only to a point where the crab naturally stops bleeding,"" Dubczak said, adding its Asian suppliers and local governments were responsible for ensuring crabs were released into ""waters of appropriate salinity"".
RUFA RED KNOT
Studies paint a mixed picture of the blood harvest's effects on U.S. East Coast horseshoe crabs, hundreds of thousands of which are also killed annually for bait or caught incidentally by commercial fishermen hunting other marine species.
Those caught by Lonza, Charles River and Associates of Cape Cod, owned by Japan's  Seikagaku Corp  (T:4548), are drained of about a third of their blood, then returned alive to the sea.
An Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission report from May indicates current harvest levels ""appear to be sustainable"". 
Additionally, a recent U.S. Geological Survey study found bled crabs' survival rates may exceed those of non-bled crabs in New Jersey's Delaware Bay. 
However, previous studies found anywhere between 4% to 30% of bled crabs may die prematurely, prompting pressure on the biomedical industry, largely out of concern for shorebird populations that rely on crab eggs.
Advocates including the Audubon Society became increasingly vocal when the rufa red knot, which eats crab eggs on stopovers at Delaware Bay, was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2014.
""That was the tipping point,"" said Jay Bolden, an Eli Lilly biologist whose hobby as a birdwatcher spurred him to champion his company's switch to rFC that he believes will ensure supply-chain reliability. 
""If it got really serious, and they said nobody could touch the horseshoe crabs because they have to rebuild the red knot population, that was going to be significant.""
Lilly has shifted three of eight global drug manufacturing sites to rFC testing and is more than halfway to its goal of 90 percent rFC testing by 2020, he added. 
""Until the global pharmacopoeias revise the test method to recognize rFC as on par with crab blood-based tests, we can't just make the change for medicines that are already on the market,"" Bolden said. 

""When that happens, then we can change over that final 10 percent.""

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 03:27AM ET</span>","Asian shares tumble, dollar firms as Fed scotches big rate-cut bets","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares slipped to six-week lows on Thursday while the dollar jumped to two-year highs as the U.S. Federal Reserve rattled markets by signaling that its first rate cut in more than a decade was not the start of a lengthy easing cycle.
Investors were pricing in more than 100 basis points of easing from the Fed over the next year, sending world equities soaring to record highs in recent days. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell dented those bets, sounding far more circumspect about the need for further policy easing.
In early European deals, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures fell 0.5% while futures for Germany's DAX and London's FTSE were down 0.3% each and those of France's CAC 40 eased 0.2%.
E-minis for the S&P500 were 0.15% lower.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan faltered 0.8%, extending losses for a fifth day to the lowest since mid-June and on track for the biggest one-day percentage drop in a month.
Japan's Nikkei reversed early declines and were a shade higher, while Australian shares declined 0.4%. Losses in Chinese shares accelerated after they opened lower with the blue-chip index down 0.8%.
World shares recoiled overnight following remarks from Powell that Wednesday's 25-basis-point easing was ""not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts"".
Powell characterized the rate cut as ""a mid-cycle adjustment to policy"", citing signs of a global slowdown, simmering U.S. trade tensions and a desire to boost too-low inflation. Markets took that as a sign that the Fed will be cautious in making further cuts.
Riskier assets such as shares have had a golden run in the past decade as global central banks have kept monetary policies stimulatory, world growth has been strong and corporate profits have surged. But since the middle of last year trade disputes have become a major worry for policymakers as factory activity stuttered, while business investment and profits faltered in a blow to the global economy.
""We believe the Fed is trying to thread the needle, balancing market jitters about slowing global growth with robust consumer spending and a strong job market in the U.S.,"" said Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson.
""In other words, by cutting just 25 bps, the Fed is trying to bolster market confidence while also keeping some dry powder in reserve in case of an economic shock.""
Adding to worries, the United States and China on Wednesday ended a brief round of trade talks without much progress in ending their year-long tariff war.
Downbeat data and factory surveys on Thursday pointed to further weakness for Asia's trade-reliant economies.
South Korea's exports tumbled for an eighth straight month in July amid persistently weak global demand and an escalating dispute with Japan, while its new export orders shrank the most in about six years.
South Korea, the world's sixth-largest exporter, is the first major industrial economy to release trade data each month, providing an early assessment on the health of global demand.
Pressure on Chinese factories eased slightly, but manufacturing activity continued to shrink.
""The broader global trade dynamic remains a challenge,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Michael Zezas said. ""Trade should continue to drag on corporate confidence, capex and global growth in the near term.""

Shares in the company, which have fallen by a quarter in the past year, were down 2% in early trade.
Known for its smart men's suits, Hugo Boss has introduced more casual and sportswear styles to appeal to a younger audience, recently teaming up with former One Direction singer Liam Payne and Taiwanese-Canadian actor Mark Chao.
That strategy has been paying off in Europe - its biggest market - where sales rose 2% in the second quarter, and especially in Asia, with sales expanding at double-digit rates in China on a comparative store and currency-adjusted basis.
That mirrors a trend seen at other high-end fashion players like jacket maker Moncler (MI:MONC) and Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH), which have been riding high on demand for branded goods across Asia.
However, Hugo Boss said quarterly sales fell 3% in the Americas, which it blamed on the easing of the positive effects of tax reform, weaker business with tourists and a highly promotional market.
Overall, second-quarter operating profit rose 3% to 76 million euros ($83.97 million) on sales up a currency-adjusted 2% to 675 million euros - shy of average analyst forecasts for 79 million and 677 million.
It now expects a slight decline in currency-adjusted sales for the Americas for the full-year, compared with a previous prediction for an increase.

For the group, it expects 2019 currency-adjusted sales growth to be at the lower end of an outlook for a mid single-digit percentage rise, and operating profit to be at the lower end of its forecast for a high single-digit percentage increase.

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 02:16AM ET</span>",South Korean chip giants face 'strangling' from Japanese export curbs,"By Heekyong Yang and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean chipmakers are hitting a dead end in their quest to find alternatives for key Japanese materials that have been slapped with export restrictions, raising the prospect of major disruption to their operations in the coming months.
Japan is now requiring special approval for sales of three high-tech materials, including two that are critical for chipmaking, to South Korea amid a deepening diplomatic dispute over compensation for forced labor during World War II.
South Korea-bound exports of the materials, including hydrogen fluoride gas and chemicals known as photoresists, now require government approval. No approvals have been granted since the dispute broke in early July, South Korean industry sources said.
""Japan is slowly strangling our neck"", one senior official at a major South Korean major chipmaker told Reuters, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
South Korean chipmakers have been plotting workarounds, such as seeking supplies directly from factories in China or Taiwan owned by their Japanese suppliers, but government officials this week warned them not to go that route.
At a closed-door meeting on Monday, South Korea's chip industry group handed out government guidelines to its members, including Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and SK Hynix (KS:000660).
The guidance seen by Reuters cautioned that Japanese firms can rightly refuse to ship the materials from third countries, and that any efforts to bypass restrictions could subject both chipmakers and suppliers to broader international trade sanctions.
""Simply put, don't sweat over importing Japanese materials,"" said one official at the Korea Strategic Trade Institute who is not authorized to speak to media.
LIMITED ALTERNATIVES
Efforts to find alternatives to the Japanese suppliers have also struggled to make headway.
Although there have been offers from Russian and Chinese suppliers, chipmakers say that for most purposes they need Japan's high-purity hydrogen fluoride because it helps them get high ""yield"" rates, which is critical to making chips profitably.
Yield is especially important in manufacturing memory chips, used in everything from smartphones to vehicles and where Samsung and SK Hynix control more than half of the global market.
""Even if we want to use products from other countries to replace Japanese, it will take months to prove them as suitable for our current manufacturing systems and performance,"" a second official at a South Korean major chipmaker said, who also requested anonymity.
Major South Korean chipmakers are now testing some non-Japanese materials, South Korean deputy trade minister Kim Yong-rae told foreign media on Wednesday.
Samsung said Japanese curbs on the export of chip-making materials were blurring its business outlook as it reported a halving in quarterly profit on Wednesday.
""Even though the recent measures by the Japanese government do not ban export of materials, we are facing difficulties due to the burden of this new export approval process and uncertainties this process will bring, so the visibility is low,"" Robert Yi, Samsung's head of investor relations, said on an earnings call.
The company was reviewing various measures to minimize impact, he said, without providing further details.
The curbs on photoresists only apply to those used in producing chips based on an advanced technique known as extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography.
But that could hobble Samsung's efforts to use the technology to catch up with rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330) in the booming business of building advanced chips for other companies.
""If Japan's exports controls continue further, Samsung will inevitably face long-term consequences operating its EUV machines and a hard time meeting their production agenda,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.
South Korean chipmakers and their local suppliers are bracing for further moves by Tokyo to drop South Korea as a preferred trading partner, which would mean tighter regulations for a broader range of chip products bound for South Korea.
South Korea's top imports from Japan by value last year were semiconductor components and equipment ranging from silicon wafers to chip etching machines, according to data provided by Korea International Trade Association.
In 2018, South Korea bought a total $11 billion worth of semiconductor parts and equipment from Japan, accounting for nearly 20% of Japanese imports, the data shows.
The South Korean government has launched a campaign to nurture local suppliers to counter Japan's restrictions, but analysts and officials at suppliers say the goals are unrealistic.
""On top of local suppliers' efforts, current nationwide efforts to localize high-tech materials will continue, but we cannot replace all materials by ourselves,"" said an executive at a South Korean supplier for Samsung and SK Hynix.

1044,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 01:35AM ET</span>",Worst July in 17 Years for Indian Stocks Dims Hope for Revival,"(Bloomberg) -- Indian stocks just suffered their worst July in 17 years, and if history is to be believed, there is little hope that August will be much better.
The S&P BSE Sensex dropped 4.9% in the month that ended Wednesday, hurt by disappointment with the country’s new budget, muted corporate earnings and the ongoing credit crunch. The benchmark index has performed better in August than July in only five years since 2002, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
“We are going into August with low expectations, rather no expectation at all,” said Rajiv Singh, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. “Market should pick up the threads from here and hope it won’t get worse than this.”
The Sensex is down nearly 7% from its record high in early June after the release of the annual budget plan that raised taxes but offered little stimulus to revive growth. The Reserve Bank of India has been accommodative and is expected to deliver another rate cut this month, which may help boost consumer demand ahead of the holiday season which starts in September.
Hindustan  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) Ltd., India’s largest consumer goods company, saw volumes fall to a seven-quarter low in the June quarter on account of weak rural sales. The nation’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. on Thursday reported a 33.5% slump in July sales from a year earlier.
“Business earnings continue to elude us and the commentary from consumer companies too don’t indicate that things might quickly mend in the coming quarters,” said Dharmesh Kant, head of retail research at Mumbai-based Indianivesh Securities Ltd. “If the slowdown persists into the festival season, FY20 too will have to be written off.”"

Liu Zhongtian, owner and former chairman of Zhongwang was accused of lying to U.S. customs agents to evade duties imposed in 2011 on certain types of aluminum imported into the U.S. from China, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Nicola Hanna.
“This indictment outlines the unscrupulous and anti-competitive practices of a corrupt businessman who defrauded the United States out of US$1.8 billion in tariffs due on Chinese imports,” prosecutors said in the statement.
""Moreover, the bogus sales of hundreds of millions of dollars of aluminium artificially inflated the value of a publicly traded company, putting at risk investors around the world.""
According to Bloomberg, the prosecutors also allege Liu was behind a “massive” money-laundering scheme. He took a plea deal in exchange for cooperation with federal investigators, the article said.
Zhongwang Holdings’ shares last traded at $3.37 by 1:30 AM ET (05:30 GMT), down 16%. It was down as much as 22% earlier in the day."
1046,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 01:24AM ET</span>",Chinese drugmaker Chipscreen's STAR Market IPO sees feverish demand,"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shenzhen Chipscreen Biosciences, which plans to list on China's red-hot new tech board, said its newly issued shares were almost 3,000-times oversubscribed among retail investors, despite an eye-popping offer pricing of 468-times earnings.
While the scramble reflects a strong appetite for listings on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market, which was launched in June, it also underlines the challenge for bankers to value IPOs for tech start-ups as regulators let market prices play their role in setting prices.
Chipscreen , which develops original drugs for tumors and diabetes, said in an exchange filing on Thursday that shares reserved for individual investors - accounting for about one fifth of the IPO - were 2,956.25 times oversubscribed.
The company has set the price for its initial public offering (IPO) at 20.43 yuan per share, or 467.51 times 2018 earnings, the highest so far for a STAR Market company.
In contrast, China-listed pharmaceutical firms, traded at an average earnings multiple of 30.79 over the past month.
The feverish demand values Chipscreen at 8.38 billion yuan ($1.21 billion), and would allow the company to raise 1 billion yuan - 27% more than originally planned.
In a roadshow on Tuesday, Chipscreen founder Lu Xianping said the company will use the IPO proceeds to ""strengthen competitiveness, expand market share, and develop new products in a bid to make growth sustainable"".
Chipscreen's share offering came a week after the frenzied debut of the first batch of 25 companies on the science and technology board on July 22. The companies surged roughly 140% on average on that day.
Chipscreen has not disclosed when it will debut on the STAR Market, which has attracted a slew of Chinese drugmakers to list. One drug developer, Suzhou Zelgen Biopharmaceuticals Co, plans to list before it sells any products to patients, potentially testing investors' risk tolerance.
The new tech board potentially competes with Hong Kong, which last year revised listing rules to allow so-called pre-revenue, or pre-profit biotech firms to go public in the city.
Under the new listing regime, 10 biotech firms have floated in Hong Kong as of May, raising over HK$33 billion ($4 billion).
Shares of Ascletis Pharma (HK:1672), the first biotech firm to list in Hong Kong under the new rules, are trading about 66% below is IPO price, while performances of the rest are mixed.

1047,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 12:55AM ET</span>",China Zhongwang Tumbles After U.S. Charges Billionaire Owner,"(Bloomberg) -- China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd. fell as much as 21% in Hong Kong after the aluminum firm’s billionaire owner was charged by U.S. prosecutors with evading $1.8 billion in American anti-dumping tariffs.
Liu Zhongtian, the former president and chairman of Zhongwang, Asia’s largest aluminum extrusion company, lied to U.S. customs agents to avoid duties imposed in 2011 on certain types of aluminum imported into the U.S. from China, according to a statement Wednesday from U.S. Attorney Nicola Hanna in Los Angeles after a grand jury indictment was unsealed.
The company’s decline in the first ten minutes of trading wiped out this year’s gain and saw shares touch their lowest since 2016.
“This indictment outlines the unscrupulous and anti-competitive practices of a corrupt businessman,” prosecutors said in the statement.
Liu, 55, is believed to be in China, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney.
The aluminum extrusions were disguised when they were shipped to the U.S. as pallets to qualify them as finished goods and avoid customs duties of as much as 400%, according to the prosecutors. The company and Liu are accused of orchestrating bogus sales of the 2.2 million imported pallets, which were actually stockpiled in Southern (NYSE:SO) California because there was no demand for them.
A Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Zhongwang, which is based in Liaoyang, Liaoning on the mainland, declined to comment.
Liu and the company would direct that aluminum melting facilities be built and acquired to reconfigure the pallets into a form with commercial value, according to the indictment.
Money Laundering
Prosecutors also allege Liu was behind a “massive” money-laundering scheme. One of his associates was charged with evading income taxes on more than $9 million he received in 2015. He took a plea deal in exchange for cooperation with federal investigators, prosecutors said.
Hundreds of millions of dollars were allegedly funneled through shell companies, which were then directed to aluminum companies in the U.S. that Liu ran, according to the indictment.
Zhongwang, controlled by Liu, has run into other regulatory issues in the U.S. In 2016, the Commerce Department found that it withheld information during its investigation of the company’s aluminum shipments and impeded proceedings. Zhongwang President Lu Changqing said then that his firm didn’t participate in the inquiry because it stopped making the products cited in early 2015.
The Commerce Department findings came just as Liu was seeking to buy Cleveland-based aluminum parts maker Aleris Corp. in what could have been China’s biggest-ever purchase of an overseas metals processor. The deal was terminated a year later, after it failed to get approval from U.S. regulators.
Trump Administration
The case pre-dates the Trump administration’s introduction of steel and aluminum tariffs last year. But it illustrates the problem those tariffs were meant to address.
The U.S. initiated its global tariffs in large part because U.S. producers argued they were unable to compete with a flood of Chinese aluminum and steel onto international markets. Beyond producing a mountain of those metals, Chinese companies were consistently finding ways to evade U.S. anti-dumping tariffs of as much as 400% and other efforts to address the economic threat, according to the U.S. firms.
Canada and Mexico agreed earlier this year to do more to block the trans-shipment of Chinese metals destined for the U.S. as part of a deal with the Trump administration to remove the tariffs. But they are still in place on steel from other major U.S. allies including the European Union and Japan.
Meanwhile, Trump’s trade war with China and the tariffs he has imposed on some $250 billion in imports has led to new efforts by Chinese, U.S. and other companies to find a way around those import taxes, mostly by relocating production."
1048,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 12:26AM ET</span>",Democrats pass up chance to dent GM on job cuts in Detroit debates,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Detroit-based General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) emerged from two days of Democratic debates in its hometown largely unscathed as 2020 White House hopefuls largely passed up an opportunity to criticize it for significant job cuts in recent months.
The largest U.S. automaker has come under fierce criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike for months after its November announcement that it would end production at five North American assembly plants and eliminate about 14,700 jobs. It had been bracing for searing attacks when Democrats descended on Detroit for the second round of debates on Tuesday and Wednesday.
GM even sent out fact sheets to reporters touting the company’s U.S. employment and its $23 billion in investments in U.S. facilities since 2009.
And on Tuesday, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez held a news conference outside GM's Warren transmission plant just north of Detroit that is ending operations on Thursday ""to highlight Trump’s ""broken promises."" In October 2016, Trump came to Warren and said: ""If I’m elected, you won’t lose one plant. ... You’re going to have jobs again.""
But the automaker was hardly mentioned and largely avoided most direct criticism.
Not one candidate mentioned GM by name on the first night, even as a moderator specifically asked South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg about GM’s job cuts and what his plan was for retraining workers.
He answered that beyond job training, workers in gig economy jobs should be allowed to ""unionize, because a gig is a job and a worker is a worker.""
Julian Castro, a former San Antonio mayor and top U.S. housing official, on Wednesday noted GM's job cuts as an example of the economic uncertainty facing the country, but stopped short of leveling more direct criticism at the automaker.
""Go and just ask the folks that just received notice that they are going to get laid off by General Motors, or ask the many folks who are sleeping on the streets in big cities and small towns across the United States, or ask fast-food workers that I joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and can't provide for their families or pay the rent,"" Castro said.
And when former Vice President Joe Biden brought up GM, it was not about the job reductions but to remind the voters in Michigan of the 2009 GM bailout under the administration of then-President Barack Obama, to whom he served as No. 2 for eight years.
""I was part of the organization -- and within our administration -- that pushed bailing General Motors out, saving tens of thousands of jobs here in this state,"" Biden said on Wednesday, the second night of back-to-back debates.
At times the candidates referenced job losses in the auto sector or manufacturing jobs that have disappeared because of automation but mostly skipped direct references to GM, whose headquarters is a few blocks from where the debates were held.""If you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall-to-wall immigrants; you will find wall-to-wall robots and machines,"" said entrepreneur and philanthropist Andrew Yang. According to government data, U.S. and foreign auto manufacturers have added about 25,000 U.S. jobs since the start of 2017.
For its part, GM said in the fact sheet distributed to reporters that it is adding more than 2,000 additional jobs at other U.S. plants and offered jobs at other factories to nearly all the hourly workers at plants ending production -- though it did not extend those offers to thousands of salaried workers who lost their jobs.
GM did not comment after the debate."
1049,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 12:17AM ET</span>","Sales slumps in China, India clobber automakers banking on Asia for growth","By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Steep drops in auto sales for China and India over recent months are serving as a painful reminder that the world's two most populous markets are not living up to earlier heady expectations.
Take China for instance. Former Beijing Automotive Group Co Ltd (BAIC) President Wang Dazong confidently predicted in 2010 that annual sales in the world's biggest car market would hit 40 million vehicles by 2020. More circumspect but still bullish, the Chinese government said two years ago it was targeting 35 million by 2025.
Today, neither prediction gels well with the reality on the ground.
Hit by a slowing economy, the U.S.-China trade war and the chaotic implementation of new emission rules, vehicle sales logged a 12th straight month of declines in June. Industry officials and analysts now expect car demand to slide some 5% this year after a 2.8% fall last year to 28.1 million - its first decline since the 1990s.
The slump is exacerbating problems of excess capacity, with factory utilization rates at China plants for many automakers estimated below break-even point. Last year, Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269) became the first big foreign car manufacturer to shut up shop in the country.
""What we're seeing in China, we're seeing the market increasingly moving towards maturity, it's a case of peaking demand,"" said a head of China operations at a major global automaker, adding the market was beginning to become cyclical.
Like other industry executives, he declined to be quoted by name ahead of second-quarter earnings. 
Shrinking markets in China as well as India spell lower earnings for many automakers, which have invested heavily in plants and vehicle development in both countries on expectations they would power global auto sales growth for years to come.
The slumps in sales also come at time when car makers can ill afford them. Costs are jumping as the industry strives to meet new emissions standards and develop electric vehicles while wrestling with competition from tech firms in self-driving vehicles as well as from ride-hailing companies.
(For a graphic on 'China, India car sales' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2ymSUgH)
Auto sales in Asia-Pacific, estimated at around 43-44 million vehicles last year, are expected to fall 2-3.5% this year after declining roughly 1% in 2018, data from IHS Markit and LMC Automotive shows. 
While a small bounce back is expected for 2020, they expect sluggish to flat growth for some years to come - one that calls for 'a mindset reset' says May Arthapan, director of Asia-Pacific forecasting at LMC.
""We'd better get used to an adjusted view of Asia,"" she said.
UNFULFILLED PROMISE 
If China's slowdown has had the biggest impact, India has perhaps been the biggest disappointment, failing to live up to hopes it would become Asia's ""next China"", auto industry executives say. 
With 1.3 billion people, its population is similar in size to China's but annual vehicle sales stood at 3.3 million in the last financial year to end-March. That's far short of earlier analysts' predictions of more than 5 million by 2020.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision in 2016 to abolish high denomination bank notes in a crackdown on corruption hurt India's informal cash-based economy and with it car sales. Higher taxes and insurance costs have also raised the cost of vehicle ownership. 
The auto market then took a sharp turn for the worse amid a liquidity crisis in the non-bank financing sector which saw its willingness to extend car loans wither away. Monthly auto sales have tumbled 17-20% since April, exacerbating a slump that has seen sales decline in 11 of the past 12 months.
The downturn has led to cuts in production or temporary plant shutdowns with some automakers taking more drastic measures. General Motors Co (N:GM) stopped selling cars in India at the end of 2017 while  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) is looking at folding its India operations into a joint venture, sources told Reuters in April.
EXCESS CHINA CAPACITY 
But due to its market size, automakers are most concerned about China. In addition to economic and trade headwinds, in big cities across China, including Beijing and Shanghai, there just doesn't seem to be enough space on the roads to cater to more demand.
""Who wants to buy a car when the most likely outcome of your new purchase is to be stuck in hopeless traffic,"" said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. 
That has led to a market with fewer winners. Brands with a strong presence and growing sales include Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and Mercedes Benz but others have seen painful slides in sales and must deal with excess manufacturing capacity.
According to U.S. consulting firm AlixPartners, 2018 capacity utilization rates at China assembly plants operated by  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270),  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA),  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and Ford were below 50%. Normally, rates of around 70-75% are considered the break-even threshold.
Among foreign automakers, PSA and Ford had the lowest rates at just 26% and 24% each.
PSA's joint venture partner Dongfeng Group was so concerned about the state of their business that Chairman Zhu Yanfeng last year tried to convince Honda and Nissan to take over one of PSA's China assembly plants, sources with knowledge of the matter said. 
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media on the matter.
A Paris-based PSA spokesman said the automaker was working hard to change its China business model and that one option ""could be 'capacity rental' to other car-makers."" Honda, Nissan and Dongfeng declined to comment.
Ford, Hyundai and Kia declined to comment on their China capacity utilization rates, while Fiat Chrysler did not respond to a request for comment. A Paris-based Renault spokeswoman said the rate estimated by AlixPartners was ""skewed"" because the automaker is overhauling its product lineup.
Despite the current slump, Zhang notes the China market has much room to grow, estimating there are only 170 vehicles per 1,000 people compared to 550 per 1,000 for Japan and 800 per 1,000 in the United States. It will just take more time than most in the industry would like. 
""I can still see annual demand rising to 35 million... but that would probably take 10-15 years to achieve,"" he said.

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 12:13AM ET</span>",Seeds of London Stock Exchange deal planted at flower show,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Mike Spector and Greg Roumeliotis
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The  London Stock Exchange  Group Plc’s (L:LSE) expected $27 billion purchase of financial-data business Refinitiv has its origins in May 2013, amid the crocuses, champagne and corporate hobnobbing of London’s Chelsea Flower Show. 
Italian investment banker Matteo Canonaco brokered an introduction between David Craig, who at the time ran Thomson Reuters Corp’s (TO:TRI) Financial and Risk division, the company that became Refinitiv last year, and Joseph Baratta, head of private equity at Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX). The meeting would set in motion a sequence of events involving Blackstone, Refinitiv and the LSE that led to a deal expected as soon as this week. 
Craig and Canonaco, who now runs advisory firm Canson Capital Partners, pitched Baratta with an idea: The F&R unit would be better off split from Thomson Reuters, where the duo felt it was not getting enough investment, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. 
In order to do that they would have to overcome several hurdles, starting with the need to find an investor with deep pockets willing to back the idea, the sources said. As one of the top executives at the world’s largest private equity firm, Baratta could play that role, according to the sources. 
Baratta was intrigued at the flower show and wanted to hear more, the sources said.
Craig felt the division, which sells data and analytics to traders, investors and other financial customers, could be a good fit with an exchange operator, especially the LSE, but he did not share that with Baratta at the show, one of the sources said. 
However, by the time Blackstone inked its deal with Thomson Reuters, some of Blackstone’s dealmakers had reached the same conclusion.
Blackstone, the LSE and Thomson Reuters declined to comment. Refinitiv and Craig did not respond to requests for comment. 
Refinitiv’s merger with LSE will come just 10 months after Blackstone bought a majority stake in the unit from Thomson Reuters, in a deal that closed last October. LSE hopes Refinitiv will help it transform into a major global market data and infrastructure player.
It is a quick sale for a private equity firm, which typically holds on to assets for three to five years. Blackstone and its co-investors will immediately double on paper their roughly $4 billion investment in Refinitiv, two sources close to Blackstone said. The private equity firm will be paid with LSE shares and expects to remain invested for years. 
UNIQUE CHALLENGES
Craig and Baratta followed up the meeting at the flower show with several others, and were joined by Thomson Reuters executives and bankers. Although Baratta had been intrigued, Blackstone initially thought a purchase of F&R would be too big of a bet for the firm at the time, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Craig also separately spoke over the years with LSE, then led by Xavier Rolet, about the possibility of a deal for F&R, but the exchange executive was not confident that his board would back it, one source with knowledge of the matter said. Another source familiar with the situation said Rolet saw more value in deals that added to the exchange operator’s trading assets. Rolet declined to comment.
A buyout of the F&R business had some unique challenges. At Thomson Reuters, an independent board of directors, called Founders Share Company trustees, had oversight over the Reuters news agency and could veto deals viewed as threatening its independence and freedom from bias. Reuters provides news on F&R products, including Eikon terminals, its largest customer. 
Further, some members of the Thomson Reuters board, including chairman David Thomson, did not initially want to sell the F&R division because they worried a deal could undervalue the business, according to two sources. 
A representative for Thomson declined to comment.
By the summer of 2016, three sources close to Blackstone said the private equity firm had come up with a structure for a deal for F&R. Dubbed Project York by bankers, the deal envisioned Blackstone buying a 55% stake in the business, according to two sources close to Blackstone. 
Negotiations with Thomson Reuters started in earnest in the summer of 2017, with Craig, Blackstone Senior Managing Director Martin Brand and Thomson Reuters CEO Jim Smith gathering at Blackstone's New York offices in July. The talks culminated in a handshake deal at a dinner at Toronto’s Bymark restaurant on December 4, attended by Blackstone and Thomson Reuters executives and their advisors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Before signing the deal in early 2018, Blackstone dealmakers told their firm’s investment committee that a sale of the division to an exchange operator could be one possible exit strategy, two of the sources said.
Reuters was left behind with Thomson Reuters. Under the deal inked with Blackstone, the news agency continued to operate independently under the Trust Principles and was guaranteed annual payments of $325 million for 30 years, plus an annual inflation increase. The LSE will inherit this arrangement.

RHINO, LEOPARD AND TIGER
When LSE said in April 2018 that David Schwimmer, a longtime  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) banker, would take over as CEO that August, the stars aligned for a deal between Refinitiv and the exchange operator.
Blackstone’s Brand had grown close to Schwimmer, who had done deals for the private equity firm. Last year, he helped sell capital markets data provider Ipreo, owned by Blackstone and Goldman, to IHS  Markit Ltd  (N:INFO) for $1.9 billion, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Brand did not wait for the Refinitiv deal to close to plant the idea of a merger with LSE in Schwimmer’s mind last year. The future of the financial services industry, Brand’s pitch to Schwimmer went, was in marrying trading and data offerings. LSE should lead the way, he told Schwimmer, according to one of the sources close to Blackstone. 
Initially, Schwimmer was reluctant to do a big deal early in his tenure as CEO, three of the sources said. But in April of this year, Schwimmer learned that Blackstone was in advanced talks with Deutsche Boerse AG (DE:DB1Gn) to sell a foreign exchange trading business of Refinitiv for more than $3 billion, four sources said. 
Emboldened by an 18% run-up in LSE’s stock in the first quarter and having persuaded a new chairman at LSE to back a deal, Schwimmer felt he had to move before Deutsche Boerse bought the forex trading unit, one of the sources said.
Representatives for LSE and Schwimmer declined to comment. 
Blackstone slowed down talks with Deutsche Boerse to give LSE time to put together an offer, according to two sources close to Blackstone. Bankers nicknamed the deal Project Africa, referring to Refinitiv as rhino, LSE as leopard and Thomson Reuters as tiger, they said.

By May, they had a handshake agreement, according to four sources. Craig is expected to lead Refinitiv within LSE, to sit on the exchange operator’s executive committee and get some shares in the company, one of the sources said.

1051,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 11:03PM ET</span>",Beyond Meat Investors Sell $480 Million of Discounted Shares,"(Bloomberg) -- Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc. and its inside shareholders priced a secondary offering at $160 per share Wednesday, handing early investors a slice of profits and adding to company coffers as it looks to fund expanded production in an increasingly crowded vegan marketplace.
The offering price represents an 18.58% discount to Wednesday’s close. Shareholders locked in the nearly 700% gain from this year’s best-performing IPO, selling 3 million of the 3.25 million shares sold, according to a statement confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg. That amounts to proceeds of $480 million for holders, who sold off small portions of their stakes.
The company raised about $40 million from its portion of the deal. Shares fell about 6% in post-market trading.
The transaction lets early investors such as Kleiner Perkins and Obvious Ventures and executives including Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown take profits after an almost eight-fold gain since the stock’s debut. News of the offering, announced alongside better-than-expected earnings on Monday, sent shares tumbling and put a damper on what had been another upbeat earnings report from Beyond Meat, with sales surpassing analysts’ estimates. Shares bounced back on Wednesday, erasing some of Tuesday’s 12% plunge, to trade to $196.51 each.
Beyond Meat on Monday boosted its sales guidance as it attracts a growing list of restaurant clients for its plant-based burgers and sausages. The El Segundo, California-based company now expects at least $240 million in revenue this year -- almost triple 2018’s total.
The most recent partner is Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc., which started testing a Beyond Sausage breakfast sandwich in Manhattan before a planned nationwide rollout. Beyond Meat products are also on the menu at Tim Hortons, TGI Fridays, Carl’s Jr. and Del Taco.
Restaurants are racing to line up non-meat menu items as Americans warm to patties and sausages that mimic the flavors and textures of the real thing but are made with plants. Meat eaters are also increasingly trying out the products.
The rapid growth -- and the potential for much more -- has captured investors’ attention, pushing its market value to $12 billion in a meteoric rally since its IPO, when it first priced shares at $25 apiece to raise $277 million. But the exuberance has drawn its share of detractors as well. Short sellers betting the stock will fall have borrowed about 45% of the company’s float, amassing bets totaling $1.02 billion of market value, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.

1052,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 10:59PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Dives as Fed's Powell Muddies Waters on Future Cuts,"Investing.com - Stocks fell sharply Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate to support the domestic economy amid slowing global growth, but indicated more cuts are up in the air.
The selloff was due in part to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell confusing investors by first suggesting the cut might be the only cut and then saying there might be more. His first comment cause a huge selloff, sending the Dow Jones industrials down as many as 478 points before buying came in to pull the index back from the brink. 
The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped off about 1.2%. The Dow was off 1.2%. Only 13 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 showed gains.
Among the strongest stocks of the day was Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), up 2% after a strong earnings report on Tuesday. It was one of just four Dow stocks in the green on the day, along with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) and chemical maker Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW).
The Dow, off 334 points, and S&P 500, down 33 points, suffered their worst one-day point losses since May 31, when the Dow fell 355 points and the S&P fell 37 points. The Nasdaq's loss was its worst one-day loss since June 25.
The S&P 500 was up 1.3% in July. The Nasdaq added 2.1%. The Dow rose 1%.
 
The selloff was prompted by investors' unhappiness with Fed boss Powell's explanation of why the FOMC cut its federal funds rate to 2% to 2.25% from 2.25% to 2.5%, its first cut in a decade.
In his news conference after the rate cut announcement, Powell struggled to explain the need for a cut when the domestic economy is performing well. He said he was more worried about business investment, global growth and dealing with rising trade tensions. The last was causing many businesses to hold off on investment decisions, he said.
He caused much confusion for many traders first by suggesting the cut was a one-and-done, saying the rate cut was just a ""mid-cycle adjustment."" Then, he said there might be more cuts. At the end of the conference, he also indicated more hikes were on the table. He wouldn't say how many. 
President Trump tweeted he thought the rate cut was too small.
That helped stocks cut their losses.
Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool gives a 57% chance of another rate cut in September to 1.75% to 2%. There's a 37% chance of a rate cut in December.
Oil prices were higher. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 53 cents to $58.58 a barrel and ended July up 0.2%. {{8833|Brent } crude futures ended up 45 cents to $65.17. 
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.013% from 2.061% on Tuesday. It was up 1% for the month.
None of the 11 sectors of the S&P 500 were higher on the day. Energy shares had the smallest loss.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian casino giant  Crown  Resorts (AX:CWN) issued full-page newspaper ads on Thursday describing recent media reports that alleged it pressured officials to fast-track visas for Chinese gamblers as a ""deceitful campaign"".
Following the reports by several news outlets, Attorney General Christian Porter said on Tuesday he had referred the allegations to an anti-corruption body that investigates federal agencies, since they related to government officials.
After days of issuing brief statements denying wrongdoing, Crown circulated a letter signed by its board late on Wednesday, accusing the papers of waging a ""deceitful campaign"" that had unfairly attempted to damage its reputation.
""Much of this unbalanced and sensationalized reporting is based on unsubstantiated allegations, exaggerations, unsupported connections and outright falsehoods,"" the directors said in the letter.
Signatories included Crown Executive Chairman John Alexander, former finance department head Jane Halton, former communications minister Helen Coonan and Geoff Dixon, the former chief executive of Qantas Airways (AX:QAN).
That statement appeared as full-page advertisements in papers owned by News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) on Thursday. However, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age newspapers, which published the articles, said they had refused to run the advertisements and instead carried a line-by-line response to Crown's statement.
""The stories were carefully sourced using Crown's internal documents, former employees, credible commentators, dozens of sources from the industry, law enforcement and elsewhere, and careful verification,"" the newspapers wrote in response to the Crown's letter.
The papers, owned by Nine Entertainment Co Holdings (AX:NEC), added that they had asked Crown for an interview and sent 63 questions days before the reports, to which Crown responded ""with a short statement"" declining to comment on individuals.
Crown shares have fallen 6.4% in three trading days since the papers, and Nine's ""60 Minutes"" television news program started running the reports."

In a letter to Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger dated July 31, attorney Glenn Pomerantz said the states are requesting a new trial-ready date of Dec. 9 or as soon after that date that the court can schedule the trial, adding that the Oct. 7 trial date proposed earlier is ""unworkable.""
The states said they are still awaiting documents from the companies and it may take until late next month until they receive them. The companies ""now unfairly seek to sandbag (the suing) states by forcing them to go to trial in just two months on a new transaction they have not had an opportunity to fully examine.""
Judge Lehrburger has set a hearing for Thursday on the case in New York.
Sprint and T-Mobile did not immediately comment late on Wednesday.

Last week, the U.S. Justice Department approved the tie-up, clearing a major hurdle to a deal that would merge the United States' third and fourth largest wireless carriers. The companies have agreed to divest Sprint's prepaid businesses including Boost Mobile to Dish Network Corp in order to move ahead with the merger.

(Reuters) - The four major U.S. television networks on Wednesday sued a non-profit group backed by AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) that streams TV channels over the internet for free without permission. 
The lawsuit was filed in U.S. district court in New York by CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's NBCUniversal Media, Fox Corporation's Fox Television Stations and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's ABC against Sports Fans Coalition NY (SFCNY) and its founder, David Goodfriend, a former executive at satellite TV provider Dish. 
Major broadcasters traditionally charge cable and satellite pay television providers like AT&T and Dish a fee to distribute their content. But by giving viewers that content for free, the free service, Locast, is threatening these fees. 
The lawsuit comes as disputes over renewing carriage deals have led to channels being pulled off the air.
“Locast has been operating for more than a year and a half, and no broadcaster has filed until now,” said David Hosp, an attorney at Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, representing Goodfriend. Hosp said the group's non-profit status and the fact that it was not charging for the service put it on ""sound legal footing.""
Broadcasters disagreed. “Locast is not the Robin Hood of television; instead, Locast’s founding, funding, and operations reveal its decidedly commercial purposes,” according to the lawsuit.
Goodfriend, a lawyer who also worked for the Clinton administration and the Federal Communications Commission, launched Locast in early 2018 in New York City, and the service now covers 30% of U.S. TV households, including the nine largest markets. 
The case draws parallels to Aereo Inc, a startup launched by Barry Diller in 2012 that streamed broadcast TV signals to subscribers for $1 a day or $80 per year. Like Locast, Aereo did not pay the broadcasters for the retransmission. 
Aereo was sued in 2012 by numerous broadcasters. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled the next year that Aereo violated copyright law, making it illegal. Aereo ceased operations.
Locast has become a third party in the often contentious relationship between broadcasters and distributors. In June AT&T, which is currently in a contract dispute with both CBS and Nexstar, announced it was donating $500,000 to SFCNY. On May 30 AT&T added the Locast app to its DirecTV and U-verse receivers.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale SA (SA:VALE3) on Wednesday said it swung to a quarterly loss as the company announced more than $2 billion in fresh writedowns related to two deadly dam bursts suffered by the company over a period of less than four years.
In late January, the collapse of a Vale tailings dam storing muddy mining waste near the town of Brumadinho killed nearly 250 people, less than four years after a deadly disaster at the company's Samarco joint venture with BHP Group (AX:BHP).
The world's largest iron ore exporter has since been grappling with the fallout, which has forced it to shake up its board, replace its CEO and made it the target of various criminal and regulatory probes.
The company's newly installed Chief Executive Eduardo Bartolomeo said in a statement that Vale's key priority, in addition to beefing up safety efforts, was to ""reduce uncertainties"" and ""deliver sustainable results.""
Vale said it took $1.5 billion in writedowns for the cost of environmental measures and agreements related to the Brumadinho disaster as well as a $257 million charge to shut down its Germano dam. It also set aside $383 million for the Renova foundation, which is supposed to distribute funds to the victims of the Samarco disaster.
Those charges came on top of $4.95 billion in first quarter writedowns for payments to victims and other settlements as well as a plan to shut down dams to avoid a recurrence of the disasters.
As a result, Vale reported a net loss of $133 million after a year-ago profit of $76 million and compared with a Refinitiv mean forecast for earnings of $2.84 billion.
Revenue rose 6.6% from a year earlier to $9.19 billion, shy of a forecast of $9.59 billion, lifted by higher iron ore prices, offset by declining nickel and copper prices.
""The bottom line is that we view today's results as another weak quarter, though we are encouraged by Vale's plans to restart additional iron ore capacity,"" Clarksons Platou Securities analyst Scott Schier said in a research note, adding that he expected its shares to fall slightly as a result.
Vale shares are down 2.3 percent for the year to date, although they have rebounded from a sharp drop following the dam burst.
Higher iron ore prices triggered in part by Vale's woes have bolstered key global rival  Anglo American  (L:AAL), which last week reported stronger-than-forecast first half results and boosted its dividend and share buyback program. Rio Tinto Ltd (AX:RIO) is expected on Thursday to report its biggest first-half profit in at least six years.
Vale reported last week that iron ore output in the quarter tumbled by more than a third because of various dam and mine shutdowns triggered by January's disaster."

(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) raised its 2019 forecast on Wednesday, but disclosed more than $1 billion in potential costs from Boeing's grounded 737 MAX jetliner, puncturing an early share rally.
Boston-based GE, which makes 737 MAX engines in a joint venture, also said Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller, who was appointed in October 2017, plans to step down after a successor is hired. The company which also makes power plants and medical devices did not specify a time frame.
GE appeared to cheer investors by saying it might generate as much as $1 billion in free cash flow this year, compared with a potential outflow of $2 billion that it forecast in May. GE also raised its profit outlook by 5 cents a share.
""There should be some relief from the raised EPS and free cash flow"" forecast,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Julian Mitchell said.
But GE's portfolio of low-margin industrial businesses remains a concern. GE posted red ink again after two profitable quarters, due mainly to a $744-million goodwill charge for its power grid business. GE spent less on restructuring than analysts expected, which underpinned its performance.
GE also received a tax benefit worth 6 cents a share that more than accounted for its increased profit forecast. 
""The EPS increase of 5 cents ... is less than this quarter's 6-cent tax benefit,"" Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch said in a note. The cash flow increase ""appears to be heavily driven by ... reduced cash restructuring drag,"" he added.
After surging 4% in premarket trading, GE shares fell less than 1% to $10.45.
Graphic: GE shares under CEO Culp - https://tmsnrt.rs/2yqnVjR
GE's industrial businesses suffered another tough three months, with margins falling by as much as 8 percentage points at renewable energy. But they generated more cash than expected, in part because it has become more aggressive in billing customers, collecting payments and reducing inventory, Chief Executive Larry Culp said on a conference call.
GE's power business, which has long been a drag on earnings, posted a $117-million profit. But its relatively strong aviation business suffered as problems stretched on with Boeing's 737 MAX jetliner, which regulators grounded in March.
CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France's  Safran  SA (PA:SAF), supplies engines for the 737 MAX. 
The MAX could cost GE $1.4 billion in cash if the plane remains grounded all year, as now appears possible, GE said. 
""That was not in the previous guidance,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray, who added that investors reacted by selling GE after the conference call.
But airlines will fly older planes in place of the MAX and those use more spare parts, a lucrative product line for GE, Dray said. ""We have to believe GE has ample contingency in their free cash flow outlook to have taken a bold, unexpected step to increase guidance,"" Dray said. ""No one was expecting them to.""
Investors have watched GE's cash generation as it has failed to keep pace with earnings in recent years, raising concerns that GE's actual financial performance was falling short of stated results. But in May Culp said he would focus on generating cash and let earnings be ""almost like a byproduct,"" Dray said. 
GE said it now expects higher industrial revenue growth and bumped up earnings per share by 5 cents to between 55 cents and 65 cents. It shifted its forecast for industrial free cash flow to between negative $1 billion and positive $1 billion, from $0 to negative $2 billion.

Loss per share from continuing operations was 3 cents, down from a profit of 8 cents a year ago. On an adjusted basis, GE earned 17 cents per share, including the tax gain, compared with analysts estimates of 12 cents, on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue fell 1.1% to $28.8 billion.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cisco Systems (O:CSCO) Inc has agreed to settle a whistleblower’s claim that it improperly sold video surveillance software with known vulnerabilities to U.S. federal and state governments, marking the first payout on a False Claims Act case brought over failure to meet cybersecurity standards.
The settlement and underlying claim were unsealed on Wednesday, eight years after the initial legal complaint. Cisco paid $8.6 million to resolve the case, with most of that going to the federal government and 15 state buyers and more than $1 million going to the whistleblower, James Glenn.
""We are pleased to have resolved a 2011 dispute involving the architecture of a video security technology product,"" said Cisco spokeswoman Robyn Blum. ""There was no allegation or evidence that any unauthorized access to customers' video occurred as a result of the architecture.""
Glenn attorney Anne Hayes Hartman and other experts believe Cisco's payout is the first in a false claims cyber case.
Many more whistleblower claims could ensue, experts said. The settlement “clearly provides an opportunity for entrepreneurial plaintiffs or potential plaintiffs to go around looking for more examples like this,” said Georgetown University law professor Gregory Klass.
Hundreds of false-claim suits are filed yearly, in part because of built-in rewards for those who point out improper conduct by government contractors. Under the law, a whistleblower must provide nonpublic information in order to win an award.
With many contracts including pledges that products meet cyber security standards set by the government, experts have long warned that the claims could expand into that area and punish vendors for the vulnerabilities that are present in many systems.
Cisco’s Video Surveillance Manager was used by Los Angeles International Airport, the Washington D.C. police and the New York City public transit system, as well as many schools, said Hartman.
The complaint unsealed Wednesday also names as customers the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.
Glenn was working at a Cisco partner in Denmark called NetDesign, the complaint says, among other things working with Danish police. In 2008, he warned Cisco that a hacker who got into one camera that was part of the system could use flaws in the software to get administrative control of the entire network. The suit says a hacker could then potentially move beyond the video system.
""Due to the vulnerability in Cisco's surveillance system, any user who has or can gain access to one video camera could potentially gain unauthorized access to the entire network of a federal agency,"" the suit says.
When Cisco failed to act, Glenn spoke with an L.A. airport police detective on an FBI terrorism task force.
The company acknowledged the flaws in 2013 as it released an updated version of the software.
“There's this culture that tends to prioritize profit and reputation over doing what's right,"" Glenn said in a written statement. ""I hope coming forward with my experience causes others in the tech community to think about their ethical mandate."""

(Reuters) - Wearable device maker Fitbit Inc cut its 2019 revenue forecast on Wednesday, blaming disappointing sales of its newly launched cheapest smartwatch Versa Lite, sending its shares tumbling as much as 16% to a record low.
Fitbit in March launched Versa Lite, priced at $160, compared with the $200 the full version sells for. The watch, which can track workouts and heart rate, lack features such as the ability to store music directly.
""While Versa Lite received good present consumer reviews, we saw that consumers were willing to pay more for a smartwatch with additional features or look for discounting versus everyday value,"" Chief Executive Officer James Park said during a post earnings call with analysts. 
The company had moved into the smartwatch market to cushion the hit from slowing growth of its popular colorful fitness trackers, but has faced tough competition from deeper-pocket companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).
Smartwatch revenue decreased 27% year-over-year in the second quarter.
On the call, Chief Financial Officer Ron Kisling also said the company anticipates burning cash in the first three quarters before generating cash in the fourth. 
Fitbit lowered its 2019 revenue forecast to between $1.43 billion and $1.48 billion, compared with its prior expectations of $1.52 billion to $1.58 billion. 
The disappointing performance of Versa Lite suggests the overall health of the business is not as strong as we had thought, DA Davidson analyst Thomas Forte said. 
Versa Lite also weighed on average selling price, which fell 19% to $86 per device and missed Wall Street expectations of $91, according to research firm FactSet. 
Some analysts also pointed to the weak performance of the company's health business - widely seen as a growth driver - that connects users with doctors, hospitals and lifestyle coaches.
Fitbit has been partnering with health insurers and making tuck-in acquisitions in the healthcare market as part of efforts to diversify its revenue stream.
Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese said the 16% growth in the business during the second quarter was underwhelming and investors would want to see more if the segment is the major growth driver for Fitbit.
The business reported a 70% growth in the preceding quarter to post revenue of $30.5 million.
Fitbit estimated revenue of between $335 million and $355 million for the third quarter, below analysts' average estimate of $399.4 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (https://reut.rs/2ynoknd)
The company also forecast an adjusted loss of between 9 cents and 11 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 2 cents per share.
Excluding items, the company lost 14 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30, smaller than estimates of 18 cents loss. 
Revenue rose about 5% to $313.6 million, beating analysts' average estimates of $312 million.

The company's shares have fallen 15.5% this year to Wednesday's close.

(Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Whiting Petroleum (N:WLL) on Wednesday reported a surprise quarterly loss, announced a 33% job cut and asset sales as a lack of natural gas infrastructure hits prices.
Construction of new oil and gas pipelines in the United States has failed to keep pace with output, which has more than doubled over the past three years in the country that is now the world's largest oil producer.
Since gas cannot be stored in tanks or transported by truck or train, any excess has to either burned or re-injected into the ground, burning a hole in producers' pocket.
In the second quarter, average realized prices for oil fell about 2%, while it dropped 64% for natural gas.
Whiting, which expects the infrastructure constraints to continue through the year, said it had cut about 254 positions and expects to save about $50 million in costs annually.
The company said it will take a one-time charge of about $8 million in the third quarter from the restructuring. 
The job cuts come as investors press producers to cut spending and pull back on drilling in favor of share buybacks and dividends. 
Whiting also cut its full-year production forecast to between 45 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and 46.5 million boe, from its prior forecast of 46.7 million boe to 47.7 million boe, as the company agreed to sell $53 million of non-operated properties, producing 703 boe per day.
Production in the reported quarter rose only about 1% to 127,870 boepd, with oil production being hit by about 3,000 barrels per day from the infrastructure constraints. 
Whiting's shares fell 15% after it posted a loss of 28 cents per share, compared to analysts' estimates for a profit of 30 cents. 
Fellow shale producer Concho Resources (N:CXO), also hit by lower crude and natural gas prices, reported profit below analysts' estimates for the third straight quarter on Wednesday.
Concho, which operates in the Delaware and Midland basins, said total production rose 43.5% to 328,681 boepd, while prices fell 12.9% per barrel of oil equivalent.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned 69 cents per share, missing analysts' estimates of 75 cents, and sending shares down 8.4% in extended trading. 

Concho also said it will enter a joint venture with Solaris Water Midstream LLC, where Solaris will manage Concho's produced water gathering, transportation, disposal and recycling for about 1.6 million acres located primarily in Eddy County, New Mexico.

(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc's (O:QCOM) quarterly revenue and profit forecast fell short of Wall Street targets, driven by Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's strong gains in the Chinese smartphone market, the U.S. company said, sending its shares down as much as 6%.
In an interview on Wednesday, Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters Huawei had stolen market share mainly from its domestic rivals such as  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810), Oppo and Vivo, all of which are major Qualcomm customers.
Huawei's advance has spurred other phone makers to cancel 4G models planned for the rest of this year and instead focus on 5G models for release early next year that could drive growth for Qualcomm, he added.
""Huawei was very aggressive in terms of making sure they built their market share there because they couldn't sell things internationally,"" Mollenkopf said. ""And the reaction of the (other Chinese phone makers) was, 'Let's go as fast as we can to 5G, because there's a great opportunity there,' even to the point of saying, 'Let's cancel 4G models.'""
Mollenkopf said Qualcomm will not see benefits from that shift until early 2020 but said 5G rollouts by carriers appeared to be on track, including in China where Huawei is also a major telecommunications gear supplier. KinNgai Chan, an analyst at Summit Insights Group, called Qualcomm's outlook a ""pause in 4G ahead of the transition to 5G.""
Huawei's effect on Qualcomm's forecast underscores the extent to which the Chinese company has become more of a rival than a customer to the San Diego-based company. Huawei, which was the subject of U.S. sales restrictions imposed in May, continues to buy a small number of Qualcomm chips.
But the companies, which are among the world's largest holders of patents related to 5G technology, are in a protracted licensing dispute. Huawei had been making good-faith payments and negotiations have inched forward, but Mollenkopf said no further payments are included in Qualcomm's fiscal fourth quarter guidance.
""The companies are talking and we're focused on a final agreement, but we don't have it yet,"" Mollenkopf said.
Huawei supplies many of its own chips for smartphones, and it grabbed market share from Chinese companies over the past quarter, according to market research firm Canalys. Those companies' higher-end phones, which compete against directly with Huawei's models, tend to use Qualcomm chips.
Mollenkopf said the U.S.-China trade war and a slow smartphone market drove Qualcomm to lower its outlook for 2019 sales of smart devices to a range of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion, down from a previous estimate of 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion. 
Qualcomm collects license fees from smartphone makers for using its patents.
The company's modem chip shipments fell 22% to 156 million in the third quarter, missing analysts' estimate of 160.1 million, according to FactSet.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Qualcomm settled all their litigation in April. Apple signed a six-year patent license deal with Qualcomm, as well as a multi-year chip supply agreement. 
The two have not said when Apple would resume using Qualcomm's chips in iPhones after dropping them in favor of Intel Corp's (O:INTC) chips for 2018 iPhone models.
Apple last week bought Intel's modem business to help supply its own smartphone chips. Mollenkopf told Reuters the company had expected such a deal when negotiating its agreement with the iPhone maker, but Apple's purchase had no effect on Qualcomm's fourth quarter outlook.
""This was something everybody assumed,"" Mollenkopf said. ""And we protected ourselves and feel very good about continuing to be able to compete"" for Apple's business, he added.
Qualcomm forecast total fourth-quarter revenue of $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion and profit of 65 cents and 75 cents per share, below estimates of $5.63 billion and $1.08 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Qualcomm is also seeking to pause the enforcement of a sweeping antitrust decision in a case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The company has said the ruling could upend its licensing talks with handset makers around 5G technology.
Revenue for the third quarter ended June 30 was $4.9 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $5.08 billion. That excluded a one-time payment from Apple for unpaid royalties while the two were in a legal dispute.

Excluding items, Qualcomm earned 80 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 75 cents.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major U.S. banks lowered their benchmark rates for a wide range of consumer and commercial loans on Wednesday, following a rate cut from the Federal Reserve.
Starting on Aug. 1, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) said they will reduce rates by 25 basis points to 5.25%.
The banks use different names, with Citi calling this its ""base rate,"" and JPMorgan and Wells Fargo referring to it as a ""prime rate.""
However, lowering this benchmark rate means lower interest rates on loans that are based off the Fed's main short-term rate. The move could result in lower revenues for the banks in the coming quarters.
Earlier on Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut the overnight lending rate to a target range of 2.00% to 2.25% due to concerns about the global economy and muted U.S. inflation.
The U.S. central bank signaled a readiness to lower borrowing costs further if needed.
Although banks were expected to lower rates in line with the Fed, the moves were notable because rates had been rising for more than a decade.
The last time JPMorgan reduced its prime rate was in December 2008, when it cut the rate to 3.25% from 4%. The bank maintained a 3.25% prime lending rate for the next seven years, eventually raising it to 3.5% in December 2015."

Prudential's U.S. individual life insurance segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $135 million, compared to operating income of $43 million in the year-ago quarter.
Adjusted operating income at its annuity segment fell 9% to $462 million.
An annuity is a long-term insurance contract that allows consumers to generate a steady income during retirement.
PGIM, the company's asset management arm, posted a 4% rise in adjusted operating income to $264 million from a year earlier.
The international insurance business recorded a 8.3% rise in adjusted operating income to $849 million, partly due to growth in Brazil.
Prudential's adjusted operating income rose to $1.31 billion, or $3.14 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.30 billion, or $3.01 per share, a year earlier.
But analysts on average had expected a profit of $3.23 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

PG&E filed the papers to answer an order by U.S. District Judge William Alsup demanding the power provider respond to the article, which reported PG&E did not upgrade parts of its electrical grid that it was aware could spark wildfires.
""PG&E strongly disagrees with the WSJ article's suggestion that PG&E knew of the specific maintenance conditions that caused the Camp Fire and nonetheless deferred work that would have addressed those conditions,"" the company said.
San Francisco-based PG&E said the article's implication that delayed planned maintenance that could have averted November's Camp Fire is based on a misunderstanding of that work on a transmission line and tower.
""The purpose of that work was not to identify and fix worn or broken parts, such as the hook on the transmission tower that failed and caused the Camp Fire to ignite,"" PG&E said.
""Rather, the purpose of that work was to address the clearance between transmission line conductors and from transmission line conductors to the ground,"" PG&E said.
PG&E also said it ""denies the generalized assertion that it repeatedly failed to perform the necessary upgrades to prevent failures on its transmission lines.""
A Wall Street Journal spokesman told Reuters by email the newspaper was reviewing PG&E's court papers. 
Alsup on July 10 demanded PG&E give him a ""fresh, forthright statement owning up to the true extent of the Wall Street Journal report"" published that day.
The article reported PG&E delayed maintenance and improvements on aging power-lines and towers in recent years.
According to the article, PG&E was aware in 2017 it needed to improve maintenance and replace equipment to avoid failures causing fires following a historic drought in California.
A failure of one PG&E power line in November caused the Camp Fire, which killed more than 80 people and destroyed the town of Paradise.

Alsup is overseeing PG&E's probation stemming from its conviction over a deadly 2010 natural gas pipeline explosion. He has been pressing PG&E for answers on its safety measures in response to massive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that forced the company into bankruptcy in January in separate proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 05:01PM ET</span>",Auto suppliers take more pessimistic view of China vehicle production,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Many global auto suppliers are striking an even more pessimistic tone about Chinese vehicle output this year than some research firms, with the suppliers bracing for the pain to be far greater than the single-digit percentage declines predicted by some in the industry.
There have been 12 straight months of falling sales in the world's largest automotive market, and demand in China is expected to decline for the second straight full year.  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) on Wednesday cut its China industry sales outlook by 4%.
China auto sales have been hurt by a slowing economy and a bruising trade dispute with the United States that has hurt consumer confidence.
Exacerbating the industry's pain is the implementation of tougher emissions standards that has automakers slashing vehicle production so they are not stuck with vehicles they may not be able to sell. That has made planning tougher for suppliers, who focus on production figures and see a more severe decline ahead.
""It's an opaque situation,"" Aptiv (N:APTV) Chief Executive Kevin Clark told analysts on Wednesday. Aptiv makes advanced driver safety systems.
Clark questioned whether inventory levels in China are still inflated and said the company has cut jobs there in line with the production declines to keep costs under control. Aptiv is planning for China production to fall 15% in the third quarter and 13% for the year.
""We feel as though we've taken a fairly conservative position and balanced the risk and the opportunities in our current outlook. Is it possible that it could be worse? It is possible. We don't think it's likely,"" he added.
Research firm IHS Markit estimated this month that light vehicle production in China this year would fall 6.9% to 24.76 million vehicles from 26.61 million in 2018.
Clark is not alone in taking a more conservative stance given the declining demand and production. Several CEOs at auto suppliers on their earnings calls this month talked about double-digit declines in output.
 Garrett Motion  (N:GTX) CEO Olivier Rabiller said on Tuesday the company was changing its full-year production forecast for China to a decline of 10% from its prior forecast for an 8% drop. The company reduced its 2019 financial outlook as a result.
""We are a little bit more pessimistic than the consensus of the industry,"" he said.
On July 19,  Gentex Corp  (O:GNTX) Chief Executive Officer Steven Downing said the company made a point of planning more pessimistically for the second quarter than IHS had predicted.
""We did make some manual adjustments to the IHS data, which actually served us pretty well,"" he said. ""We're taking the same approach in the back half of this year.""
BorgWarner Inc (N:BWA), which slightly lowered its 2019 profit forecast, is now planning for a decline in China of 10% to 14% for the year.
""We want to share that realistic outlook,"" CEO Frederic Lissalde said July 25. ""That is our best guess.""
Like several suppliers, BorgWarner talked about outperforming the weak market.
 Visteon  Corp (N:VC) on July 25 said it grew 30% in China in the second quarter and has added $1 billion in new business there year to date. It credited new product launches and upgraded content in vehicle cockpits, including a deal with an unnamed automaker for a next-generation infotainment system.
Visteon Chief Executive Sachin Lawande said growth in China compared with earlier expectations would be ""muted"" and the company now expects industry production for the year to fall 10%, compared with a prior forecast for a 4% decline. Visteon cuts its full-year profit outlook.
 Lear  Corp (N:LEA) said on July 26 that the midpoint of the company's outlook assumed China industry production would fall more than 20%.
Of course, the trade tensions between the United States and China could further upset plans.
Aptiv has reduced the hit from trade tariffs between the countries to $44 million from $75 million previously, and Clark sees that climate as permanent rather than temporary. The company has shifted production from China to South Korea to cut costs as a result."

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 04:28PM ET</span>",U.S. prisons lose Wall Street sell-side coverage,"By Sinéad Carew and Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Sell-side analysts have stopped advising investors on U.S. private prisons as Wall Street has distanced itself from publicly traded GEO Group Inc (N:GEO) and CoreCivic Inc (N:GEO). 
This retreat follows a parade of major lenders announcing they would no longer offer financing to private detention center operators amid a public uproar over immigrant detention policies of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey dropped analyst coverage of the prison companies earlier this month putting the pair in a very small group of big companies with no coverage from Wall Street analysts that sell stock research to investors.
Investors have also been spooked by the sector's risks, with both companies having fallen more than 20% since late June after U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren called for the elimination of privately run Federal and State detention centers, arguing they put profits above safety.
During a quarterly earnings conference call on Tuesday, GEO Chief Financial Officer Brian Evans said the company was working with a number of smaller equity analyst shops and in the early stage of developing relationships after a portfolio manager asked about efforts to get sell-side coverage.
CoreCivic did not respond to requests for comment. 
GEO and CoreCivic are among the roughly 3% of companies without analyst coverage among New York Stock Exchange listed companies with a market capitalizations between $1 billion and $3 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. 
Sell-side analysts typically issue reports setting stock-price targets and recommending whether investors should buy, sell or hold the stocks based on business analysis. 
The lack of reports and recommendations is a negative for both investors and corporations, according to Haran Segram, a clinical professor of finance who teaches classes on valuing companies at NYU Stern Business School. 
""It's bad news from the investor's perspective because no price discovery is happening. Its bad news from the company's perspective because if they're trying to do funding investors will be looking for independent research. If they don't find it they'd be reluctant to fund the company,"" said Segram. 
Suntrust Robinson Humphrey dropped coverage on July 9 a day after parent company SunTrust Banks Inc (N:STI) said it would stop financing prison operators and immigration holding facilities.
A SunTrust spokesman said the coverage change was a ""reallocation of resources"" and not connected to the decision to forego financing work. 
Wells Fargo dropped coverage of the stock on July 15 citing ""diminished institutional interest."" In January Wells Fargo said it was reducing its relationship with the prison industry as part of its ""environmental and social risk management process.""
US Bancorp (N:USB) said this week it has been reducing its exposure to the sector due to risk characteristics and that it plans to exit the relationships once its contractual obligations expire. 
 Barclays  (L:BARC), which said earlier this week that it was cutting ties with the industry, was part of a group of several banks that helped finance a revolving credit line for GEO that is set to expire in 2024.
“We intend to allow this facility to expire in due course and currently do not plan to enter any new financing arrangements with these companies,” a company spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
Other banks that have said they would forego providing financing to private prisons include JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), France's  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP) and Fifth Third (O:FITB).
In April 2018  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which does not have a relationship with either company, ended coverage of the prison stocks. A spokesperson declined to comment.

CoreCivic shares, which closed up 3% on Wednesday, have fallen 28% since June 20 and 4.7% year-to-date. GEO shares, which closed up 4.5% on Wednesday, have fallen about 24% since June 20 and are down 9.3% on the year.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were all off about 1% at 3:15 p.m. ET. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.1%, with only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) showing gains.
At its bottom, the Dow was off 478 points. The Nasdaq was off 164 points. It was the worst loss for the major averages since early July.
The selloff appears prompted by investors' unhappiness with the Fed's explanation of why it cut its federal funds rate to 2% to 2.25% from 2.25% to 2.5%, its first in a decade.
In his news conference after the rate cut announcement, Powell was struggling to explain the need for a rate cut when the domestic economy is performing well. He said he was more worried about business investment, global growth and dealing with rising trade tensions. He confused many traders first by suggesting the cut was a ""one-and-done"" and then said there might be more cuts.
He called the move a mid-cycle policy adjustment."

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Chinese billionaire has been indicted by a grand jury on charges he schemed with the aluminum company he founded to evade $1.8 billion of tariffs by smuggling huge amounts of the metal into the United States, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday.
Liu Zhongtian, 55, and China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd (HK:1333), where he served as chairman and president, were among several defendants charged in a 24-count indictment by the Los Angeles grand jury.
The May 7 indictment had been kept under seal until late Tuesday. It came as U.S. and Chinese negotiators resumed talks to end trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.
 China Zhongwan  did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours.
Liu is believed to be in China, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, and an arrest warrant has been drawn up, according to The Wall Street Journal. It was unclear whether Liu has a U.S.-based lawyer. Liu and his family are worth $3.2 billion, Forbes magazine said.
Prosecutors said the alleged scheme began as early as 2008, and eventually involved efforts to escape duties imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2011 on various types of extruded aluminum imported from China.
The indictment said companies affiliated with Liu went through ports in the Los Angeles area to import aluminum extrusions that were ""tack-welded"" together, to appear as finished ""pallets"" that were not subject to duties.
Prosecutors said Liu would then stockpile the aluminum at four southern California warehouses, and with his associates orchestrate bogus sales to companies he controlled to inflate China Zhongwang's financials and make it appear more valuable.
Liu, also known as ""Big Boss"" and ""Uncle Liu"" according to the indictment, was also accused by prosecutors of running a ""massive"" money laundering operation involving the use of shell companies to transfer funds to China Zhongwang.
U.S. authorities said the scheme gave Liu's companies an unfair advantage over American rivals and posed other hazards.
""Our national security is jeopardized when domestic industry loses its ability to develop and supply products for U.S. defense and critical infrastructure applications, forcing us to become dependent on unreliable imports,"" Joseph Macias, special agent in charge for homeland security investigations in Los Angeles, said in a statement.
Liu and several other defendants face charges of wire fraud, money laundering, passing fraudulent papers through a customhouse and conspiracy.
Most counts carry a maximum 20-year prison term, and if served consecutively carry a maximum 465-year term.

The case is U.S. v Liu et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 19-cr-00282.

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 03:56PM ET</span>",Carlyle to give shareholders a vote in switch to corporation,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) -  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) emulated its peers on Wednesday with plans to convert from a publicly traded partnership into a corporation, and went one step further by announcing it will become the first U.S. private equity firm to hold shareholder votes.
The corporate governance changes will have limited impact on how the Washington, D.C.-based firm runs its affairs, given that it will continue to be controlled by its founders and employees for the foreseeable future. Insiders own 66% of Carlyle, and the vast majority of them have committed to voting their shares as a block for up to five years, the firm said.
Nonetheless, holding annual meetings for shareholders to cast votes represents a significant milestone in the evolution of the secretive, tightly knit private equity industry.
The move could end up boosting Carlyle's valuation, because it will allow its inclusion in indices that exclude publicly traded partnerships. Carlyle may also be included in more indices than its peers, such as the Russell and the S&P, because it will be the first publicly traded private equity firm to abolish its dual-class shares.
Earlier this month, Blackstone President Jonathan Gray said his firm does not plan to convert its dual-class share structure into one common class stock.
""We are going to stick with our governance strategy and work hopefully to convince these indices it makes sense to include us,"" Gray told analysts on a conference call on July 18.
Private equity firms pay corporate taxes under the partnership structure on the management fees charged to investors, but are mostly shielded from paying these taxes on performance fees.
Under the so-called C-Corp structure, Carlyle will pay corporate taxes on all its revenue, in exchange for enabling investors such as mutual funds and index trackers to buy the stock.
The additional tax burden has become less severe after the headline U.S. corporate tax rate was lowered effective last year to 21% from 35%. Carlyle's peers Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX), KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) and Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) have already opted to switch to a C-Corp.
""(The change) improves our trading liquidity, makes us more attractive to new investors, provides a fixed dividend that enables improved capital allocation and offers an attractive yield, and enhances shareholder alignment under a new one-share/one vote governance model,"" Carlyle Co-CEOs Kewsong Lee and Glenn Youngkin said in a statement.
Carlyle said its effective cash tax rate on its distributable earnings was expected to be in the single-digit percentage range in 2020, and then increase to the mid-to-high teens before reaching the low 20s in five years.
Under the new structure, Carlyle's founders, David Rubenstein, Bill Conway and Dan D'Aniello, will each have the right to nominate a subset of the firm's directors, subject to approval by a full shareholder vote.
EARNINGS BEAT ESTIMATES
Carlyle also said its second-quarter pretax distributable earnings – the cash available for paying dividends – totaled $213.4 million, up from $114.5 million a year earlier.
The buyout firm said post-tax distributable earnings per share rose to 57 cents, from 29 cents posted a year earlier, beating the average analyst forecast of 37 cents, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.
Part of the gains were driven by the reversal of a legal setback. In February 2018, the Paris administrative court of appeals overturned a lower court ruling that forced a Carlyle subsidiary into paying $130 million in taxes on the 2007 sale of the ""Imprimerie Nationale,"" the official headquarters of the French printing works, back to the French state for $466 million (375 million euros).
Carlyle said on Wednesday it received a $72 million gain because of the ""final resolution"" of the tax dispute.
Carlyle said its private equity funds appreciated 1% in the quarter, compared with a 0.7% appreciation for Blackstone's private equity portfolio and 6.4% appreciation for KKR's private equity portfolio.
Under generally accepted accounting principles, Carlyle reported net income per share on a diluted basis of $1.23 for the quarter, up 120% from a year earlier. That outperformed Blackstone and KKR, which recorded a 59% and 25% drop respectively.
Carlyle declared a quarterly dividend of 43 cents per share. It said it would introduce a fixed annual dividend of $1 per share, paid quarterly."
1085,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 03:11PM ET</span>",Swiss president sees no quick progress in EU treaty row,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss President Ueli Maurer played down prospects for quickly ending a standoff with the European Union over a stalled partnership treaty that has disrupted cross-border stock trading and strained ties with Switzerland's main trading partner.
Maurer, a member of the right-wing and EU-skeptical Swiss People's Party, suggested no deal was likely before the current European Commission's term expires at the end of October.
""In my view it's not enough (time),"" he told broadcaster SRF in an interview aired on Wednesday.
""It does not matter whether it is the autumn or next spring. We have time and we also need time so that we really have something that we can explain, we understand and that serves (the interests of) Switzerland,"" he said.
Brussels blocked EU-based investors from trading on Swiss bourses from July 1 as the row escalated over the treaty, which would see non-EU member Switzerland routinely adopt EU single market rules. The Swiss retaliated by banning EU venues from hosting Swiss stock trading.
Swiss stock volumes have soared this month to their highest in years as the ban forced market participants onto the domestic exchange.
The fall-out from the dispute is being closely watched in Britain as a test case for how EU shares may be traded in London after the country leaves the bloc.
If no Swiss-EU treaty deal emerges while Jean-Claude Juncker is still Commission president, Maurer may end up dealing with designated Commission President and former German defense minister Ursula von der Leyen. She knows Maurer from his days as Swiss defense minister before he took over the finance ministry.
But Maurer, who holds the revolving Swiss presidency this year, dismissed suggestions that his ties to his former German counterpart could help break the logjam.
""Negotiations will not be any easier, personally it may loosen up a bit,"" he said.
Maurer's pessimism adds to the impression that the political impasse is unlikely to break soon.
In Bern, resistance to the treaty -- Switzerland's top foreign policy issue by far -- ranges from the normally pro-Europe center left to the stridently anti-EU far right, which both see the danger of the pact's infringing Swiss sovereignty."

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>",Explainer: What do you do after a data breach?,"(Reuters) - A hacker has stolen the personal information of over 100 million people from  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF), the company said this week, in the latest high-profile breach of sensitive consumer data.
Security experts say data breaches will continue to happen as cyber criminals and state-backed hackers target the protected information held by companies and government agencies.
Such attacks leave consumers vulnerable to fraud and identity theft. Here are some steps you can take to assess the severity of the breach and better secure yourself: 
WHAT WAS COMPROMISED? 
Breaches often cover a wide range of data. Information which is already publicly available, such as your name or email address, is seen as less of a concern. 
Other details, however, can be extremely sensitive and need to remain private. For example, full credit card numbers, which could be used to make fraudulent purchases in your name, or passwords for your online accounts.
Even if stolen, the data may still be protected by encryption. Hacks by foreign governments are also usually seen as less dangerous for general consumers compared to data thefts by financially-motivated criminal gangs because most spy agencies do not sell or trade such information. 
Much of the information stolen from Capital One was already public, including names and addresses of over 100 million people in the United States and Canada. But the breach also included 140,000 Social Security numbers which could be used to steal people's identities.
To assess the severity of the breach, try and determine what information was compromised and in what format it was stolen.
AM I AFFECTED?
Try to establish if your data is likely to have been compromised in the breach. Are you a customer of the affected company? Do you know what data they hold on you? Does the breach only concern data collected in a specific time period?
Answering those questions will allow you to judge the level of risk, but remember some organizations may hold your data without you being aware. Those include credit-reporting companies such as  Equifax Inc  (N:EFX), which suffered a breach in 2017 that affected 147 million people.
Breached companies are usually obliged to notify the people who are impacted, but this does not always happen immediately. Affected companies will typically post guidance for consumers on their own websites about data breaches. 
Under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies have to inform victims of severe data breaches ""without undue delay."" They must then describe in ""clear and plain language"" the nature of the breach, the likely consequences and what measures being taken to deal with it.
IS THIS A SCAM?
If you think you data was compromised, be on high alert for scams and fraud. 
Watch your bank account balances and payment card statements carefully, especially if you believe your financial information has been compromised. If you spot any unusual activity, contact your bank or card provider immediately and inform the appropriate law enforcement agency.
Be aware of so-called ""phishing"" websites purporting to offer information about the breach, or even compensation, but actually set up by criminals to try and trick you into revealing more personal details or making a payment to the wrong account. 
Fraudsters may also contact you directly, by phone or email, and could now be armed with large amounts of detailed personal information which will make them harder to spot. If you're unsure about someone's identity, find the affected company's contact information and contact them independently.

Experts recommend changing passwords frequently and using a combination of letters, characters and symbols to maintain a complex passphrase that is less likely to be guessed.

The company reported earnings of $1.52 a share on revenue of $2.95 billion, missing consensus estimates compiled by Investing.com for earnings of $1.67 a share on revenue of $3.03 billion.
 Molson Coors  (NYSE:TAP) shares fell more than 8% and are off about 25% from their 52-week high, reached in August 2018. The shares are off 52% since peaking at $111.25 in October 2016.
The earnings miss comes as the company sold less volume of beer on falling demand, blaming bad weather and a weak industry backdrop.
Worldwide brand volume decreased 5.6% to 24.3 million hectoliters in the quarter from a year earlier, with broad-based declines seen across geographies, including the United States, Canada, Europe and other international markets such as South America.
""May and June were challenging reflecting unfavorable weather and weak industry demand across our major geographies, resulting in a disappointing volume performance in the quarter,"" Hunter said in a statement.
Its Coors Light and Miller Lite brands offered some reason to cheer, however, with a strong showing during the quarter ahead of the ramp-up in marketing efforts.
""We also saw strong premium light share growth in the U.S. as Miller Lite and Coors Light each gained segment share,"" Hunter added.
Hunter will retire on Sept. 27, and Gavin Hattersley, the leader of the company's U.S. business, will become CEO the next day."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors retreated from the U.S. stock market last week despite the benchmark S&P 500 reaching new record highs, pulling nearly $9.1 billion from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold domestic stocks, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute.
The move away from the U.S. market came on the heels of $1.1 billon in inflows the week before, continuing a pattern in which the outsized gains in S&P 500 have been unable to attract investors en masse. The benchmark index is up more than 20% for the year to date, thanks in part to expectations of at least one equity-friendly interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year. Over the same time, investors have pulled nearly $67 billion out of domestic stock funds.
Instead, investors continued to pile into fixed income by sending $10.4 billion into taxable and municipal bond funds, extending a streak of positive inflows over every full week of the year that has brought more than $255 billion into the category.
World stock funds, meanwhile, continued a 9-week losing streak by dropping slightly more than $1 billion in assets. Investors have pulled approximately $20.5 billion from the category since the start of the year."

1106,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 12:31PM ET</span>",Fed rate cuts could help cheap U.S. small-cap stocks gain favor,"By April Joyner and Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of smaller U.S. companies have gotten cheap over the past year, significantly lagging their large-cap counterparts, and could be poised for a turnaround following a highly anticipated interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve.
Worries about a slowdown in economic growth have soured investor sentiment toward small-cap companies, which are more domestically focused than large-cap multinationals. Profits for small-cap companies have also been squeezed by higher input costs as a result of the U.S.-China trade war, so the group is more vulnerable to an aging business cycle.
Over the past 12 months, the Russell 2000 (RUT) index of small cap shares has fallen 4.3% and the S&P 600 small cap index (SPCY) has fallen 6.9% while the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) has gained 7.1%.
So far in 2019, the Russell 2000 and the S&P 600 have risen, but at a slower rate than the S&P 500. Unlike the S&P 500, neither small-cap index has made new highs this year.
Small-cap stocks have yet to fully rebound from December's equity sell-off that followed the Fed's interest-rate hike that month amid global growth concerns. Investors see rising interest rates as especially costly to smaller companies that tend to receive financing through adjustable-rate bank loans instead of the fixed-rate debt financing that larger companies can access through capital markets.
(GRAPHIC - Lagging small caps: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ysJakV)
Indebted small-cap companies would benefit from the Fed's widely expected interest-rate cut on Wednesday, its first in more than a decade. Some 79% of traders expect a 25-basis-point cut and nearly 21% expect 50 basis points, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
""One of the concerns people had with small (caps) was that their balance sheets are in much worse shape, but the Fed fixes that by lowering rates,"" said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York.
Slumping shares have hit small-cap valuations significantly. The shares usually trade at a higher multiple than large-cap shares because of growth prospects, but the 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 600, at 17.1, has slid below the 17.4 for the S&P 500, Refinitiv data showed.
Coupled with lower interest rates, small caps' relative cheapness could tip the balance in their favor over the next few months, some investors said.
""Small caps will have their day in the sun,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. ""They're actually cheaper"" than large-cap stocks, ""which is very unusual.""
(GRAPHIC - Small caps getting cheaper: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Mqa9ps)
Profits of smaller companies have also lagged, and lower interest rates would bolster earnings by cutting the cost of servicing debt. Estimates show small-cap earnings are close to a trough, which could signal a coming upturn in share prices, said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.
""The earnings for small caps relative to large caps have now stabilized,"" he said. ""The downturn momentum has subsided.""
Refinitiv data shows earnings for the S&P 600 are expected to shrink 8.6% year-over-year for the second quarter of 2019 but edge up 1.6% in the third quarter and jump 19.4% in the fourth quarter.
To be sure, small caps have often underperformed large caps when the Federal Reserve has cut rates in non-recessionary periods, according to analysis from LPL Financial and Ned Davis Research. Analysis from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) also gives a mixed picture of small-cap performance following Fed rate cuts, said Jill Carey Hall, a U.S. equity strategist for the bank in New York.
""Small caps have thrived on access to cheap capital, but overall when we look at...those initial rate cuts, it hasn't necessarily been more beneficial for small caps' performance,"" she said.
Even so, in a recent note, Carey Hall identified investment opportunities in selected growth-oriented small-cap stocks with relatively low valuations, such as  Party City Holdco Inc  (N:PRTY) and  Asbury Automotive Group Inc  (N:ABG).
In particular, cyclical sectors such as industrials and materials contain bargain-priced small-cap shares that look poised to rebound, said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital in Dallas.
""There's room for stocks like that to get reevaluated,"" he said."

""Following similar moves by a number of other banks here in Switzerland, we confirm that we've decided to adjust cash deposit fees for Swiss francs held in Switzerland,"" the bank said, confirming a report by the Financial Times.

Last month the Swiss National Bank kept the negative rate it charges on commercial banks' sight deposits at -0.75%, while the European Central Bank deposit rate is -0.4%. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday.

Revenue in the oilfield services segment, which constitutes a majority of the company's operations, rose 14% to $3.26 billion in the second quarter, led by growth in the Middle East, North Sea and Europe.
Last week, bigger rivals Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co also posted higher quarterly revenue from regions outside North America, benefiting from an uptick in demand from international markets that helped make up for lower sales to U.S. producers reluctant to spend.
On a post-earnings call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Brian Worell said the company's outlook for 2019 was unchanged as a substantial number of equipment orders being booked in its turbomachinery and process solutions (TPS) business do not start taking revenue until the second half of 2019.
Orders in the TPS business surged 34% in the second quarter on increasing activity in the market for liquefied natural gas projects.
According to projections by the International Energy Agency, with global LNG demand expected to grow about 4% a year through 2024, developers could make final investment decisions (FID) later this year to add more export capacity.

MADRID (Reuters) - The chief executive of Spain's BBVA said on Wednesday the bank was reinforcing internal compliance controls and was treating an alleged spying case ""very seriously"" although he said the issue had not had an impact on the bank's business.
Spain's High Court placed the country's second-largest bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) under formal investigation on Monday as part of a probe into the case that dates back to 2004, the court said in a statement.
The court decision followed a request by the anti-corruption public prosecutor last week. BBVA will be investigated on charges of bribery, disclosure of secrets and corruption in relation to the bank's alleged dealings with former police chief Jose Manuel Villarejo. 
""We have not identified any relevant direct impact caused by that situation related to our business or our stock performance,"" CEO Onur Genc told a news conference, although he said the bank was aware of the damage to its public image.
He said BBVA took the case ""very seriously"", adding that the probe was at an early stage. He said he did not see a need for now to set aside any provisions related to the issue.
The chief executive also said the case could have an ""impact on the long-term thinking of different stakeholders of the bank ... and obviously it has an implication on the thinking of our colleagues and of our customers and so on.""
BBVA shares reversed early gains and dropped 1.3% in afternoon trading after the comments. 
Genc said the bank's internal investigation could now follow new lines. ""We are going to do what we need to do,"" Genc said.
The inquiry is related to contracts with the jailed ex-police chief Villarejo, whom news websites El Confidencial and Moncloa.com said the bank had hired to spy on top executives of a potential buyer, construction company Sacyr, in 2004 when Gonzalez was BBVA's executive chairman.
The bank acknowledged it hired Grupo Cenyt, a security firm owned by Villarejo, but said it had found no evidence of spying.
Genc said the bank had strengthened its internal processes to improve governance. ""We'll continue to do so,"" he added.
The bank said on Tuesday it had appointed Ana Fernandez Manrique to replace Eduardo Arbizu as global head of regulation and internal control. It declined to say if this was related to the case.
Genc, who spent much of the results news conference answering questions about the case, reiterated the bank's ""firm commitment to clarifying the facts and complying with the law"".
He declined to name any executives being investigated.

The investigating judge, Manuel Garcia-Castellon, expanded his investigation in early July to eight former BBVA employees. None belong to the bank's current board.

If the gains hold, Apple would be within touching distance of again topping $1 trillion in market value, just shy of the world's most valuable company,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT). Apple had 4.53 billion shares outstanding at the end of last quarter.
In the earnings report after markets closed on Tuesday, Apple said services revenue rose 12.6% to $11.5 billion in the three months to June, offsetting a 12% fall in global iPhone sales to just under $26 billion.
""We were especially pleased with the double-digit increase in Services driven by strong growth from the App Store in China,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook told a conference call after the results.
JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, who rates the stock 'Overweight', said he believed Apple's transformation of the services business and a strong product cycle are strong reasons to own its shares. 
At least 11 of the 43 brokerages who rate Apple shares raised their price targets for the stock, with  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) raising it by $45 to $250. The median of current recommendations is $217. 
""We're encouraged as Apple continues to recover from a difficult start to the fiscal year,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote in a note. However, they said iPhone remains a sustained drag heading into a more incremental fall launch cycle. 
In mainland China, Cook said the overall number of Apple device users had grown in the fiscal third quarter, driving a more a rise in services sales by the company in the world's second largest economy.
Concerns about a slowdown in China, where iPhone sales continue to decline, have helped keep Apple's share price below last year's highs. But it is still up 50% in value from lows hit in a market sell-off at the end of last year.

""If there is a China slowdown, clearly no one told Tim about it,"" Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note.

LONDON (Reuters) - Some trading and investment firms are calling for competition regulators to scrutinize London Stock Exchange's (L:LSE) proposed $27 billion takeover of financial information provider Refinitiv to prevent further market data price hikes.
Asset managers have been pressing regulators in the European Union and the United States to help cut the cost of the financial market data which they buy from exchanges and rely on to make investment and trading decisions.
While few of the investors Reuters spoke to expect market data pricing to prove a dealbreaker, they said it should be scrutinized and regulators could push LSE to provide undertakings about pricing and accessibility of some products.
The European Commission, which declined to comment, is expected to undertake a full review if the LSE's proposed transaction goes ahead, with data a likely focus, sources close to the proposed deal have told Reuters.
""There is cause for some concern for investors as access to LSE's data could become more costly and less accessible outside of the confines of Refinitiv's products,"" Jordan Hauer, chief executive at Amass Insights, a U.S. based platform that matches data providers with investors, said. 
LSE had no comment on anti-trust issues, while Refinitiv's two largest shareholders, private equity group Blackstone (N:BX) and Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI), which owns Reuters News, declined to comment.
While LSE-Refinitiv would form a bigger non-exchange data player, it would still lag market leader Bloomberg LP, Douglas Taylor, managing director of consultants Burton-Taylor, said.
LSE data is mainly proprietary index-related or transactions like stock trades, while that sold by Refinitiv is based on sources like financial institutions and databases, he added.
  Joe Wald, chief executive of independent agency broker dealer Clearpool, said market data costs were already ""excessively high"" and in his experience were growing at an ""abnormal rate"" compared to other market products.
""A key point will be, how transparent [LSE-Refinitiv] are in the pricing of the data and ensuring that access to the data is fair and equitable in order to not disadvantage one market participant over the other,"" Wald said.
Market data charges have become more complex and fund industry representatives say prices have risen and become more opaque.
""In the quest for greater market data revenue, exchanges have unbundled products and charged higher fees for the 'new' products,"" five organizations representing investors in Britain, Germany and the United States said in a letter to EU regulators last December, without giving specific figures.
""The rising cost of market data is of concern to the Investment Association and its members, as investment managers are required to buy this data in order to trade and by regulation,"" Galina Dimitrova, Director for Capital Markets at the British trade body told Reuters.
But industry body the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) in March said its members had combined market data revenues of 245 million euros in 2018, which had risen by only 1% annually in recent years in real terms.
Although some data providers and consumers say the recent arrival of new entrants is putting downward pressure on costs, last year the share of exchanges' revenues from market data was relatively stable at around 30%, the FESE report showed.
'OPENNESS'
Three market participants said combining Refinitiv and LSE could actually lead to improved packages for customers, while sources close to the planned LSE deal said the London exchange has a track record of rewarding customers, such as through profit-sharing in clearing.
""A philosophy of openness is a core value of both companies and we don't anticipate any of these fears on data restriction to be founded in the actual strategy,"" one source familiar with the deal said. 
""(It) would run counter to everything these firms stand for.""
David Lester, who was LSE's Chief Strategy Officer until 2017 predicted ""market noise"" around data charges, potential conflict of interest on pricing and market structure evolution but saw no insurmountable antitrust issues.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has also been looking more closely at exchange data feeds and pricing, and industry insiders expect this tie-up to attract its attention, although U.S.-based antitrust specialist see few hurdles.
The Justice Department declined to comment.
Several platforms trade the same shares in the EU and under the bloc's securities rules, investment firms must show clients they obtained the best prices.
The European Commission financial services arm wants data feeds that are cheap enough for a ""consolidated"" feed to become available at a reasonable price to make markets more competitive and to prevent a slow-death of smaller fund firms.

These firms say data price inflation is putting their businesses at risk, although the FESE study said that exchanges were not gouging customers with data feed prices.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A leading Indian farmers' organization on Wednesday warned the government against joining a major 16-member Asia-Pacific trade pact that the union fears could spur imports of cheaper produce, undermining its agricultural sector.
A team of top Indian government officials will be in Beijing between Aug. 2 and 3 to negotiate the terms of the China-initiated Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) that has been held up by disputes between Beijing and New Delhi over access to markets and protected lists of goods.
Indian farmers believe that the pact will force India to cut tariffs on farm goods, leading to imports of cheaper products such as dairy into the country where agriculture is still the mainstay for its 1.3 billion people.
""Representatives of all prominent farmers' unions in India have unanimously rejected the RCEP,"" Yudhvir Singh of Bhartiya Kisan Union, or Indian Farmers' Union, which represents millions of farmers across the country, told a news conference.
India's dairy farmers are especially vulnerable, he said, fearing potentially low tariffs on milk and milk products would lead to a glut on the local market and a collapse in prices.
India is the world's biggest milk producer and its dairy industry provides critical revenue to farmers especially during poor crop years. Indian farmers earn more money from the sale of milk than from wheat and rice combined.
About 80 million Indian rural households are engaged in milk production which provides livelihood to poor and small farmers, according to official estimates.
Farmers complained that joining the RCEP would encourage foreign dairy producers like New Zealand's Fonterra (NZ:FCG), the world's biggest dairy exporter, to dump their surplus dairy products in India.
""We have written a letter to the trade minister but so far there is no assurance from the government,"" said Dharmendra Malik, a farm leader from Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state.
Several other industry groups in India such as steel, engineering and auto makers have opposed New Delhi's participation in the RCEP, citing the threat of cheaper imports from China.
Negotiations began in 2012 for RCEP, which envisions the creation of a free trade zone that will encompass 45% of the world's population and more than a third of its gross domestic product, but does not involve the United States."

LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss stock volumes have soared this month to their highest in years as a ban on trading on euro zone platforms forced market participants onto the domestic exchange, upending trade flows in Europe while a row between Brussels and Bern rumbles on.
Investors in the European Union and Switzerland lost direct access to each others' stock exchanges from July 1 as the two sides squabbled over a partnership treaty that has stalled after years of talks.
The fall-out from the dispute is being closely watched in Britain as a test case for how EU shares may be traded in London after the country leaves the European Union.
Total volumes on SIX, the Swiss stock exchange, breached 2.5 billion shares in the 21 trading days to July 30, up 45% from a year ago and the highest for the month of July in at least five years, according to an analysis of Refinitiv data.
That marks an 18% rise from June. On an average daily basis, activity has jumped 6.6% from June and as much as 52% from July last year, according to Reuters analysis of the data.
Final data is likely to show monthly activity amongst the highest of the last year, illustrating how the prolonged row has upset equity trade flows in the first month after the Swiss government blocked trading of Swiss shares on EU exchanges.
The Refinitiv data covers all asset classes, but the bulk of SIX business is in equities.
(GRAPHIC - Swiss volumes 2: https://tmsnrt.rs/2MpMw0e)
A spokesman for SIX said the exchange has seen a roughly 20% jump in turnover, which is measured in Swiss francs, this month compared with June.
Brussels blocked EU-based investors from trading on Swiss bourses as the row escalated over the treaty, which would see non-EU member Switzerland routinely adopt EU single market rules. The Swiss then retaliated by banning EU venues from hosting Swiss stock trading.
There is little sign that the political impasse, which has soured ties with Switzerland's biggest trading partner, will be broken anytime soon.
Other factors may have contributed to the rise in activity this month. The European and U.S. central banks have grown increasingly dovish, the damaging trade row between the United States and China has rumbled on and the second-quarter earnings season kicked off.
But the data suggests disruption so far has been limited, with investors shifting to trade directly on the domestic bourse. The frenzied activity has also defied the normal slowdown seen in the summer months.
""We are satisfied that from a technical perspective it went smoothly and that there is trading going on"", even though activity usually drops in July, the SIX spokesman said.
He said getting a deal with Brussels remains a top priority for the exchange and Switzerland as a financial center.
(GRAPHIC - Swiss volumes jump: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ypbyEP)
An analysis of how trading was carried out shows a pronounced shift to on-exchange trading, known as ""lit exchange"" volume, accounted for most of the jump in overall activity, offsetting a drop in over-the-counter (OTC) trading.

(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset management firm, said on Wednesday it had raised $2 billion for its flagship opportunistic credit fund, Global Credit Opportunities, reflecting investor demand for alternative investments.
The fund will invest in corporate credit assets across geographies and industries, and seek value throughout the credit cycle, according to BlackRock, which had $6.84 trillion in assets under management as of June. 
Global Credit Opportunities’ fundraising builds on BlackRock’s broader push in establishing a global private credit franchise. In addition to opportunistic credit, over the last few years, BlackRock has expanded its private credit capabilities in Asian private credit, special situations, and U.S. and European middle market credit, including the acquisition of Tennenbaum Capital Partners in 2018. 
BlackRock’s Global Credit platform manages $100 billion in total client assets, and seeks to generate income and capital growth by targeting less liquid opportunistic, stressed and special situations investments.
According to BlackRock’s 2019 Global Institutional Rebalancing Survey, 56% of global respondents planned to increase their allocations to private credit. 
“Investors looking for attractive risk-adjusted returns and portfolio diversification are increasingly looking to credit, where scale and expertise can help generate alpha,” said Tim O'Hara, global co-head of credit. 

“Building out our opportunistic credit strategy to take advantage of secular trends and cyclical dislocations in the credit markets is a natural evolution of our platform as we continue to bolster a credit business that can deliver for clients across risk spectrums and market cycles,” he said.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Space rockets and satellites are likely to cost more to insure after the European Vega rocket crash this month, which hit insurers with a record space market loss of 369 million euros ($411.21 million), insurance industry sources say.
The Vega rocket carrying a military observation satellite for the United Arab Emirates veered off course shortly after take-off and crashed.
Prior to the accident, Italian aerospace company Avio Aero (MI:AVI), which built the Vega, said it had a 100% success rate.
The insurance loss for the rocket and satellite represents the largest recorded loss in the space market, satellite analysis firm Seradata said.
Until now, insurance premiums for commercial satellite and rocket accidents have been falling due to strong competition among insurers and improved rocket reliability.
But that could change in the aftermath of the Vega crash, leading to higher costs for space rocket launches.
""Space insurers have suffered two major claims within the past year and the cost of these losses far exceeds the premiums earned in this sector,"" said Nick Brown, group chief executive at insurer Global Aerospace, which is backed by major reinsurers Munich Re and Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa).
""Insurance rates for both launch and in-orbit have been at historically low levels and ... need to increase significantly.""
The Vega loss follows the failure of Maxar Technologies' (N:MAXR) WorldView-4 imaging satellite in January, resulting in a $183 million insurance claim.
Last year, space insurance payouts were $600 million, according to Seradata SpaceTrak data, outpacing premiums of around $450 million.
""Space rates could double as a result of this (Vega) failure combined with poor results last year,"" said one insurer, who said the Vega loss alone was expected to cancel out the whole of 2019 global space premium, with further launch and in-orbit risks still remaining for the year.
There were 114 space launches globally in 2018, according to Avio Aero, builder of the European Vega launcher.
Unlike with most car insurance, cover for satellites or rockets is not compulsory. Only 60% of satellites launched in 2017 were insured, according to insurer  Mapfre  (MC:MAP).
For those who do buy insurance, an all-risk policy covers damage of any kind and there is also liability cover available, in case a rocket hits something belonging to someone else.
Space insurance providers include the specialist Lloyd's of London market and insurance heavyweights AIG (N:AIG), AXA (PA:AXAF) and Allianz (DE:ALVG), as well as reinsurers like Munich Re (DE:MUVGn).
Munich Re said earlier this month it was one of the insurers of the Vega policy. Aon (N:AON) was the broker, two sources told Reuters. Aon declined to comment.
Global Aerospace said it did not insure the Vega launcher.
Prices to insure satellites against damage have fallen by 50% in the past two to three years, one insurer said.
Space insurance premiums have dropped 75% in the past 15 years and 60% in the past 10, said a second insurance source, who expected rates to bounce after the recent losses.
But due to the intense competition in the insurance industry, a rise in premiums is not guaranteed.
David Todd, head of space content at Seradata, said it hinged on whether significant insurance underwriting capacity started to leave the market.
Andreas Berger, a  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) board member in charge of the corporate insurance arm, said on Wednesday that the company would be reducing its exposure to the space industry, as part of an overhaul of the loss-making division.
Space tourism will add a new dimension as space passengers may also want insurance.
U.S. space agency NASA plans to allow private citizens to stay at the International Space Station for month-long getaways at a cost of about $35,000 per night, with the first mission as early as 2020.
British billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic is also competing with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin in the race for space.
Space travel could straddle both the space and aviation insurance sectors.
""The advent of space tourism represents a completely new area of risk for insurers,"" Global Aerospace's Brown said."

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi Binladin Group is seeking a financial adviser for a restructuring of the group's debt, which could range between $20 and $30 billion, sources familiar with the matter said.
The move is the latest in state efforts to restructure the construction giant, in which the Saudi government took a roughly one-third stake from Bin Laden family members that were swept up in an anti-graft campaign that Riyadh launched in late 2017.
The company, which has dominated the construction sector for years, is crucial to the kingdom's plans for tourism and infrastructure projects aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil revenues by 2030.
The Binladin Group has sent a request for proposals to a select group of international advisers over the past few weeks to reorganize the debt of the whole group, said the five sources, speaking anonymously because the matter is private.
Two of the sources said the debt amounted to between $20 and $30 billion.
A Binladin group executive said he could not provide a comment on the matter when approached by Reuters.
The debt restructuring request is likely to be met with concern by Saudi banks bruised by several multi-billion-dollar corporate debt restructurings in recent years in the kingdom, one of the sources said.
Creditors had been expecting the finance ministry to revive Binladin with government loans. They are wary of any sign of a similar outcome to a situation involving another construction giant, Saudi Oger, which required banks to make painful write-offs on their loans after a government effort to save the firm failed.
Binladin, whose official name was changed to Binladin Group Global Holding after the state-led restructuring, is now 36.22% owned by finance ministry subsidiary Istidama and 63.78% by Binladin Company for Development and Commercial Investment, Reuters reported earlier this year.
Only two Bin Laden brothers, Saad and Abdullah, are represented on the new nine-person board, in a break from the family's earlier exclusive control before brothers Bakr, Saleh and Saad were detained under the anti-graft purge that ensnared hundreds of business people and government officials.
Even before 2017, the conglomerate had faced financial challenges because of stalled projects and delayed payments as the sector suffered from a slump in oil prices. The firm was temporarily excluded from new state contracts after a crane accident killed 107 people at Mecca's Grand Mosque in 2015."

(Reuters) -  Spotify Technology  SA's (N:SPOT) lighter-than-expected number of new paid subscribers drove shares as much as 5% lower in trading before the bell, overshadowing revenue, gross margins and user engagement successes in the second quarter.
The reaction to what appeared to be one slight disappointment in an otherwise rosy quarter underscored just how dependent on growth companies like Spotify and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are in preserving market value.
The world's most popular paid music streaming service said premium subscribers rose 30% from a year earlier to 108 million, but missed analysts' expectation of 108.5 million.
""We missed on subs. That's on us,"" Spotify Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek said, referring to subscribers in a shareholders note on Wednesday. He said the company expected to ""make up lost ground before year-end.""
""The issue is that they missed on paid subs, which is probably the most important number for the company,"" said analyst James Cordwell of Atlantic Equities.
Revenue from premium subscribers, which accounted for nearly 90% of its overall revenue, rose to 1.50 billion euros ($1.67 billion) in the second quarter.
Since launching its service more than a decade ago, Spotify has overcome resistance from big record labels and some major music artists to transform how people listen to music and become a global leader in music streaming. 
To fuel its next stage of growth, Spotify launched its service in South Africa, the Middle East and India in recent months even as it continues to price aggressively in the developed world.
It still faces competition from Apple Inc (O:AAPL), which trails Spotify with more than 60 million subscribers as of June.
On a morning conference call with analysts, Ek said Spotify delivered 31% year-over-year subscriber growth, ""which we believe is roughly twice the rate of growth of our next closest competitor.""
Spotify's monthly active users, which included its ad-supported free version, grew 29% to 232 million and beat expectation of 227.7 million users.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",Prosecutors charge former Audi CEO Stadler over his role in emissions scandal,"By Jörn Poltz and Arno Schuetze
MUNICH (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Wednesday they had filed charges against former Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler, who is being investigated over his role in Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) emissions test cheating scandal.
Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to having used illegal engine control software to cheat pollution tests, triggering a global backlash against diesel. The affair has so far cost the German carmaker 30 billion euros ($33.5 billion).
The public prosecutor's office in Munich said Stadler and three other defendants are being charged with fraud, false certification and criminal advertising practices. Stadler has denied any wrongdoing, his lawyer said.
Premium brand Audi only admitted in November 2015 that its 3.0 litre V6 diesel engines were fitted with an auxiliary control device which was deemed illegal in the United States.
Volkswagen and its former managers have faced numerous law suits, and in April prosecutors in the German city of Braunschweig charged former Volkswagen boss Martin Winterkorn with fraud over his role.
The Munich prosecutor said that three of the defendants are accused of having developed engines for Audi, Volkswagen and Porsche cars that used emissions cheat devices. 
""Defendant Stadler is accused of having been aware of the manipulations since the end of September 2015 at the latest, but he did not prevent the sale of affected Audi and VW vehicles thereafter,"" the prosecutor said in a statement.
Stadler was arrested in June 2018 as part of a broader probe into emissions cheating at Audi, which is part of Volkswagen Group, and spent several months in prison.
Volkswagen later terminated Stadler's contract against the backdrop of a criminal investigation into whether he was involved in emissions tests cheating. 
The prosecutors said that his indictment relates to roughly 250,000 Audi branded cars, 112,000 Porsches and 72,000 Volkswagen cars that were sold in the U.S. and Europe.
'PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE' 
The defendants charged by the Munich prosecutor include former Audi and Porsche manager Wolfgang Hatz as well as two engineers, several people familiar with the proceedings said.
Hatz, former research and development chief at Porsche and former head of powertrain development at Audi and parent Volkswagen, spent several months in custody in 2017 and 2018 over his alleged role in the emissions cheating scandal. 
A lawyer for Hatz separately said his client denied any wrongdoing.
The Munich prosecutors on Wednesday declined to identify the defendants, except for Stadler.
Investigations against 23 further suspects continue, the prosecutor's office said. 
The Braunschweig prosecutors had said that Volkswagen's emissions cheating took place between November 2006 and September 2015, and that Winterkorn failed in his duty to inform European and U.S. authorities after it became clear in May 2014 that diesel engines had been manipulated. 
Winterkorn had also neglected to inform customers of, and did not prevent, the continued installation of fraudulent software, the prosecutors have said.
Winterkorn's lawyer has said he cannot comment on the charges because he had been denied access to important case files.
Audi said in a statement on Wednesday that it was in the interest of the company, its shareholders and employees to clarify the issues that led to the diesel crisis.

""Until this has happened, the presumption of innocence must prevail,"" the spokesman said.

1132,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 08:39AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Says Europe Is Different From Japan And in a Good Way,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors often compare Europe with Japan these days but, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., their assets are largely sending very different signals.
While tumbling German bond yields, shrinking demographics and underperforming European financial stocks resemble the situation in Japan, JPMorgan says other indicators -- from equities to debt levels -- place Europe in a more favorable position.
John Normand, JPMorgan’s head of cross-asset fundamental strategy, points out that the euro-area’s expansion and inflation may be weak, but nominal growth and core inflation beat Japan’s deflation. A decade after the European debt crisis, leverage levels in the region’s private sector have stabilized. In contrast, Japanese households and companies spent 20 years from the mid-1990s reducing their debt, fueling what JPMorgan calls a balance-sheet recession.
“Although the Euro area is most-often referred to as having Japanized, this term only fits the region on a few criteria,” said Normand in a note. “Europe’s position looks more favorable than Japan’s did at a similar stages.”
And whereas Europe mainly resembles Japan through its low bond yields, the region’s equities couldn’t be more different as they “never” experienced Japan’s multi-year earnings recession or dramatic price-to-earnings derating, said the strategist.
“Japan’s equity P/E derating has been unique because its pre-crisis overvaluation was so extreme,” said Normand.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index is up 33% in dollar terms over the past 20 years, compared to 12% for the Topix.
Economists and the likes of Pacific Investment Management Co. have warned this year that European markets are spiraling toward their own version of the Japanese slowdown that began two decades ago as the euro area confronts low interest rates, a grim economic outlook, falling volatility and the dissemination of negative bond yields.
JPMorgan’s Normand cautions that while the region has so far managed to escape Japan’s fate, more European indicators could yet turn Japanese due to sluggish growth, the low likelihood of significant fiscal stimulus in nations such as Germany and reduced returns under the European Central Bank’s future quantitative easing."

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) investors will see on Thursday how the Detroit carmaker is weathering declining sales and mounting price pressures in its largest markets when it reports second-quarter earnings.
Slumping industry demand in China, the world's largest auto market, and an escalating price war in the lucrative U.S. pickup truck segment are ratcheting up the pressure on GM. Other automakers, including U.S. rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), offered disappointing forecasts last week.
In April, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said her ""confidence in the year ahead remains strong,"" citing the company's new full-size pickup truck launch and the automaker's ongoing business transformation.
Investor David Kudla, chief investment strategist for Michigan-based Mainstay Capital Management, said GM must ""carefully juggle"" its restructuring with the rollout of its high profit vehicles even as it invests for the industry's future while facing such headwinds as declining global sales.
For the full year, GM has forecast adjusted earnings of $6.50 to $7 a share and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion.
For the second quarter, analysts expect GM to earn $2.08 billion, or $1.44 a share, on revenue of $36.1 billion, according to IBES data provided by Refinitiv.
GM must deliver as much as $10 billion in cash flow in the final three quarters of 2019 to hit its full-year target, amid stagnant U.S. demand and plummeting industry sales in China. It reported a negative cash flow of $3.9 billion in the first quarter.
In April, GM said it would hit its full-year target through strong performance, and annual dividends from China and GM Finance.
In 2018, the Detroit company reported negative cash flow of $3.3 billion in the first quarter, but ended the year at positive $4.4 billion.
Auto sales in China, GM's largest market, are headed for a decline for the second year running after demand contracted for the 12th straight month in June.
In the second quarter, GM's China sales slid 12%, a slight improvement over the 17.5% decline in the first quarter.
GM has laid out plans to introduce around 20 new models or variants of older ones this year, most in the second half. Profit pressure could increase as it launches a series of lower-margin electric vehicles over the next several years.
Last week, Ford posted a lower-than-expected profit and provided investors with a full-year earnings forecast that fell short of analysts' expectations, and luxury carmaker Daimler reduced its 2019 sales outlook for Mercedes-Benz cars.
GM's profits in the lucrative pickup truck market have also been pressured by an escalating price war with Ford and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA). The three Detroit automakers dominate the segment.
GM executives previously said they were ""bullish"" on sales in the segment for the rest of the year, and have cited the introduction of more profitable models as the launch continues.
GM Chief Economist Elaine Buckberg said this month that U.S. industry sales were strong in the first half and should remain so in the second half and get even more support if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as expected.
The company's U.S. inventory of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks at the end of July was 108 and 110 days, respectively, according to Automotive News. In comparison, inventory for the Ford F Series and FCA RAM trucks stood at 88 and 75 days, respectively.
GM no longer discloses monthly sales data and a company spokesman said the Automotive News estimates were incorrect. He added that truck inventories were approaching “optimal levels” and GM tries to maintain about a 100-day supply because of the complexity of truck offerings.
Last week, GM backed off the target for commercial deployment of cars by its Cruise self-driving unit beyond 2019, citing a need for more testing."

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 06:47AM ET</span>",Getting under the hood of Amazon’s auto ambitions,"By Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expanding its transportation prowess to do virtually everything short of building a car. 
While Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has said little publicly about the company's ambitions in the sector, the strategy is aimed at leveraging Amazon's strengths in logistics, cloud computing and digital services together with new interests in related fields from robotics to manufacturing, according to more than two dozen people, including Amazon executives and industry executives familiar with the strategy, and a Reuters analysis of Amazon's patent activity.
With these new investments and alliances up and down the auto supply chain - and by hiring key auto industry veterans and amassing a robust patent portfolio - Amazon is positioning itself to challenge corporate customers and partners ranging from  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) to Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. 
For a graphic on Amazon's transportation ecosystem, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2MlqUSR
Businesses such as Amazon Web Services and Fulfillment by Amazon started as internal efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency in serving consumers, and later expanded to corporate customers. However, companies working closely with Amazon also risk losing business to the online retailer as its transportation expertise grows, according to some analysts and industry insiders.
Corporate customers ""should be very scared"" of Amazon's move into the dashboard, said John Ellis, a transportation consultant and former global technologist at Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. As consumers pay less attention to horsepower and more to streaming content and services, he expects more consumers ""won't really care whether you’re in a Ford or a Chrysler or a Chevrolet or a BMW.""
Ned Curic, a former Toyota Motor Corp executive recruited by Amazon to oversee Alexa Auto in 2017, said in a written response to Reuters that the company is ""always looking for ways to more closely integrate Amazon services if we think it'll bring value to the customer."" 
PATENT PUSH
A Reuters analysis of more than 5,000 patents granted to Amazon from December 2016 through May 2019 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office indicates at least 210 of those patents cover transportation-related topics from drones to automated ground vehicles. The auto-related patent push outpaced tech rivals Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, whose sister company Waymo is a self-driving pioneer.
Amazon was granted several patents that involve the transport of passengers, including a 2017 patent to provide an on-demand transportation service through a network of self-driving vehicles - a potential competitor to Uber,  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Waymo, as well as major auto customers such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Ford and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
Patents do not always evolve into specific businesses and processes, Amazon said. 
""Like many companies, we file a number of forward-looking patent applications that explore the full possibilities of new technology. Patents take multiple years to receive and do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services,"" an Amazon spokesman said in a statement.
The patent push comes with a boost in Amazon's transportation-related investments. Since February, it has joined other major investors in providing nearly $2 billion in funding to three high-profile startups: electric truck maker Rivian Automotive, self-driving systems developer Aurora and food delivery firm Deliveroo.
In the past two years, Amazon has built out its transportation ecosystem further with the acquisition of three startups — Dispatch, Canvas and Tapzo — while investing hundreds of millions of dollars in at least nine others, including Shuttl, an Indian company developing an app to help commuters find seats on buses.
Amazon's business partners in the sector include automotive suppliers such as Aptiv, Panasonic Corp and Nvidia Corp, big transportation providers such as Uber and Avis, and self-driving heavy truck startups Embark and China's TuSimple.
""INDUSTRIAL CLOUD"" 
The company, through its $33 billion Amazon Web Services unit, also is rapidly expanding its business with corporate customers, notably through two major cloud-based initiatives this year with Ford and VW.
The strategic alliance with VW, which includes German supplier  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), aims to create an ""industrial cloud"" to digitally connect the automaker's far-flung manufacturing operations - 122 plants worldwide - and up to 30,000 supplier factories, according to Jonathan Allen, head of professional services in AWS' global automotive practice. 
Volkswagen in March said AWS cloud-based services, including machine learning and data analytics, would help the automaker to ""increase plant efficiency and uptime, improve production flexibility and increase vehicle quality.""
AWS has been one of Amazon's fastest-growing, highest-margin businesses and provides a platform for corporate customers - from BMW and Toyota to Avis and Formula One - to manage, analyze and in some cases monetize data.
Gavin Sherry, CEO of Ford's Autonomic web services subsidiary, said the No. 2 U.S. automaker can learn a lot from Amazon, which is working with Autonomic and Ford to build a cloud-based platform for the transportation industry.
""They have the relationships, credibility and know-how that we will need in order to fulfill our vision,"" he told Reuters.
ALEXA + LOGISTICS
Alexa, Amazon's digital assistant, is taking a leading role in the company's drive to get inside cars.
Amazon is collaborating with a number of automakers to embed Alexa in vehicles, and has made deals with GM, Ford, Volvo and Honda Motor Co Ltd to allow online orders to be delivered to owners' cars. 
""Our goal is to bring Alexa to as many vehicles as possible, either through direct integrations with automakers or through automotive accessories with Alexa built in,"" Curic said.
""We have a lot of work to do,"" Curic added, including ""bringing Alexa to more vehicles and accessories, building new Alexa features for the car and launching our own automotive product, Echo Auto.""
Beyond Alexa Auto, much of Amazon's focus has one clear theme: cutting the cost of transporting packages, mainly through the company's Prime and Prime Air delivery and freight services.
It has strengthened those capabilities with the addition of Amazon delivery vans and cargo planes. Its investments in Rivian, which has designed a flexible electric truck architecture, and Aurora, which is developing a software ""driver"" for autonomous vehicles, point to eventual development of self-driving, electric delivery vehicles, analysts said. 
Amazon, which spent more than $8 billion in shipping costs last quarter, is building out the entire logistics infrastructure through the automation of its warehouses, long-haul truck shipments and last-mile deliveries with Scout robots and aerial drones, according to public records.
Electric vehicles are also now a part of Amazon's strategy for connecting homes to its network. Amazon is supplying home charging systems for Audi's e-tron mid-sized electric SUV - a deal that could be a step toward managing vehicle fleets, said Roland Berger partner Stephan Keese.
DATA PRIVACY
One frequently mentioned concern - common to Amazon, Google and Apple - is the security and privacy of data collected from vehicles and their occupants.
Curic said voice data collected by Alexa from consumers is used by Amazon ""to deliver and improve our services.""
Data gathered through Amazon Web Services ""is absolutely secure and confidential,"" said Curic. ""No customer, including Amazon's Consumer business, has access to any other AWS customer's data.""
Allen told Reuters AWS is working with corporate customers to provide advanced data analytics and build services that could generate revenue from the data and enhance the customer experience. 

""That's going to lead to monetization"" of data by those companies, Allen said.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 06:38AM ET</span>",EssilorLuxottica eyes bigger global retail network with $8 billion deal for GrandVision,"By Matthias Blamont
PARIS (Reuters) - EssilorLuxottica (PA:ESLX) is buying Dutch opticians group GrandVision (AS:GVNV) for up to 7.2 billion euros ($8 billion) in cash to take control of thousands of stores where it sells spectacles and lenses.
The deal marks a new milestone for EssilorLuxottica, which was formed last year from the merger of French lens maker Essilor and Italian eyewear group Luxottica, but which has been hit by disputes over who should run the group.
GrandVision, whose chains include Vision Express in Britain and For Eyes in the United States, would give EssilorLuxottica control of more than 7,000 outlets across the world where it already sells brands including Varilux lenses and Ray-Ban sunglasses. 
But the deal is likely to face intense scrutiny by competition regulators. The European Union only approved the 48-billion-euro merger of Essilor and Luxottica after a long study. 
""EssilorLuxottica is looking here to address all the segments of the market, from glasses with Essilor to spectacles with Luxottica and retail with GrandVision,"" said Gregoire Laverne, a fund manager with Roche Brune Asset Management.
""There are synergies to be expected given the group will be able to push its products through GrandVision stores. But the deal poses a real challenge for EssilorLuxottica which is struggling with governance issues,"" he added.
EssilorLuxottica said it had agreed to buy a 76.72% stake in GrandVision from Dutch investment company HAL NV for 28 euros per share. The price could rise to 28.42 euros if the deal is not closed within a year, and the terms value the whole of GrandVision at up to 7.2 billion euros.
GrandVision's management and supervisory boards support the deal, which will be followed by a public offer for all the outstanding GrandVision shares after completion, EssilorLuxottica said. 
Shares in GrandVision, which were floated at 20 euros apiece in 2015, were up 5.2% to 26.68 euros at 0930 GMT. EssilorLuxottica shares were up 3.5% at 122.40 euros.
COMPETITION CONCERNS?
""With GrandVision we will be able to develop our retail network, finally extended throughout the geographies, and fully enable our multichannel and digital platforms,"" said EssilorLuxottica executive chairman Leonardo Del Vecchio.
In a call with analysts, Essilor chief executive Laurent Vacherot said he expected the transaction to contribute to group earnings per share growth a year after completion.
GrandVision has stores in more than 40 countries across Europe, Asia, North America and Latin America, according to its website, and employs more than 37,000 staff. Its outlets attract more than 150 million customers each year, it says.
EssilorLuxottica's current retail brands include David Clulow opticians, Sunglass Hut and Spectacle Hut. 
At the time of Essilor's merger with Luxottica, rivals and some opticians expressed concern that the combined group might persuade opticians to buy eyewear and lenses as a package, squeezing out smaller players.
EssilorLuxottica announced the GrandVision deal as it reported a rise in second-quarter results and confirmed its 2019 financial targets.

GrandVision also posted higher second-quarter sales year-on-year, although its adjusted profit was flat at constant exchange rates.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Plant-based burger maker Impossible Foods on Wednesday announced a partnership with major meat supplier OSI Group [OSIGP.UL], a longtime producer of patties for fast-food chains, as it ramps up to meet demand from consumers and restaurants including Burger King.
Burger King started offering the Impossible Whopper in April in 59 stores in and around St. Louis, and is expected to launch nationally, which would put the plant-based Whopper on the menu in about 7,000 Burger Kings.
The partnership between the vegan burger maker and one of the biggest meat suppliers comes as young, environmentally conscious consumers are feasting on plant-based patties and sausages.
""We got ourselves into a supply-demand imbalance in which we frankly just did not anticipate the level of demand that came from consumers,"" ​Sheetal Shah, Impossible Foods' senior vice president of product and operations, said.
Shares of rival vegan burger company  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) are up over 700% percent since it went public in May. Beyond Meat earlier this week forecast its revenue would rise over 170% in 2019.
Privately-held OSI, based in Aurora, Illinois, has been supplying McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) for about six decades and has 65 facilities in 17 countries.
Shah said California-based Impossible Foods and OSI will both be investing in OSI facilities to produce the plant-based burger patties and that multiple facilities in the Chicago area will start supplying Burger King and eventually other customers as well. The investment details were not disclosed.
When asked if Impossible would be serving McDonald's too, Shah declined to comment on customers, but said: ""I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to go anywhere and everywhere.""
When it comes to plant-based meat substitutes, ""Its time and place is right now,"" Kevin Scott, senior executive vice president for OSI North America, told Reuters. ""The work that's been done in the sector on our behalf and other manufacturers and companies like Impossible Foods are really narrowing that gap to a point of overall consumer acceptance.""
Just three months after its IPO, Beyond Meat this week said it was raising more funds in a stock offering to expand its manufacturing facilities, which are also stretched by booming demand.
Smelling the sizzling opportunity, major meat packers like chicken producer Perdue Foods and Canadian packaged meat producer  Maple Leaf Foods Inc  (TO:MFI) have also launched vegan meat substitute products."

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 05:46AM ET</span>",Increasingly cautious global funds build cash buffer; cut equities: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - ""More caution"" was the mantra of global fund managers in July, with recommended equity allocations cut to the lowest since early 2017 and suggested cash holdings increased to the highest in five months, a Reuters poll showed.
With no respite from trade tariffs, fund managers remain worried about the global economy despite many major central banks shifting towards policy easing, which has pushed Wall Street stocks to record highs this month.
While falling bond yields have not yet unnerved Wall Street or international stock markets, fund managers recommended a cut in global equity allocations to an average 45.7% of the model global portfolio.
Recommended allocations at the beginning of 2019 to global equities, at an average 48.5%, were the highest in a year but have been cut gradually. July's was the lowest since March 2017.
""Some near-term caution toward stocks is warranted given the strong gains in the first half combined with a slowing global economy, renewed trade tensions and stalled corporate profits growth,"" said Alan Gayle, president of Via Nova Investment Management.
""Moreover the lack of market participation outside of the large-cap S&P 500 highlights the challenge.""
A separate Reuters survey of over 500 economists showed concerns a global economic growth rut is at risk of deepening as trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners were likely to intensify this year.
There is no evidence of a resolution to deep differences between the U.S. and China in their year-long trade war, marked by tit-for-tat tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned China against delaying a deal as a new round of talks got underway in Shanghai.
PESSIMISM
Increasing pessimism was also clear in the July 16-30 Reuters poll of nearly 40 fund managers and chief investment officers in Europe, the United States, Britain and Japan.
Suggested allocations to cash were increased to 6.5% from 6.1% in June. That was below a near four-year high of 7.2% set in February when managers ramped up cash holdings.
But despite widespread expectations most major central banks have started - or will do so soon - on the path of easing, funds cut their recommended bond holdings to 40.9% in July from 41.3% the previous month.
""We increase the allocation to cash and reduce the exposure to fixed-income ... amid the very high expectations from central banks and the very low level of interest rates,"" said Filippo Casagrande, head of investments at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments Partners.
When asked where fund managers saw the most risk, the ongoing trade war was the top pick.
But a majority of respondents expected monetary policy easing to be the biggest opportunity to seek solid returns in equities, at least, provided central banks do not make a sudden shift away from current expectations.
""The markets are currently responding to the tones of central banks, which led by the Federal Reserve are all in a very dovish mood looking to offset the potential slowdown from trade wars,"" said John Husselbee, head of multi-asset at Liontrust in London.
""Any central bank mood swing could spell trouble for markets as well as any signs of faltering or expansion of the trade talks.""
The U.S. Fed was expected to cut interest rates for the first time in a decade, by 25 basis points, on Wednesday amid rising risks from the trade war, according to economists a separate Reuters survey.
Echoing the findings of that survey, the latest poll showed nearly two-thirds of fund managers who answered an additional question on what the best course of action would be said the Fed should deliver a quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday.
But that is largely driven by current pricing in financial markets and the consequences of not delivering rather than a fundamental reason for policy easing.
""We expect the Fed to cut 25 basis points. However, they should hold fire until stresses and strains start to manifest more fully in the economy, thus saving their ammunition,"" said Craig Hoyda, senior quantitative analyst for multi-asset strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""The market, however, will act aggressively should the Fed fail to cut.""

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 05:23AM ET</span>",British hedge fund Man Group posts 5% rise in first-half AUM,"By Lena Masri and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - British hedge fund manager Man Group  said assets rose 5% in the first half of the year, helped by performance in its computer-driven strategies, boosting fee income and sending its shares higher.
Weaker equity investor sentiment prompted clients to withdraw cash from its funds, however, a trend seen at rival money managers including France-based Amundi and UK-based Jupiter Fund Management.
Man Group, the world's largest listed hedge fund, said assets under management at the end of June were $114.4 billion, up from $108.5 billion at the end of December and $112.3 billion at the end of March.
Market gains of $6.8 billion drove the rise in assets, said Man Group, founded as a sugar cooperage and brokerage in 1783, and were partially offset by net outflows of $1.1 billion.
The outflows were broadly in line with the $1 billion expected by analysts, in a company-supplied poll, and compare with $8.3 billion of net inflows in the same period a year earlier.
At 0844 GMT shares in Man Group were trading up 3.5%, among the biggest gainers in the  mid cap index.
The strong performance of some of Man's quantitative strategies and gains in some of its early stage funds helped performance fee income rise to $142 million from $85 million a year earlier.
That more than offset a fall in management fee income from $401 million to $382 million.
That in turn helped adjusted pretax profit rise 3% to $157 million, against expectations of $138 million. That underpinned an interim dividend of 4.7 cents per share, slightly higher than the forecast, compared with 6.4 cents per share a year earlier.
""Stripping out the impact of performance fees, the group’s net income was still 5% ahead of consensus expectations for the half,"" Germany's oldest private bank, Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co KG, said in a note.
Assets and profits were pushed up by the firm's computer-driven funds while other parts of the business had a more mixed performance, said Man Group Chief Executive Luke Ellis. He said clients continued to reduce their equity exposure into the third quarter. 
""We enter the second half of 2019 with good performance fee earning potential,"" he said.
He said that nine out of 10 of Man's 'black-box' AHL strategies were at a so-called ""high water mark"", the highest level at which a fund has ever reached.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) posted its highest quarterly earnings in four years on Wednesday, hailing frugal cost management as paying off in a tough environment.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank raised earnings 45% in the second quarter through June, well beyond expectations, as costs continued to come down half a year after it wrapped up a three-year overhaul.
""Part of our strategy has been to reduce our fixed costs very heavily, and I think we did that at the right time,"" Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam said. 
""Our view from the start was that it's always going to be a stagnant industry, so we had to take our cost down very severely,"" Thiam told Bloomberg TV. 
""We're also lucky because we came out with that new platform just at the time when many others are restructuring, and we're benefiting from that,"" Thiam added.
Credit Suisse shares, which had dropped on Tuesday to their lowest in a month, rose 5% by 0829 GMT, with analysts noting a clear beat in Global Markets, the capital-heavy trading division which the bank downsized during its overhaul, and solid inflows of fresh client money, an indicator of future earnings for private banks.
""We view these as strong results,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note. ""Global Markets has been the main cause of consensus earnings downgrades over the past 18 months, but has now shown signs of recovery for a second consecutive quarter.""
GEOPOLITICAL TWISTS
The Zurich-based lender's revenue remained largely flat during the quarter, with a jump in trading income helping offset a slide in its corporate advisory business. 
The bank nonetheless confirmed its ambitions this year to reach a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of between 10% and 11% - double the 5.5% it hit in 2018 - which it aims to achieve through reduced costs and lower tax rates, and which assumes flat revenue for the year.
Geopolitical twists have created a rocky backdrop for private and investment banks, with transaction levels and client sentiment susceptible to uncertainties ranging from central bank rate cuts to Chinese-U.S. trade relations and Brexit.
Rival UBS (S:UBSG) last week posted a 1% net profit rise as strength in its Swiss business helped offset weakness in wealth management. Tepid trading from wealthy clients saw adjusted profit slide 19% at  Julius Baer  (S:BAER). 
At Credit Suisse a 937 million Swiss franc ($945.5 million) net profit was well ahead of the bank's own consensus for 788 million francs.
Revenues from equity sales and trading rose 3%, with management pointing to further gains in market share. Fixed-income sales and trading revenues rose 11%, both ahead of peers.

The bank gave a mixed outlook, saying it had seen healthy levels of client engagement thus far in the third quarter, but adding market conditions would impact whether that engagement ultimately translated into a pickup in activity.

1151,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 04:50AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Next Joins Zara, H&M in Cracking the Digital Age","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Has the fashion sector cracked the digital age?
You might be forgiven for thinking so.  Next  , often seen as a rough proxy for the sector in the U.K., certainly looks in rude health after a quarterly update that surpassed its own expectations by a long way.
Full-price sales rose by 4% in the second quarter, much better than the small drop it had predicted. That’s despite sales at its physical shops dropping 4.2%. Salvation came – as it almost always the case these days – in the form of online sales, which leaped 12%.
 Next  (LON:NXT) shares were leading the FTSE higher by mid-morning in London. At 4:15 AM ET, they were up 7.8%, while the FTSE was down 0.3%. Other European markets were largely treading water ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision and press conference later Wednesday. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was effectively flat after its steep drop on Tuesday.
Next is one of a growing band of retailers who appear to have cracked the transition to multichannel distribution, moving away from traditional bricks-and-mortar operations. Its bigger fashion rivals,   Inditex   (MC:ITX) (the owner of Zara and Massimo Dutti) and H&M (ST:HMb) have offered variations on the same theme in recent years, H&M suffering particularly acutely from inventory management problems and misjudged commitments to new store openings.
At the depths of their respective falls from grace, Next was down 48% from its all-time high, Inditex was down 39% and H&M was down a whopping 66%. But Next is now at its highest in a year and H&M is testing an 18-month high. Inditex is up 22% from its December low. 
Elsewhere Tuesday, German sportswear company Puma (DE:PUMG) went from strength to strength, rising 6.1% to an all-time high on the back of lucrative deals with soccer clubs Manchester City and European champions Liverpool, as well as its re-entry into the U.S. basketball market. The company raised its guidance for full-year operating profit and sales after a strong second quarter that contrasted starkly with disappointing reports from  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and  Under Armour  (NYSE:UAA) in recent days.
But if Next, H&M and Inditex all owe the revival in their fortunes in some degree to transcending the traditional physical store, this week’s earnings reports have shown that there’s one sector that can’t do that. Shares in  Intu Properties  (LON:INTUP), which owns malls in the U.K. and Spain, fell 22% to their lowest in over 27 years on Tuesday after it reported widening losses in the second quarter. That dragged down rival  Hammerson  (LON:HMSO), which had reported its own tale of woe on Monday and which is now down 18% over the last week. For those whose business is the high street itself, salvation seems as far away as ever."
1152,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 04:36AM ET</span>",European shares steady after trade slide; Fed in focus,"By Susan Mathew and Medha Singh
(Reuters) - European shares steadied on Wednesday, as strong results from lenders  BNP Paribas  and  Credit Suisse  countered a poor report from British bank Lloyds in a market marking time ahead of a keenly-awaited U.S. Federal Reserve decision on interest rates.
European markets racked up their worst day in nearly three months on Tuesday, as stocks globally took a beating from a toughening of President Donald Trump's trade rhetoric against China and Brexit worries hit Irish and UK companies.
After inching lower in early trade, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was flat on the day by 0813 GMT.
In a month dominated by corporate earnings and expectations of monetary easing by both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to help the economy, the STOXX is now only marginally higher for the month.
""It's just position tweaking more than anything else. Definitely a feeling of some risk-on rotation. You've got a combination of both, month end and the Fed this evening,"" Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud Securities.
""Given how much hype there has been around this event (Fed meeting), I would be surprised if people weren't already prepositioned and literally just having to react to the earnings headlines. You'll see volumes drift throughout the day.""
France's largest bank by assets, BNP Paribas (PA:BNPP) rose 3.3% after a strong performance by its corporate and investment banking division buoyed quarterly profits, while Credit Suisse (S:CSGN) reported its highest quarterly earnings in four years, sending shares 4% higher.
Europe's banking index (SX7P) rose 0.4%
Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY), Britain's biggest mortgage lender, dropped 3.9% after posting weaker-than-expected pretax profits, taking London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) down 0.3%, in an otherwise quite market.
The Fed's decision is expected after European market hours at 1800 GMT, with Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to hold a press conference soon after.
A quarter-point cut by the U.S. central bank has been fully priced in by money markets, but investors will be looking at the comments with the decision for signs of how far it could go with further easing this year.
The latest data from Germany offered a rare beam of hope on consumer sentiment in Europe's largest economy. Frankfurt's main DAX index (GDAXI) rose 0.2% after data showed German retail sales rose more than expected in June.
Playing into that, sportswear group Puma (DE:PUMG) gained 7% as it raised its outlook for sales growth and operating profit for 2019. Rival Adidas (DE:ADSGn) advanced 1.2%.
In Paris, the main stocks index (FCHI) was flat, caught between a 4% drop in beauty products maker L'Oreal (PA:OREP) after disappointing quarterly sales growth, and rallies in BNP Paribas, construction group  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) and eyewear maker Essilorluxottica (PA:ESLX).
Vinci rose 3.2% after good results, while EssilorLuxottica (PA:ESLX) jumped 3.2% after saying it would buy Dutch optical retailer GrandVision (AS:GVNV) in a cash transaction that could amount to a total of 7.2 billion euros ($8 billion)."
1153,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 04:14AM ET</span>",Airbus second-quarter profits rise and beat analyst forecasts,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril Altmeyer
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus urged European governments to step up plans for a ""likely"" no-deal Brexit and settle a long-running subsidy dispute with the United States to help limit trade risks for Europe's largest planemaker.
The twin concerns surrounding Airbus's cross-border factory network prompted Chief Executive Guillaume Faury to issue a warning about rising trade tensions even as he unveiled stronger than expected second-quarter profits, driving up Airbus shares.
Airbus builds wings for commercial aircraft in Britain, where new Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to lead the country out of the European Union on Oct. 31 whether he has secured a negotiated departure or not, fuelling speculation in currency markets of a disorderly Brexit.
""It is now obvious that 'no deal' is likely and we want all governments to be prepared for that, which was not the case by end of March,"" Faury told reporters, referring to Britain's originally planned exit date from the EU. 
His comments echo those of Britain's employers' group, which says the EU is less prepared for a no-deal Brexit than Britain.
The European Commission says it has published almost 100 preparedness notices including several on aviation and overseen dozens of other legal steps to be ready for a no-deal Brexit.
Airbus has built a stockpile of about one month's supply of aircraft parts as a buffer to cope with Britain leaving the EU without a transitional deal, Faury said. That contributed to a heavy drain on cash in the first half of the year.
Plane parts are exempt from default World Trade Organization (WTO) tariffs under a 1980 pact signed by both the EU and Britain in its own right. But Airbus is worried extra red tape could slow supply chains and hamper the movement of engineers.
Faury also sounded a broader alarm about rising global tensions and in particular recent U.S. threats to impose sanctions on European planes and other goods following WTO rulings against European government subsidies to Airbus.
The French CEO called for a settlement in the long-running dispute, while Airbus included a warning in its results for the first time of damage to deliveries and finances if the punitive tariffs go ahead. The EU is gearing up to impose counter-tariffs after the WTO ruled separately against U.S. subsidies to Boeing (NYSE:BA).
""It’s important that there is a resolution at a given point, a settlement before tariffs are applied,"" Faury said.
""We see the trade wars around the world growing and we don't believe this is something ... industry can benefit from and citizens can benefit from,"" he said.
PROFIT BEAT
Europe's largest aerospace group said second-quarter adjusted operating profit rose 72% to 1.98 billion euros ($2.2 billion), led by strong demand for jetliners. Revenues rose 23% to 18.32 billion euros.
Analysts were on average forecasting adjusted quarterly operating income of 1.77 billion euros on revenues of 17.82 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus.
Shares in Airbus opened up 1.2% against a flat market.
Airbus is trying to overcome industrial delays at a newly expanded plant in Hamburg, Germany, which has been struggling with enhanced cabins for the in-demand A321neo single-aisle.
Airbus kept annual delivery and financial targets, but said it was studying how to increase the share of the A321neo within the wider A320neo family, with more details expected in months.
Airbus is nonetheless on course to be the world's largest planemaker in 2019 as U.S. rival Boeing faces a longer-than-expected grounding of its 737 MAX, ordered by worldwide regulators in March in the wake of two fatal accidents.
Boeing last week posted its largest-ever quarterly loss due to the crisis.
Airbus took 75 million euros in new charges in the second quarter related to the cost of winding down its A380 superjumbo program after deciding to scrap output due to weak demand.
Air France-KLM on Tuesday announced plans to retire the world's largest jetliner to concentrate on smaller models like the A350, which Airbus said was on track to break even this year after progress in curbing costs.
Airbus took 90 million euros in other charges including compliance costs as it pursues a four-year-old investigation into the use of middlemen in aircraft and other sales. 
People familiar with the matter have said Airbus hopes to submit the results of its own internal probe to UK and French investigators around the end of the year - a step toward what it hopes will result in a fine rather than criminal charges.
Faury declined detailed to comment on the probe.

""It’s going in the right direction, it’s progressing, but I’m unable to tell you when it will come to an end,"" he said.

The plan culminated in an autumn 2018 stock market flotation.
But its share price has since fallen by more than two-thirds from 19 pounds ($23.00) in October to below 6 pounds, hit by a weakening performance in Europe, Middle East and Africa, where demand fell by nearly a fifth in the first six months of the year. 
On Wednesday, it posted a pretax loss of 78.8 million pounds ($96 million) compared with a 20.8 million pound profit in the first half of 2018. 
""We are disappointed that our projections for wholesales have fallen short or our original targets, impacted by weakness in two of our key markets as well as continued macro-economic uncertainty,"" Palmer said. 
Overall wholesale demand grew by 6 percent in the first six months as the group posted strong increases in the Americas and Asia, but the slump in Britain and the rest of the region prompted the carmaker to cut its full-year forecast.
Aston has also been hit by expansion costs as it builds a new factory to make its first sport utility vehicle, and a lower average selling price.

The global car sector has been hit by weakening demand in China and a slump in demand for diesel vehicles in Europe, as well as the cost of electrification.

LONDON (Reuters) - British wealth manager St. James's Place said on Wednesday that weaker client sentiment weighed on inflows of new money in the first half of the year while costs rose, leading it to miss forecasts for operating profit.
Net inflows of client cash were 4.4 billion pounds ($5.35 billion) in the six months to end-June, lagging the previous year's 5.2 billion pounds and just missing the 4.5 billion flagged in a company supplied consensus forecast of 17 analysts.
The bulk of SJP's clients are based in Britain where stocks have been hit hard by uncertainty around the country's exit from the European Union, adding to global concerns around world trade.
""In the short term as the current external environment remains uncertain, confidence toward investing may remain tempered,"" Chief Executive Andrew Croft said in a statement.
Higher investments in areas including the company's training program for advisers and its Asian operations, meant profits lagged forecasts.
Operating profit on a European Embedded Value basis, a key measure of financial performance that reflects future expected cash-flows from insurance products, was 465.7 million pounds, down from 489.6 million in the prior year and lagging analysts' forecast of 480.2 million pounds."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Wednesday to a six-week trough, rattled by fresh trade war concerns following threats from President Donald Trump to Beijing, while increasing worries about a no-deal Brexit kept the pound under pressure.
Later in the day, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The expected easing has supported risk asset prices worldwide.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) pared losses to trade down 0.5% but earlier fell to the lowest since June 19, while Japan's Nikkei (N225) declined by 0.7%.
In early European trade, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) rose 0.1%, German DAX futures (FDXc1) were up 0.1% and Britain's FTSE futures (FFIc1) were little changed.
Major Wall Street stock averages ended slightly lower on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 (SPX) losing 0.26%, after Trump warned China against waiting out his current presidential term before finalizing a trade deal.
As a new round of U.S.-China trade negotiations started in Shanghai, Trump tweeted that, if he wins re-election in November 2020, the outcome could be no agreement or a harsher one.
""We expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points and keep the door open to further rate cuts, which should be sufficient to keep markets satisfied,"" said Mayank Mishra, a macro strategist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank in Singapore.
""U.S.-China trade talks have just started after a long hiatus. I don't think expectations are that high.""
After the closing bell in the United States, Apple shares (O:AAPL) rose 4.2% as its April-June earnings beat estimates and CEO Tim Cook cited ""marked improvement in Greater China"".
In Asia, S&P 500 mini futures (ESc1) rose 0.3%.
The S&P 500 index has risen 2.4% so far this month, bolstered by expectations for Fed easing.
Fed funds rate futures are now fully pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut on Wednesday and another 25 basis point reduction by September.
U.S. consumer spending and prices rose moderately in June, pointing to slower economic growth and benign inflation that cemented expectations of Fed rate cuts.
Trump on Tuesday reiterated his call for the Fed to make a large interest rate cut, saying he was disappointed in the U.S. central bank and that it had put him at a disadvantage by not acting sooner.
In addition to worries about trade talks with the United States, Chinese shares suffered a further setback on Wednesday after the ruling Communist Party's top decision-making body said late on Tuesday it will not use the property market as a form of short-term stimulus.
The blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) fell 0.7%, with a slide in shares of property developers leading a retreat in the broader market.

China will also step up efforts to boost demand, the Politburo said, which takes on more urgency after the country's official PMI on Wednesday showed factory activity shrank for a third straight month due to the trade war.
South Korean stocks (KS11) fell to the lowest since early January on trade war jitters but then trimmed losses to trade down 0.2%. Weak quarterly results from Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) added to concerns about an oversupply of memory chips.
Samsung, closely watched as a barometer of electronics demand, warned that Japanese curbs on the export of chip-making materials are weighing on its outlook and likely to hurt third-quarter results.
In currency markets, the British pound remains near a 28-month low hit the previous day on growing concerns about a disorderly Brexit.
Sterling traded at $1.2148 , not far from $1.2120 marked on Tuesday. It has fallen 4.2% so far this month, on course to log its worst monthly performance since October 2016.
""Trump's comments suggest that U.S.-China trade negotiations are not going well, which is a new negative factor for the markets,"" said Osamu Takashima, head of G10 FX strategy at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Japan in Tokyo.
""In addition to Brexit, markets are starting to price in the Bank of England moving to dovish from hawkish at its next meeting, so this drives sterling depreciation,"" Citigroup's Takashima said.
Other major currencies were less volatile with the yen flat at 108.53 yen to the dollar . The euro stood little changed at $1.1157 (EUR=EBS).
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) gained 0.69% to $58.45 per barrel after earlier reaching a two-week high of $58.53 in Asia."

JOHANNESBURG - Among the metal shacks and narrow side streets of South Africa's townships, one of the country's biggest lenders sees a sizeable market it wants to be first to crack: multi-million-rand businesses operating largely in cash.
FirstRand (J:FSRJ), South Africa's biggest lender by market share, sees enterprises such as Ram Thapa's, a beauty shop and fast-food outlet with combined annual turnover of 19 million rand ($1.36 million) but no business account, as ripe targets for a host of financial products.
Businesses in townships - areas designated for non-whites under apartheid - have largely been ignored by big banks in Johannesburg's financial district Sandton, even though some have tens of millions of revenue a year, said Mike Vacy-Lyle, CEO of business banking at FirstRand's retail unit First National Bank (FNB).
""Four kilometers to the right of Sandton is a township called Alex [Alexandra],"" he said. ""Inside Alex there are massive businesses and business networks that no bank has bothered to open their eyes to.""
FNB has set its sights on the townships as it prepares to defend its No. 1 position from rival Capitec (J:CPIJ) and new digital lenders such as TymeBank and Bank Zero which have shaken up the retail market with cheaper products and are poised to enter business banking.
There are estimated to be up to 5.78 million micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in South Africa according to a 2018 report by the World Bank, and while there is no recent data on the proportion of those firms which have a bank account, a 2010 survey cited in the report estimated it was less than half.
FNB plans to attract unbanked businesses onto its books by first getting them to use fintech firm Selpal. The bank acquired an undisclosed stake in the company late last year. 
Selpal connects local stores with suppliers via software and tablets. Once a customer is using Selpal, FNB will use the data it collects to offer them an account with, for example, an overdraft attached. The bank is launching a business account in October with zero monthly fees though customers will pay as they use a range of transactions. 
In order to succeed, FNB will have to overcome a strong attachment to cash-only transactions, general mistrust of banks, paperwork problems and low margins.
Reflecting that challenge, Vacy-Lyle said it could take up to a decade to sign up at least 600,000 companies. By comparison, it took Capitec five years to add more than 600,000 retail clients.
Rivals including Capitec, as well as Absa (J:ABGJ), Standard Bank (J:SBKJ) and Nedbank (J:NEDJ) - which together with FirstRand make up South Africa's big four - told Reuters they don't have plans to target unbanked township businesses specifically.
In a statement, Gerrie Fourie, chief executive of Capitec, said its plan was to focus on the SME market as a whole. Michael Jordaan, co-founder of Bank Zero, said it would target all businesses.
Luisa Mazinter, chief marketing officer of TymeBank, said its business offering would initially be targeted at sole proprietors and micro businesses, allowing current account-holders to open a separate account for their business with no extra documents required.
In the longer-term, TymeBank will adapt the offering to appeal to both formal and informal enterprises and aim to introduce its own point-of-sale devices, Mazinter said. 
Bongiwe Gangeni, deputy CEO of Absa's retail and business bank, said a number of attempts over the past decade to target unbanked companies, including with loans and point of sale devices, had not generated enough revenue to justify the costs.
She said the issue wasn't always about access. ""I think some of them choose not to be banked.""
FNB declined to quantify the income it is hoping to generate from township companies.
CASH STILL KING
On the face of it, lenders in South Africa are relatively well represented among the general population with more than 80% of adults having access to a current account, according to a 2018 report by FinMark Trust, a Johannesburg-based financial inclusion organization.
But in many communities, cash is still king. A bank account is often a condition of employment or receipt of social payments, and many people withdraw money as soon as they receive it and just use notes and coins.
Only 24% of South Africans make more than three monthly transactions of any kind through their account, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group in 2017.
Some people are wary of formalizing their financial arrangements in case it puts them on the taxman's radar. Many are also mistrustful of digital methods of payment, as well as the financial sector in general after misspelling and corruption scandals, and prefer to pool savings in community-based schemes. 
In his shop, choc-a-bloc with hair and beauty products and mannequin heads wearing wigs, Thapa said he'd prefer to have a business bank account. Right now, he doesn't have access to credit and is relying on a point of sale device linked to his brother's business so he can serve card paying customers.
Cash also attracts trouble, he told Reuters. 
""You know, this area is very dangerous,"" he said, counting the number of times he had been robbed - three - on his fingers.
Bureaucracy is a big hurdle for small enterprises looking to tap traditional finance. 
A handful of unbanked businesses Reuters found across two townships were, in almost every case, owned by immigrants or asylum seekers and cited a lack of the right documents - a factor outside of banks' control - as the main reason their business didn't have an account.
""When you want to do things, they want a business account,"" said Vusi Coka, a South African running a tavern in Alexandra. He is struggling to get a mortgage because he can't show banks how his business is performing. 
He can't open an account for the tavern because it belonged to his late father, and the title hasn't been transferred into his name.
High fees are another barrier. Digital players have been able to make inroads in the retail market with cheaper products because, unlike traditional banks, they are not lumbered with expensive branch networks that push up costs. 
FNB is hoping its zero-fee offering will attract price-conscious entrepreneurs in townships, giving it access to data for cross-selling and growing the market for financial products. 
With Selpal serving as a ""trojan horse"", Vacy-Lyle said the lender is looking to bank 2,500 township wholesalers by 2022, and after that will look to bring in grocery stores, known as spazas, and taverns, as well as firms like hairdressers and auto repair shops.
While making it easier for such businesses to access financial services, especially credit, was a positive, Brendan Pearce, chief executive of FinMark Trust, said there was a question mark over whether they could make informed decisions. 
""There's a financial literacy issue,"" he said, adding fintech firms or others with a more specific focus could usually offer better products at better prices. 

""I'm not convinced commercial banks have the solution to financial inclusion.""

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 01:09AM ET</span>",Indian coffee tycoon Siddhartha's body found: police,"By Sachin Ravikumar and Sathvik N
MANGALURU/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian authorities said on Wednesday they have recovered the body of coffee baron V.G. Siddhartha from a river in southern India, after his disappearance on Monday sparked speculation he was facing intense financial pressure.
Siddhartha, the founder of the Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) chain, had not been reachable since late Monday, his flagship entity Coffee Day Enterprises said in a regulatory filing.
""Based on preliminary reports, the police have identified the body as that of V.G. Siddhartha,"" a police officer told Reuters, adding his family has been notified.
The recovery of Siddhartha's body unnerved investors in his flagship listed entity Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd even further on Wednesday, sending the stock plunging 20% to an all-time low of 122.75 rupees. The shares had already slid 20% and hit the lower circuit on Tuesday.
Siddhartha, whose Cafe Coffee Day chain has more than 1,600 stores across the country, was widely recognized for bringing the coffee shop culture to India - a largely tea-loving country - more than 10 years before global coffee shop giant  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) began its foray into the country.
He was also widely seen as a savvy venture capital investor, who made some prescient early investments in Indian IT services firms like Infosys Ltd and Mindtree Ltd in the 1990s. 
Siddhartha was traveling to Mangaluru, a port city about 350 kilometers from India's tech hub of Bengaluru, when he asked his driver to leave him on a bridge and drive ahead while he took a walk, a police official told Reuters. When Siddhartha did not return, the driver alerted the police.
Television channels showed rescue workers in rubber boats scouring the Nethravathi river near the bridge where Siddhartha, who hails from a coffee-growing family, was last seen.
Some Indian media reports said Siddhartha was under pressure over outstanding debt. A letter, purportedly written by Siddhartha, blamed an unidentified private equity partner for pressuring him into a share buyback, and tax authorities for ""harassment"" and decisions that hurt the company's liquidity.
""I fought for a long time, but today I gave up,"" the letter said, which was published by media https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/ive-failed-sorry-to-let-you-all-down-siddharthas-last-letter-found/articleshow/70444308.cms and could be viewed on social media.
Reuters was not able to confirm the authenticity of the letter. Coffee Day Enterprises shared the letter with regulators but also did not comment on its authenticity.

A doctor at the Wenlock Hospital in Mangaluru told Reuters that a post mortem was being conducted there on Wednesday.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine conglomerate San Miguel Corp (PS:SMC) is set to win a contract to build and operate an airport project worth 735.6 billion pesos ($14.47 billion), aimed at decongesting Manila's ageing facility, a government official said on Wednesday.
The new international airport, the country's largest transportation project to date, will support Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's ambitious $180 billion infrastructure modernization program that includes roads, bridges, ports, and the country's first subway.
San Miguel's unsolicited bid went unchallenged following a two-month period for companies to buy and submit Swiss challenge documents, Giovanni Lopez, chairman of the transport ministry's bids and awards committee, told reporters.
""It is our single biggest investment in our country,"" San Miguel President and Chief Operating Officer Ramon Ang said in a statement. ""The airport will be built at no cost to government, and with no subsidies or guarantees,"" he added.
The Philippine conglomerate has proposed building and operating an international airport in Bulacan province, north of the country's capital. The airport will be designed to cater to 100 million passengers annually, compared with the 31-million-passenger capacity of the existing main gateway.
Flight delays are typical across Philippine domestic airports, mostly due to backlogs at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport, which was rated among the world's worst airports.
The transportation department expects San Miguel to start construction late this year, Lopez said. It will feature four runways, aviation-related facilities and equipment and an eight-kilometer airport toll road. 
The government will formally hand over the 50-year airport concession to San Miguel after the conglomerate completes post-Swiss challenge documentation and other requirements, Lopez added.
San Miguel, which did not provide further details on the airport project financing, had pursued an aggressive expansion strategy since 2008 to bolster revenue, and added infrastructure, mining, petroleum and power assets to its staple food and beverage businesses.
Last year, the company asserted it does not need a partner to build the airport, in response to concerns that the project may be too big to handle alone.

Shares in San Miguel slipped as much as 2.2% after the government's announcement on Wednesday.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Fast-growing insurer FWD is seeking to launch operations in China ahead of any public offering and plans to bolster its non-life business in Asia, its chief executive said, as a potential shake-up looms in the region's insurance sector.
FWD, controlled by Richard Li, the entrepreneur and son of Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing, made headlines earlier this month with the $3 billion purchase of Siam Commercial Bank's life insurance unit in Thailand, just days after agreeing to buy the Hong Kong operations of U.S. insurer MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET) - a deal worth about $300 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Having spent more than $6 billion on half a dozen deals in the last six years, FWD has built up a presence in Hong Kong and Macau, Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.
FWD has applied for a license to operate a majority-owned joint venture in China, the world's No.2 insurance market, which, according to a Swiss Re Institute report, is forecast to account for 20% of global premium by 2029, up from 11% in 2018.
""It would be good to have China, but having a growth story in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), having a stable profitability in Japan, having a strong base in Hong Kong will be pretty compelling,"" said CEO Huynh Thanh Phong, while discussing the potential for an initial public offering (IPO).
Huynh refused to be drawn on the timing of any IPO, saying it was for the board and shareholders to decide. But separately two people with knowledge of the plans said FWD was aiming for the second half of next year - depending on progress in China.
ASIAN BATTLEGROUND
Billionaire Li laid the foundation of FWD in 2012 with the acquisition of ING's Hong Kong, Macau and Thailand units for $2.1 billion and has continued this bolt-on approach since.
""If you look at a typical life insurance setup, you can either grow organically in five to seven years or you do bolt-on acquisitions to shorten that time-frame,"" Huynh, who joined FWD in 2014 a year after its formal launch, told Reuters.
""(Insurance) M&A in Asia is very limited (and) we have to be very opportunistic,"" he said, identifying India, where the company is looking for a potential partner, and Australia as other markets FWD is interested in.
The Asian market, worth $1.7 trillion in premiums, is expected to account for 42% of global premiums by 2029 from about a third currently, the Swiss Re Institute report showed.
""Not many leading Asian insurance firms need to plug product or geographical gap via acquisitions, so it's a good time to be a buyer if you have the capital and the reason to do deals,"" said a M&A banker, who advised FWD on one of its deals.
Asia is also bracing for the spin-off of the international businesses of the UK's  Prudential  (LON:PRU), led by its Asian business boasting 15 million life insurance customers and $117 billion in assets, according to its 2018 annual report.
The spin-off will give Prudential Asia unit access to more capital which could be used for acquisitions, investment bankers have said.
FWD FINANCES
Compared with regional giants such as AIA and Prudential, FWD is still small: its five million customers give it $30 billion in assets, according to the company, compared with $230 billion for AIA.
Besides Li, other minority shareholders in FWD include Swiss Re, which came on board with a 12.3% stake in 2013, Singapore wealth fund GIC, and Chinese private equity firm Hopu Investments.
FWD has so far used a mix of equity and debt to finance its acquisitions, said the two sources cited earlier. Huynh said the company's shareholders were ""very supportive"" about its expansion and the company was ""very financially disciplined"", but declined to give specific details about its leverage. 
Speculation about its IPO plans or other funding options have grown as FWD has expanded. Earlier this month, ratings agency Moody's cut it outlook to negative from stable after the acquisition of the MetLife Hong Kong business.
Fitch also put the company on ""rating watch evolving"" citing uncertainty about the impact of the acquisition on the company's capital, debt service capabilities, and financial flexibility.
FWD Life HK, which accounts for nearly half of the group assets and is the ninth-largest life insurer by premium in Hong Kong, has doubled its revenue since its launch and was at $2 billion in 2017, according to a July 10 Moody's report.
Hong Kong, Thailand and Japan are its top three markets in terms of customers.
In Japan, where it launched in 2017 with the purchase of the life insurance business of American International Group (NYSE:AIG), new business premiums rose 39% to $378 million last year. The same measure in Thailand dropped 10% to $198 million, according to company documents seen by Reuters. 
NON-LIFE PUSH
FWD's next round of acquisitions is expected to be focused on non-life insurance business, which covers automobile, real estate and travel insurance, said Huynh.
FWD is ""actively looking"" for non-life insurance businesses in Southeast Asia to compliment existing operations in Hong Kong and Singapore, Huynh said, adding life insurance would remain a dominant part of its business. 

FWD has in recent months hired senior executives, some of them from AIG to work on its non-life business plans, said the two earlier sources, who declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media.

The Global Times, China’s state-owned media, said the U.S. must show “sincerity” in trade talks to ease tensions between the two sides, adding that the U.S. side should hold ""reasonable expectations"" after making ""unrealistic demands that infringe upon China's sovereignty and dignity"".
“If Washington still holds the illusion that Beijing will somehow cave in and compromise on issues concerning sovereignty and other related core interests to reach a deal, then no deal is fine,” the article said.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) iPhone sales dropped to less than half of quarterly revenue for the first time in seven years, but CEO Tim Cook on Tuesday described the change as successfully diversifying away from a single product and forecast results above Wall Street targets.
That strategy proved especially useful in China, the world's largest smartphone market. Investors feared a drumbeat of negative shipment data from the Chinese government and analysts meant problems for the iPhone maker.
Apple's greater China sales, which had gone into a near free fall earlier this year, dipped only slightly, assuaging concerns that trade tension were undermining Apple's standing in one of its most important markets. Shares rose 4.25% after hours.
Moribund global mobile phone sales have led Apple to focus on accessories like the Apple Watch and growth in music, apps, gaming, video and a credit card coming in August. In mainland China, Cook said the overall number of Apple device users had grown in the fiscal third quarter, helping to increase the market for its services, whose sales were up by more than 10% there.
""We actually grew in mainland China,"" Cook told Reuters. ""Non-iPhone revenue grew 17%. We grew in every category outside of iPhone.""
But globally, iPhone sales fell 12% to $25.99 billion, after dropping 17% in the previous quarter, and matched Wall Street targets.
Graphic: iPhone fade - https://tmsnrt.rs/2yAEoCh
Wearables and other accessories revenue rose nearly 50%, topping expectations.
Services revenue rose 12.6% to $11.46 billion, slowing and slightly missing expectations but setting a new record.
Apple said it expects revenue for the current fiscal fourth quarter of between $61 billion and $64 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $61.02 billion. At the high end of Apple's forecasted range, sales would beat the prior year's $62.90 billion in sales, despite the fact that analysts expected continued lackluster iPhone sales until 5G models arrive in 2020.
For the fiscal third quarter ended in June, Apple reported a 1% rise in revenue to $53.8 billion and a 7% drop in earnings per share to $2.18, compared with expectations of $53.39 billion and $2.10 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said he was pleasantly surprised to see iPhone sales declines slow down versus the prior quarter.
""You really don’t hear people talk about their phones like they did several years ago,"" Eddins said. But, ""the key is that when people want to splurge on a phone, they do it with an Apple product.""
Apple did not give the number of active Apple devices, but in January it said it was 1.4 billion, with 900 million of those being iPhones. Investors used the number, called the installed base, as a proxy for how many subscribers it can gain for its services business. Cook told investors on a conference call Tuesday that Apple has 420 million paid subscribers to its own services and third-party apps. The company has set a goal of 500 million by 2020.
Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple shareholder Gullane Capital Partners, said he wants to see services growth return to the 20% range and thinks Apple needs to use its billions in cash to buy media properties to fuel its forthcoming television service.
""You have to have a bigger installed base and have services that people get value from,"" Miller said.
TRADE TENSION STILL LOOMS LARGE
Apple reported results as U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators resumed off-and-on talks. U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended new tariffs on a final $300 billion of Chinese imports, which would include iPhones.
Trade tension has slowed down economic growth in China, a major market for Apple, which effectively cut iPhone prices in China earlier this year after currency exchange rates had made its phones too expensive for many Chinese consumers.
Apple's market share in China declined to 5.8% from 6.4%, according to market research firm Canalys, in part because smartphone rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd gained market share to become the top handset seller in the country.
But Apple experienced a smaller market share loss than competitors such as  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810), Oppo and Vivo, according to Canalys data. Cook said that iPhone price adjustments, plus the Chinese government's move to cut phone taxes, helped keep iPhone sales in China from eroding further.
""Our trade-in and financing programs are doing extremely well in China,"" Cook told Reuters. ""Because of the active installed base is growing in China, our services business is doing very well, growing double digits.""
Apple shares have gained more than 20% since early June, when shares dropped on news that the U.S. Department of Justice had jurisdiction over the company in a potential probe as part of a broader review of whether technology giants engage in anticompetitive practices.
Apple said revenue for its ""Wearables, home and accessories"" segment that contains devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods was $5.53 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $4.81 billion.
Apple said it returned more than $21 billion to shareholders during the fiscal third quarter, including $17 billion in share repurchases. It declared a dividend of 77 cents per share."
1166,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 10:13PM ET</span>",China probes small bank shareholdings as risk worries persist,"By Cheng Leng and Sumeet Chatterjee
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China is sharpening its scrutiny of small banks' shareholders amid fears that loans from the lenders to big investors could prove a weak point in the country's financial system, jolted by the state's weekend rescue of one lender and recent takeover of another.
While nominally small, China's numerous small city commercial banks risk having outsized significance because of their close ties to the rest of the banking system as well as with bigger shareholders, many of whom are giant companies.
Earlier this month, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) asked banks and some other financial firms for details of any investor building up stakes of 5% or more without required regulatory approvals.
The regulator also asked the firms if they had disclosed all business transactions with their main owners, according to a regulatory notice seen by Reuters.
Regulators have also conducted spot checks at some smaller banks in the last two months to probe possible misuse of capital linked to shareholders and transferring of ownership interests, said four people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The scrutiny comes amid concerns that some debt-heavy Chinese private enterprises have amassed substantial stakes in smaller banks without regulatory approval and are using the lenders for their personal borrowings. 
""There may be many shareholders using small Chinese banks as ATM machines, but I don't think we have enough understanding of bank ownership to know,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Hong Kong-based Orient Capital Research.
""Certainly if there are under-capitalized corporates as majority shareholders of the less well-funded smaller banks you could have a bank run,"" he said, adding the regulators have so far done a good job of rescuing ailing financial firms.
Regulators have also asked banks to detail transactions with any related parties, which are entities controlled or jointly controlled by their major shareholders, between January 2018 and June 2019.
Another risk is that some big shareholders have pledged their shares as collateral for loans or other purposes such as acquisition capital or are investing in opaque wealth management products, said another lawyer who works with the CBIRC.
The pledging of shares can leave the bank at risk of a sudden shift in its ownership - potentially even a change of control - if the shareholder forfeits the shares in struggling to repay the loans.
The CBIRC didn't respond to Reuters' request for comment on its latest crackdown. The people spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
RELATED ENTITIES
Regulators' focus on small banks and their connections has intensified since late May, when the surprise takeover of Baoshang Bank sent shockwaves through China's interbank markets, sharply raising borrowing costs - not all of which have returned to their pre-takeover levels.
In their seizure of Baoshang, regulators cited improper and illegal use of significant bank funds by Tomorrow Holdings, which held 89% of the Inner Mongolia-based bank's shares.
""The rationale behind the checks arises from recent corporate activities. And such activities do not only exist in Baoshang Bank,"" said a Beijing-based lawyer, referring to shareholders' borrowing from banks.
A second bank was rescued last weekend with three state-controlled financial firms agreeing to inject funds into Bank of Jinzhou (HK:0416). The total amount to be invested was not announced, but they will take at least 17.3% in the troubled lender.
Shares in Bank of Jinzhou have not traded since April, when its auditor, EY, quit after refusing to sign off on its 2018 accounts because it could not agree with the bank on how to verify the actual use of loans made by the bank, some of which it feared did not match the purpose given. 
The bank counts debt-laden Yinchuan Baota Refined Chemical Industry Co, a privately-run refining and petrochemical group, as one of its top three shareholders, according to its 2018 interim report. The chairman of Yinchuan's parent was arrested in December 2018 for alleged fraud. 
Another example of the ties that build up between banks and their shareholders came last month with a fine of 200,000 yuan ($29,027.58) imposed on Bank of Liuzhou by the CBIRC for breaking limits on loans to a single group. 
While rules limit banks to lending 15% of their net capital to a single entity, Bank of Liuzhou extended a 3.64-billion yuan credit line to its main shareholder, Liuzhou City Construction Investment Development Co, by end-2018, equivalent to 23.79% of the bank's net capital. 
CORPORATE WHO'S WHO
Large banks in China, as elsewhere, have shareholder registers that tend to read like as a fund manager who's who. Not so for the smaller banks, whose registers often read more like a who's who of the corporate world and provincial government entities. 
Chinese liquor giant Kweichow  Moutai  (SS:600519) is the No.2 shareholder in Bank of Guizhou, which last month filed for a Hong Kong stock listing to raise up to $1 billion, with a 14.13% stake in the city commercial bank.
Moutai chairman Li Baofang said in May last year the group's financial arm had become ""more and more important for the development of Moutai"".
Chinese banks, like most of their global peers, don't report client-specific business details, but a review of Bank of Guizhou's IPO prospectus showed overall credit exposure to related parties as a percentage of its loan book soared to 44.3% at the end of March 31, 2019, up from just 6.8% in 2017 and bringing it close to the regulatory limit of 50%. 
Several heavily-indebted Chinese conglomerates are also big bank shareholders. 
China  Evergrande  (HK:3333), which has one of the highest debt ratios in the Chinese property sector, last month agreed to inject $1.9 billion into Hong Kong-listed Shengjing Bank (HK:2066), raising its stake to 25% from 17.3%, as the bank faced ""a real need to raise its level of capital adequacy"".
Shengjing Bank's loans to related parties jumped nearly six times at the end of last year, from 2017, even as its core capital adequacy ratio, which measures a bank's financial strength, dropped half a percentage point to 8.52% in the same period, its annual report showed.
Among other major bank stake owners, developer China Vanke (SZ:000002) is the largest shareholder with nearly 28% of the underlying shares in  Huishang Bank  (HK:3698), while a unit of the struggling HNA Group conglomerate owns 14.6% in unlisted Yingkou Coastal Bank.
China Vanke declined to comment. The other companies and banks did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
""The shareholding structure of some high-risk smaller banks might seem to be okay from the outside, but actually they're being hollowed out by transactions related to the shareholders,"" said a vice president of a city commercial bank.

""It's time to see through them with tighter regulations.""

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 09:57PM ET</span>",Philippines' Jollibee sets sights on Indonesia with Coffee Bean beachhead,"By Neil Jerome Morales and Martin Petty
MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines'  Jollibee Foods  Corp (PS:JFC) is training its sights on Indonesia, with newly acquired U.S. chain Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf its entry point in the economically expanding and densely populated Southeast Asian neighbor, its top officials said.
Jollibee has for years planned to bring its Chickenjoy fried chicken and sweet spaghetti restaurants to Indonesia, but last week's $100 million investment for the struggling coffee chain has bought it a foothold in the market of 260 million people.
""One thing that might emerge and very interesting is Indonesia,"" Chief Financial Officer Ysmael Baysa told Reuters.
The restaurant scene in Indonesia is cornered by the likes of Restoran Sederhana, McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), and Yum! Brands Inc's (N:YUM) KFC and Pizza Hut.
""Coffee Bean gives us an immediate presence in Indonesia and also gives us a platform on which we can further expand our business there,"" Baysa said.
Jollibee's purchase of money-losing Coffee Bean from private equity firm Advent International and others was its largest foreign acquisition to date, and its second coffee brand after Highlands Coffee in Vietnam. Coffee Bean has 101 outlets in Indonesia among its 1,189 branches across 27 countries.
Jollibee, the Philippines' best-known brand, started as two ice cream parlors four decades ago, but soon shifted to the burgers and fried chicken that have been a big draw at home and among many of the estimated 10 million Filipinos who work or have settled overseas.
Through its 12 brands and franchises, Jollibee operates 3,195 outlets in the Philippines and has a further 1,418 dotted across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the United States, Britain and China, among them Smashburger, Yonghee King, Chow King, Greenwich, Red Ribbon, plus franchises of Dunkin in China and Burger King in the Philippines.
Jollibee is eyeing a turnaround of Coffee Bean to make it profitable in 12-18 months, Baysa said. Coffee Bean posted $313 million in revenue and a net loss of $21 million last year.
The Philippine fast-food chain was worth $5.8 billion prior to announcing its acquisition but shed $890 million in market value in two days as investors sold its stock on concerns about it over-spending on a money-losing coffee chain. It has since recouped more than half of the losses.
Jollibee President and Chief Executive Ernesto Tanmantiong said the firm aims for 50% of sales to come from overseas within three to five years, from about 27% now.
It aims to be among the world's five biggest fast-food firms, he said, adding it has no qualms about delving into a coffee market peppered with big names such as  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and Tim Hortons.
""It's a very big market to enter,"" he told Reuters, adding that the company would continue to broaden its portfolio of businesses when it sees good opportunities.
""Our strategy is to have strong organic growth as well as strategic acquisitions,"" he said."
1168,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 08:51PM ET</span>",Top Mexican companies' results take hit from Nicaragua crisis,"By Noe Torres and Ismael Lopez
MEXICO CITY/MANAGUA (Reuters) - Some of Mexico's largest companies operating in Nicaragua are counting the costs of a political crisis engulfing the Central American country since violent protests against President Daniel Ortega erupted in April last year.
The demonstrations, in which more than 300 people have died, have hit Nicaragua's fragile economy hard. Gross domestic product shrank by 3.8% in 2018, and the World Bank said in April economists expected the slump to deepen this year.
Three of Mexico's top companies - cement maker Cemex (MX:CEMEXCPO), bottler Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) FEMSA and telecoms company America Movil - said in reporting their second quarter results that their operations in Nicaragua had suffered. Mexico's results season ended on Friday.
Cemex Latam Holdings (CN:CLH) said its Nicaragua business was being hurt by a downturn in the construction sector, which shrank 21% in 2018, according to central bank data.
""The crisis remains unresolved and continues to affect economic activity, including demand for cement,"" the Cemex subsidiary said in second quarter results, without giving details.
Coca-Cola FEMSA (MX:KOFUBL) reported a drop in its local business since the first quarter.
""Nicaragua is still a challenging environment to operate in,"" Constantino Spas, the company's chief financial officer, said in an earnings call with analysts.
Nicaraguan internal commerce fell 11.4% in 2018, according to the central bank. Experts consulted by Reuters highlighted tourism, the retail sector and manufacturing as some of the worst-affected sectors of the economy.
""We are living a crisis of confidence marked by uncertainty from consumers and investors,"" said Jose Adan Aguerri, president of Nicaragua's main business association COSEP.
America Movil (MX:AMXL) reported a 7.1% fall in its income from providing telecommunication services in Nicaragua in the second quarter. It also said it had lost 406,000 mobile phone subscribers in the country in the period.
To be sure, not all companies have been hit.
Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) de Mexico (MX:WALMEX), a subsidiary of U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Inc., said sales in Nicaragua had helped boost its income from Central America during the quarter.
Mexican dairy company Grupo Lala (MX:LALAB) reported that improving sales in both Nicaragua and Guatemala helped its quarterly sales for Central America rise 4.4% in dollar terms to 710 million pesos ($37.24 million).

""This is the first quarter (since) the crisis in Nicaragua showing early signs of top and bottom line recovery,"" Lala's vice president of finances Alberto Arellano told an earnings call.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 08:19PM ET</span>",U.S. Congress seeks to jump start stalled self-driving car bill,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two key committees in the U.S. Congress on Tuesday said they will revive efforts to pass long-stalled legislation to speed the adoption of self-driving cars.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee and Senate Commerce Committee sent automakers, safety groups and others interested in the bill a request for input and said they were working on a ""bipartisan and bicameral basis to develop a self-driving car bill.""
In December, Congress abandoned efforts to pass legislation on self-driving cars before it adjourned, in a blow to companies like General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo unit.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, representing General Motors, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), Toyota Motor Corp and others, praised the announcement.
""Right now various countries are exploring regulations that will shape the future of autonomous vehicles, and the U.S. risks losing its leadership in this life-saving, life-changing technology, so we urge Congress to move forward now, this year,"" spokeswoman Gloria Bergquist said.
The letter sought input by Aug. 23 on a variety of issues including federal rules - both current or new - testing, privacy, disability access, cybersecurity, consumer education and crash data.
The U.S. House unanimously passed legislation in September 2017 by voice vote to speed the adoption of self-driving cars, but it stalled in the Senate last year. Despite a series of concessions by automakers, the bill could not overcome objections of some Democrats who said it did not do enough to resolve safety concerns.
Under the prior legislation, automakers would have been able to win exemptions from safety rules that require human controls. States could set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections but not set performance standards.
In October, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was considering a pilot program to allow real-world road testing for a limited number of vehicles without human controls.
Automakers must currently meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of them written under the assumption that a licensed driver would be able to control the vehicle using traditional controls.
In January 2017, GM filed a petition with NHTSA seeking an exemption to deploy fully automated vehicles without steering wheels before the end of 2019; that petition was still under review.

Last week, GM's self-driving unit, Cruise, said it was delaying the commercial deployment of cars past its target of 2019 as more testing of the vehicles was required.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investment in Britain's car sector fell by more than 70 percent in the first half of the year due to concerns about a disorderly Brexit, an industry body said on Wednesday, warning that leaving the EU without an agreement was the ""worst outcome"".
The automotive industry, Britain's biggest exporter of goods which employs over 800,000 people, is one of the most vociferous opponents of a no-deal Brexit, fearing additional tariffs and bureaucracy could halt production. 
Investment fell to 90 million pounds ($109.50 million) in the first half of 2019 compared to 347.3 million pounds in the same period in 2018 and 647.4 million in the first half of 2017, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. 
""The fear of no-deal is causing investors to sit on their hands,"" said Chief Executive Mike Hawes. 
""The worst outcome would be no-deal. That's what they fear, that is why they're not investing."" 
Firms have also spent at least 330 million pounds on Brexit contingencies such as securing warehousing space and stockpiling parts in order to mitigate the impact of possible delays to the movement of models and components at ports. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to secure a new deal with the EU after his predecessor Theresa May failed to get parliamentary approval for her agreement but he is prepared to take Britain out of the bloc without a deal on October 31. 
Brexiteers have long argued that Germany, Europe's biggest economy, which exports hundreds of thousands of cars to Britain, will do its utmost to protect that trade, while the British government under Johnson is now ramping up preparations and has said it could help affected sectors.
Full-year investment, based on new publicly announced decisions on fresh spending, will be boosted by a roughly 1 billion pound move by Jaguar Land Rover (NS:TAMO) to make electric cars in Britain. 
But spending has fallen every year since 2014, down from 5.83 billion pounds in 2013 to 1.1 billion pounds in 2017 and 589 million pounds in 2018. 
Meanwhile production in the first six months of the year slumped 20% as the global car industry faces weakening demand in key markets, trade tensions and a fall in diesel vehicle sales in major European countries. 
""We need an internationally competitive business environment to encourage more investment, more innovation and more growth,"" said Hawes.

""That starts with an ambitious Brexit deal that maintains frictionless trade and we look to the new administration to get a deal done quickly so manufacturers can get back to the business of building cars.""

(Reuters) -  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) raised its 2019 sales forecast on Tuesday, benefiting from several years of tailoring its chocolates and cookies to cater to consumer tastes in emerging markets such as China and India.
However, the company warned that a hard Brexit could require it to make changes to its prices and sourcing.
Mondelez has been aggressively investing in marketing and molding its products to attract consumers in emerging markets where rising demand for its Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies has countered sluggish sales in developed countries. 
The company has previously told Reuters that ""the big bulk"" of a $150 million increase in global investment this year - the first hike in five years - will be in rural India.
The efforts lifted the company's second-quarter organic sales, which exclude the impact from acquisitions and currency changes, 7.6% in emerging markets.
China, India, Southeast Asia, Russia and Mexico were among the biggest drivers of that growth, company executives said on a post-earnings call with analysts. 
Encouraged by the second-quarter growth, the company raised its full-year organic net revenue forecast to over 3%, compared with the prior expectation of 2% to 3%. 
The Easter holiday also boosted demand for chocolates in the second quarter, especially in Europe, the company said.
Like other packaged food companies, the Toblerone maker has been raising prices for its cookies, gum and chocolates to counter higher raw material and labor costs.
Pricing in Latin America rose 11.5 percentage points in the reported quarter, the company said.
HARD BREXIT
New British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said that if the European Union continues to refuse to renegotiate a withdrawal agreement he will take Britain out on Oct. 31 without a deal.
""If there is a hard Brexit, there will certainly be implications to our business,"" Chief Executive Officer Dirk Van de Put said on the call.
Uncertainty around Brexit and its effect on consumer spending in the United Kingdom have been an overhang over the company's European business, its largest.
Mondelez has been stockpiling all its European-made products, which include BelVita biscuits and Milka chocolate, due to the threat of a no-deal Brexit.
Net revenue slipped 0.8% to $6.06 billion in the three months ended June 30, but beat analysts' average estimate of $6.03 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Excluding items, the company earned 57 cents per share, in line with analysts' average estimate.
Mondelez also gave an upbeat 2019 adjusted earnings per share forecast, expecting a 5% rise, compared with the prior forecast of between 3% and 5%.

The company's shares rose about 1% to $55.40 in extended trading.

(Reuters) -  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN) on Tuesday said its second-quarter revenue fell 3% due to more competition for its older off-patent drugs, but rising sales of newer medicines helped its results exceed Wall Street forecasts. 
Amgen also said its experimental cancer drug AMG510 has shown activity in patients with colorectal and appendiceal cancer, helping to boost the company's shares by nearly 3% to $181 in extended trading.
The U.S. biotechnology company, which presented data in June showing that AMG510 also appeared to be effective against lung cancer, said it may begin a trial later this year that could serve as the basis for a U.S. regulatory application seeking approval.
AMG510 is part of a growing trend of precision medicines that target gene mutations driving cancer regardless of in which organ the disease originated. 
""I'm very impressed with the emerging safety profile that we are seeing with AMG510,"" David Reese, Amgen's head of research and development, said on a conference call on Tuesday.
Amgen said second-quarter adjusted earnings per share rose 4% to $3.97, topping analysts' average expectations by 41 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. A lower number of outstanding shares contributed to the earnings beat.
Total revenue of $5.87 billion, while lower than a year ago, topped analysts' estimates of $5.66 billion.
""Amgen had a good quarter all around,"" said Jefferies analyst Michael Yee. ""They tightened up guidance to the higher end of the range, which is where the Street is at.""
The company raised the lower end of its full-year outlook and now expects adjusted earnings of $13.75 to $14.30 per share on revenue of $22.4 billion to $22.9 billion. It had previously forecast $13.25 to $14.30 per share on revenue of $22 billion to $22.9 billion.
Sales of potent cholesterol fighter Repatha rose 3% to $152 million, below Wall Street estimates of $157 million. Sales of Amgen's new migraine drug Aimovig, which competes with similar new treatments from Eli Lilly (N:LLY) and Teva (TA:TEVA), totaled $83 million for the quarter, beating the $77.4 million projected by analysts. 
But sales of Neulasta, which fights infections by boosting white blood cells, fell 25% to $824 million, while sales of kidney drug Sensipar plunged 71% to $122 million as competition from cheaper generics and biosimilars increased.

Amgen reported a net profit of $2.17 billion, or $3.57 per share, for the quarter, compared with a profit of $2.29 billion, or $3.50 per share, a year ago.

1173,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 07:14PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. All Eyes on Fed
The Federal Reserve, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, takes center stage on Wednesday.
Expectations are running high that a quarter-point cut is on the menu with a good measure of dovish policy language hinting at future rate cuts. 
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to a range of 2.0% to 2.25% from 2.25% to 2.5%.
Investors likely will parse the Fed's policy statement and Powell's presser after the announcement for an update on the Fed's bond-buying program.
The Fed's monetary policy decision comes amid a recent string of favorable economic data, including continued consumer strength, though subdued inflation, which is below the central bank's 2% target, remains the overarching headwind for the central bank. 
The Fed's policy decision comes at 2 PM ET (18:00 GMT) and will be followed Powell's news conference at 2.30 PM ET.
Today, President Donald Trump called for the Fed to come through with a ""large"" cut. The president has been agitating for lower rates to further stimulate the economy and also give the U.S. an edge in trade disputes by weakening the dollar.
Trump called on the central bank to make a ""large"" cut to offset several rate hikes last year.
Trump called on the central bank to make a ""large"" cut to offset several rate hikes last year.
The release of ADP’s measure of private-sector employment for July, before markets open, will also be in focus. 
The report comes at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT).
Economists, on average, expect that private nonfarm payrolls rose by 150,000 in July, up from a gain of 102,000 in June. 
The report comes ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report due Friday from the Labor Department. 
2. Apple, AMD Give Mixed Signals
There were mixed fortunes for tech from today's postmarket earnings, which could make investors even more indecisive as they wait for the Fed news.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose about 4% in after-hours trading as the comapny beat on the top and bottom lines.
But chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) could weigh on other semiconductor stocks. AMD fell about 3% after hours as its revenue guidance fell short of conesnsus esimates.
GE is expected to deliver second-quarter earnings before the market opens on Wednesday. 
Investors will be eager for an update on the conglomerate's turnaround progress as it seeks to cut costs amid efforts to boost cash flow. 
CFO Jamie Miller told investors at a conference the company expected to burn through $1 to $2 billion cash during the second quarter.
GE (NYSE:GE) is expected to report earnings of 12 cents a share on revenue of $28.48 billion, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com. 
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), meanwhile, reports fiscal third-quarter earnings after the markets close.

3. Crude Inventories on Tap
The Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly report on petroleum supplies is due Wednesday. The report is closely watched as a gauge for measuring oil demand and supply. 
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data, while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report, that showed weekly crude stockpiles fell by 6 million barrels last week.
The EIA is also expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 2.59 million barrels for the week ended July 27, which would mark the seventh-weekly fall in crude stockpiles.
Crude oil futures rose 2% to settle at $58.05 a barrel today."

The technology company reported earnings per share of $2.18 on revenue of $53.81B. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.09 on revenue of $53.3 billion. That compared to EPS of $2.34 on revenue of $53.27 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company had reported EPS of $2.46 on revenue of $58.02 billion in the fiscal-second quarter. 
Apple reported $11.45 billion in services revenue for its third quarter of 2019, below analysts’ expectations of $11.65 billion. 
But Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters that, after factoring out a one-time payment from lawsuits a year ago and foreign-exchange effects, the services segment growth rate would have been 18%.
Services gross margin rose to 64.1% up slightly from 63.8% last quarter.
The higher-margin services segment has taken on significant importance as the tech giant attempts to reduce its reliance on iPhone sales.
The company reported iPhone revenue fell 12% to $26 billion, in-line with estimates. The iPhone represented 48.3% of total revenue in the quarter.
The weaker iPhone sales were driven by a subdued Chinese smartphone market, where some of Apple's rivals have already rolled out 5G-enabled phones.
Looking ahead, the company said it expects to generate fourth-quarter gross margins of 37.5% to 38.5%, in-line with estimates of 38.3%.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 05:21PM ET</span>",Enterprise Products in deal with Chevron to develop crude oil port,"(Reuters) -  Enterprise Products Partners LP  (N:EPD) signed long-term agreements with a  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) unit to develop its Sea Port Oil Terminal in the Gulf of Mexico, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.
Enterprise's offshore crude oil terminal is one of at least eight projects proposed off the Texas and Louisiana coasts to export oil from the region's shale fields.
It would compete with projects proposed by commodities trader Trafigura Ltd, private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (O:CG), and pipeline operators Magellan Midstream Partners (N:MMP), Tallgrass Energy LP (N:TGE), and Phillips 66 (N:PSX).
The companies hope to take advantage of rising shale production from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, especially when another 2.3 million barrels per day of shale is expected to land at the U.S. Gulf Coast in the next year as new pipelines begin operation.
Enterprise signed the deals with Chevron U.S.A. Inc (CUSA) and it aims to build the export terminal at a site about 40 miles (64 km) off the coast of Houston and connect it to its existing crude pipelines. Up to two very large crude carriers (VLCCs) could moor at the site and load up to 2 million barrels per day.
The facility would connect to an onshore tank farm able to hold up to 4.8 million barrels of crude oil, according to its federal permit application.
The company said construction of the project is subject to the required approvals and licenses from the federal Maritime Administration, which is currently reviewing the application.
""The SPOT facility provides opportunity to significantly expand our export capacity and access multiple market centers as we increase our crude oil produced out of the Permian,"" said George Wall, president of Chevron Supply and Trading, a division of CUSA."

The Fed is expected to cut its federal funds rate, the rate it wants banks to charge each other for overnight loans, by a quarter point to 2% to 2.25%. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitoring Tool puts the odds at 100%. A second quarter-point rate cut is expected to come in September, though there is skepticism the rate cut is really needed.
The waiting meant many investors and traders weren't willing to take big positions ahead of the Fed announcement at 2 PM ET (18:00 GMT) 
The S&P 500 finished down 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.24% and the Dow dropped 0.1%.

Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitoring Tool puts the odds at 100%, with a second rate cut coming in September, though there is skepticism the rate cut is really needed.
Meanwhile, as investors and traders waited for the Fed decision and earnings reports from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) after the Tuesday close, energy investors started reacting to the immediate stimulus of higher crude prices.
Apple shares were off slightly ahead of the fiscal-third-quarter report, but it beat market expectations. In after-hours trading, the shares were up around 4%. If the gains hold on Wednesday, its market cap could top $1 trillion for the first time since last fall.
Futures trading Tuesday afternoon suggests a weak open, but the real action will come after the Fed announcement.
 
West Texas Intermediate crude rose 2.1% to $58.05 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, climbed 1.6% to $64.72. Prices moved higher because of hopes a rate cut will boost economic activity and demand for energy. In addition, traders saw reports that Iranian exports were down substantially. The U.S. Energy Information Administration will issue its weekly report on oil inventories Wednesday morning. 
Those gains – plus higher natural gas prices – boosted stocks of oil-and-gas production companies as well as big integrated companies.   Noble Energy   (NYSE:NBL) was up nearly 6%. Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) added 1.1%.
Among the majors,   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP) were all higher.   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) was down slightly.
The Dow briefly pushed into the green, partly because of strong earnings from Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), up 3.8%, and a rebound in shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA). But the blue chips were pulled down by   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC),   Verizon Communications   (NYSE:VZ) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD)
The S&P and Nasdaq remained stubbornly in the red all day.
Interest rates were higher, with the 10-Year Treasury yield drifting up to 2.06% from 2.055% on Monday.
Energy, real estate, materials and industrial stocks were the strongest market sectors on Tuesday. Utilities, telecommunications and consumer discretionary stocks were lower.

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 04:11PM ET</span>",Mineral-rich Ecuadorean province requests popular referendum on mining,"QUITO (Reuters) - The government of a key mining province in southern Ecuador has proposed a popular referendum on the development of new mines in the region, the latest obstacle to market-friendly President Lenin Moreno's efforts to attract foreign mining investment.
Azuay province is home to several potentially lucrative gold, silver and copper projects, including the Loma Larga project operated by Canada's INV Metals (TO:INV) and the Rio Blanco mine, owned by a Chinese consortium consisting of Junefield Mineral Resources Limited and Hunan Gold Group.
But provincial prefect Yaku Perez on Tuesday requested the South American country's Constitutional Court make mining development subject to a popular referendum, expressing concerns about mining's environmental impacts.
""We will be the first province in the country to decide between gold and water,"" Perez, also an indigenous community leader, told reporters. ""We will make it so that very soon Azuay and Ecuador are free of metallic mining.""
Last month, the Constitutional Court ruled against a request to require community consultations over the Cascabel mine in northern Ecuador, allowing Australia's SolGold (L:SOLG) to continue developing what is seen as one of the most promising copper projects in the world.
That was a victory for Moreno, who sees developing the OPEC nation's largely untapped mining sector as crucial to reviving the country's moribund economy and weaning it off its dependence on crude exports.
His plans, however, have run into opposition from groups concerned about potential environmental damages.
Azuay has proven particularly resistant to foreign miners. In March, a popular referendum in Azuay went against INV, and it is now seeking to relocate its Loma Larga project. The Rio Blanco project has been halted for more than a year due to a court ruling.
Conflicts between large-scale miners and indigenous and environmental groups are common in Latin America. Earlier this year an indigenous community in Peru set up a road blockade at a Chinese-owned copper mine in a dispute over compensation, while a series of dam bursts at mines in Brazil have led to backlash.
Peru passed a law in 2011 giving indigenous groups the right to weigh in on national decisions affecting their communities, including mining and oil extraction."

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 04:02PM ET</span>",U.S. could have decision on companies selling to Huawei by next week,"SAO PAULO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration could respond by next week to companies that have requested special licenses to sell to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday during a visit to Brazil. 
Ross said he expects a decision on the licenses will be ""forthcoming"" by the time he returns to the United States, after making additional stops in Argentina and Peru over the next few days.
The Trump administration has warned that Huawei could be a vehicle for Chinese espionage and put the company on a so-called ""entity list,"" meaning that U.S. corporations that conduct business with the telecoms giant now require special licenses to do so. 
The licensing decisions would give much needed clarity to American companies, which have been looking for guidance since U.S. President Donald Trump promised in late June to provide some relief to firms that did business with Huawei. 
Ross' comments came as senior Trump administration officials meet with Chinese negotiators in Shanghai this week to revive trade negotiations that broke down in May. 
Ross told reporters in a briefing he has received more than 50 applications so far for special licenses to do business with Huawei, but he expects to receive more. 
""The president and I met with representatives from the supply chain industry a week ago and a number said they have not sent the requests,"" Ross said.
""We are interested in getting them all together to see them as a unified bloc.""

Ross is in Brazil as part of centennial celebrations of the American Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo and will be traveling to Brasilia on Wednesday.

1190,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 04:01PM ET</span>",StockBeat - McDermott Warns Investors to Brace for Loss; Shares Crash,"Investing.com – Engineering and construction company McDermott International slumped to a 15-year low on Tuesday after warning it would swing to an annual loss amid a lack of new business and customer wins. 
The company cut its guidance, forecasting a $310 million net loss for the full year, compared with a previous forecast for a $170 million profit. McDermott (NYSE:MDR) plunged 37%. 
The warning of a loss comes as revenue estimates for the year were trimmed to $9.5 billion from $10 billion, which the company blamed on several headwinds, including soft second-quarter results, a ""slippage"" in new business and customer changes on several projects and a shift in the expected timing of remaining incentives on the Cameron liquid natural gas project in Louisiana.
The second quarter was far from kind, with the company reporting a loss of $0.07 a share, compared with a profit of $0.28 a share a year earlier, confounding consensus estimate of a profit of $0.09 per share, according to Investing.com. Revenue of $2.14 billion, up from $1.74 billion a year earlier, also fell short of estimates of $2.26 billion. 
In the earnings call that followed the quarterly results, the company expressed optimism that the benefits of its merger with Chicago Bridge & Iron, completed in May last year, would soon be realized and boost performance. 
""We're not happy with the magnitude of the loss for the quarter which, to a certain degree, is extending the overall timing of our transition period, but we fully expect benefits of the combination to become more evident next year,"" said President and CEO David Dickson. 
McDermott, long a player in constructing oil and gas production and related facilities, has been struggling with profits in the last few years. Tuesday's earnings warning basically wiped out this year's stock gains. The stock had been up as much as 67% for the year when it hit $10.95 on July 24. the stock has fallen about 75% since a January 2018 peak. "

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Tuesday after a fresh warning from President Donald Trump to China pressured technology shares, while investors speculated the scale of an interest rate cut at the end of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.
Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) results after markets close will paint a clear picture of the impact of trade tensions with China. Shares of the iPhone maker fell 0.76%, contributing the most to the tech sector's (SPLRCT) 0.64% drop.
""Investors are very concerned about how weak Apple's Chinese business will do,"" said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware.
As trade talks between the world's two biggest economies resumed on Tuesday, Trump warned China against trying to wait out his first term in office to finalize a deal.
Market participants are now bracing for what message the Fed will send if it pushes ahead with a well-telegraphed move to ease policy that has driven Wall Street's main indexes to record highs in the past few weeks and contributed to the S&P 500 index's 20% gain for the year.
With a quarter-percentage-point cut in rates at the end of the meeting on Wednesday fully priced-in, investors will monitor how Fed Chairman Jerome Powell manages debate about whether the stimulus is necessary and what that says about the attitude of the U.S. central bank to doing more in the months ahead.
""The Fed has a very strong rationale for cutting interest rates, that is to stimulate growth and inflation, but policymakers have to resort to justifications to keep the expansion going,"" Roth said.
Corporate earnings so far have been robust. With half of all S&P 500 companies reporting second-quarter results, about 76% have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
Backing the case further for a reduction in borrowing costs was data from the Commerce Department that showed U.S. consumer spending and prices rose moderately in June, pointing to slower economic growth and benign inflation.

 Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) 6.10% tumble weighed the most on the healthcare index (SPXHC). A couple of brokerages downgraded the stock after the drugmaker said on Monday it would spin off its off-patent drugs unit and merge it with Mylan (O:MYL).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration hopes civil aviation authorities around the world will decide at about the same time to allow the Boeing 737 MAX to resume flying, the agency told Congress on Tuesday in a letter seen by Reuters.
The FAA and other regulators grounded the plane in March after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people.
Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said in letters to Senators Susan Collins and Jack Reed that the agency ""hopes to achieve near simultaneous approval from the major civil aviation authorities around the world"" but added that every regulator will make its own determination.
""We are working with our colleagues from the European Union, Canada and Brazil to address their concerns,"" he wrote.
Collins will chair a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday that will feature four senior FAA officials, including Ali Bahrami, who oversees aviation safety.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told analysts last week he was confident the MAX would be back in service as early as October after a certification flight in ""the September time frame.""
Ryan Air (I:RYA) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Monday that he had been told that flight would be delayed until October. Boeing on Tuesday reiterated Muilenburg's recent comments.
Elwell said in his letter the FAA ""will lift the 737 MAX grounding order only when it is safe to do so.""
The MAX's return has been delayed as Chicago-based Boeing works to win approval for reprogrammed stall-prevention software and related training materials.
In late June, the FAA said it had identified a new risk as an agency pilot was running a flight simulator test seeking to intentionally activate the so-called MCAS stall-prevention system.
Boeing has said it is working on a fix to address the problem.
The FAA's Technical Advisory Board, made up of experts not involved in the original 737 MAX certification, is also reviewing the MCAS software update and training requirements.
The European Aviation Safety Agency sent FAA and Boeing a list of concerns it wanted addressed before the MAX re-enters service, people familiar with the matter said.
Since the crashes, federal prosecutors, the Transportation Department's inspector general, Congress and several blue-ribbon panels have been investigating how the FAA certifies new aircraft and its longstanding practice of delegating certification tasks to airplane manufacturers.
Elwell noted in his letter that on March 5 he created a new Aviation Safety Organization office on delegating authority. That office is in the process of selecting staff and is developing procedures ""to conduct this important mission. No substantive changes to the existing (delegation) program have been made as a result of standing up this office."""

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 01:41PM ET</span>","P&G posts strong sales, takes $8 billion Gillette writedown","By Richa Naidu and Soundarya J
(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co's (N:PG) quarterly revenue and adjusted profit beat Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, sending shares to a record-high even as the world's No.1 personal goods company took an $8 billion charge on its Gillette shaving business.
P&G reported a net loss of about $5.24 billion, or $2.12 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, due to an $8 billion non-cash writedown of Gillette. For the same period last year, P&G's net income was $1.89 billion, or 72 cents per share.
Cincinnati-based P&G, which operates in 80 countries, sells Gillette razors, gels and foams worldwide and said the writedown was due primarily to currency fluctuations - enduring strength in the U.S. economy in recent years has strengthened the dollar. The charge was also driven by more competition over the past three years and a shrinking market for blades and razors as consumers in developed markets shave less frequently. Net sales in the grooming business, which includes Gillette, have declined in 11 out of the last 12 quarters.
""Initial carrying values for Gillette were established nearly 14 years ago in 2005. ... New competitors have entered at prices below the category average,"" Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a call. 
P&G paid $57 billion in 2005 for Gillette, the world's No.1 shaving brand that is more than a century old. But in the 2010s technology altered the way consumers purchased razors, and relaxed social norms prompted men to shave less often, according to a Euromonitor report. In the past 5 years, the U.S. men's market for shaving products has shrunk by over 11%, the data firm said.
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2LOT0X1.
P&G has been cutting prices and investing in new products at its grooming business, hoping to claw back market share from upstart shaving brands bought by rivals, such as Unilever's (L:ULVR) Dollar Shave Club and Edgewell Personal Care's (N:EPC) recent acquisition of Harry's. 
For instance, P&G recently launched a razor called SkinGuard, designed for men with sensitive skin prone to irritation. Gillette's share of the U.S. men's razors and blades market slipped in 2018 while that of Harry's and  Unilever  grew, Euromonitor data showed.
P&G has signaled to analysts for some time that it might write down Gillette, given the market's issues; the charge is just an accounting expression of what we knew was happening to the business, Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.10 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.05 as strong demand for SK-II and Olay beauty products drove P&G's organic sales up 7%. Price hikes contributed 3 percentage points to organic sales growth, a closely watched metric which excludes items like acquisitions, divestitures and currency effects. Organic sales for all 10 of P&G's global categories grew.
Shares rose nearly 5% to a record high of $121.76, before paring gains to 4.2% at midday.
P&G, like other consumer goods companies, has been raising prices on many of its products to tackle soaring freight and raw material costs that have dented margins. Organic sales in P&G's beauty business rose 8%, boosted by demand for its super-premium SK-II brand and Olay skin care products. In the fabric and home care unit, the company's biggest business which sells Tide detergent and Febreze air fresheners, organic sales climbed 10%.
""Expectations were creeping higher into the print, but P&G far exceeded even the most optimistic expectations,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said, adding that P&G's organic sales growth of 7% was its strongest in 13 years.

The company's net sales rose 3.6% to $17.09 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $16.86 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

In a report published on Tuesday, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also said officials from the Indian companies - Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), ONGC (NS:ONGC) and GAIL (NS:GAIL) - may have been involved in improper procurement from Rolls-Royce.
Rolls-Royce provided engine spare parts to HAL for servicing gas turbines used by GAIL and ONGC, both of which are involved in the oil and gas sector, the report said.
The report said Rolls-Royce's appointment of Ashok Patni, director at a Singapore-based firm called Aashmore Private Ltd, as a commercial adviser in dealing with the three government-owned firms violated regulations and the arrangement may have been used for paying kickbacks to officials.
Rolls-Royce officials in London and its India president could not be immediately reached for comment. Spokesmen for GAIL and ONGC did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters. Gopal Sutar, a spokesman for HAL, declined to comment.
Aashmore and Patni could not be immediately reached for comment.
Between 2007 and 2011, Rolls-Royce conducted more than 200 transactions with the three companies for the supply of materials and spare parts, for which Aashmore was paid commission of at least 550 million rupees ($8 million), the CBI report said."

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 01:26PM ET</span>",Indian shadow bank DHFL submits debt restructuring plan to core lenders,"By Nupur Anand
(Reuters) - India's debt-laden shadow bank  Dewan Housing Finance  Ltd (DHFL) (NS:DWNH) has submitted a restructuring plan to its core committee of creditors (CoC), two sources involved in the matter said, adding that lead lenders were deliberating over the plan.
DHFL, the fourth-biggest housing finance company in India, has roughly 1 trillion rupees ($14.5 billion) of debt and is in the process of seeking lender approval on a restructuring designed to help it ride out a liquidy crunch and restart its lending business.
Several Indian non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), including DHFL, have been stung by an acute credit crunch sparked by the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services late last year.
The restructuring plan submitted by DHFL includes the founder's family reducing its stake and a restructuring of loans, said one of the sources aware of details of the plan.
The restructuring could include easier repayment terms, such as longer tenure and reduced interest rates, the source added.
Both the sources asked not to be named because details of the plan had not been made public. DHFL did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.
Of the total debt, DHFL owes banks approximately 380 billion rupees. The core lenders, including Union Bank (NS:UNBK) and  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI), are planning to call a meeting with the wider consortium of lenders in the first week of August to discuss the DHFL proposal, one of the sources said, adding that banks are not keen to inject any more capital.
SBI and Union Bank did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment outside business hours.
DHFL's core lender group consist of seven banks, with nearly two dozen other lenders in the wider consortium.
DHFL's plan is complicated by the need to secure approvals from mutual funds, insurers and pension funds that have also invested in the company's debt.
According to Indian central bank's regulations, three quarters of lenders by value of outstanding credit and 60% by number must agree on a restructuring plan for it to be cleared.
The Mumbai-based housing finance company is fairly confident of getting its rescue package approved soon, a company source had previously told Reuters. However, its auditors had recently raised red flags over the company's financial health, which could complicate its plans."

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 01:12PM ET</span>","Merck profit surges on strong sales of Keytruda, vaccines","By Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK) reported better-than-expected second-quarter results on Tuesday and raised its full-year earnings forecast on strong demand for its blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda and vaccines.
Merck shares rose 1.3% to $83.56 in afternoon trading.
Sales of Keytruda surged 58% to $2.63 billion in the quarter, ahead of Wall Street estimates for about $2.5 billion.
A run of positive clinical data for Keytruda and setbacks for its biggest rival - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (N:BMY) Opdivo - has led to a dominant position for Merck's drug as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer, the most lucrative oncology market.
Keytruda, Merck's most important growth driver, has racked up U.S. approvals to treat numerous cancer types since it was first approved for advanced melanoma in 2014. 
""We right now have built a wall of data that we feel very comfortable with,"" Chief Commercial Officer Franklin Clyburn said on a conference call with analysts.
Some investors have raised concerns about Merck over-reliance on Keytruda and have looked for a large deal to lessen that dependence, along the lines of AbbVie's (N:ABBV) $63 billion deal for Allergan Plc (N:AGN).
But analysts have forecast continued strong Keytruda growth for several years.
Merck Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier reiterated that Merck would focus on bolt-on deals ""across the spectrum in terms of size"" rather than a large, transformative acquisition.
Sales of Merck's Gardasil vaccine to prevent cancers associated with the human papillomavirus jumped 45.7% to $886 million, helped by both demand and a U.S. price increase. 
Overall vaccine sales rose 33% to $2 billion, also boosted by the company's measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot amid the worst U.S. measles outbreak since 1992. 
Sales of Merck's MMR and chicken pox vaccines rose 58% to $675 million in the quarter. Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis said he expects that business to grow, a forecast that is not based on the assumption of additional outbreaks.
The U.S. drugmaker increased its forecast for 2019 adjusted earnings, raising the midpoint by 16 cents. Merck now expects to earn between $4.84 and $4.94 per share, up from its prior view of $4.67 to $4.79.
Excluding items, Merck earned $1.30 per share, beating the average analysts' estimate by 14 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Merck said net income for the quarter rose to $2.67 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $1.71 billion, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier.

Sales rose 12.4% to $11.76 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $10.96 billion.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 01:11PM ET</span>","Air France-KLM buys smallest Airbus, retires largest","PARIS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM agreed to order 60 of Airbus's new A220 jets on Tuesday while announcing the retirement of the plane maker's A380 superjumbo from its fleet, as the Franco-Dutch airline group moves to improve fuel efficiency and costs.
In a boost for the A220 program acquired by Airbus from Bombardier last year, Air France-KLM's board approved 30 options and 30 purchase rights in addition to the firm orders worth an estimated $4.2 billion at unpublished list prices. The order was first reported by French daily La Tribune.
The company said the 150-seater A220 would ""improve Air France's environmental footprint"" as it gradually replaces its older A318 and A319 models at the smaller end of its fleet, starting in 2021.
Air France-KLM will also drop the A380 superjumbo entirely by the following year, the company said, adding that the current competitive environment ""limits the markets on which the A380 can be operated profitably"". Air France had previous disclosed plans to retire three of its 10 superjumbos.
The move comes five months after Airbus announced it was scrapping production of the world's largest airliner in response to lacklustre sales.
With two decks of spacious cabins and room for 544 people in standard layout, the A380 was designed to challenge Boeing's legendary 747 but failed to take hold as airlines backed a new generation of smaller, more nimble jets.
Air France-KLM will ""examine the possible options for the replacement of these planes with new-generation aircraft now available on the market,"" the company said.
Following the A380's demise, Airbus's arch-rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) is hoping its new twin-aisle 777X jet may scoop up more orders as it prepares to enter service next year."

ROME/MILAN (Reuters) - The role of French bank  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) is presenting a hurdle to efforts by Salini  Impregilo  (MI:SALI) to create an Italian construction champion, two sources close to the matter said.
Salini, Italy's biggest building company, is looking to secure the backing of state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) for its efforts to revive the country's moribund construction industry.
But CDP, expected to inject up to 250 million euros ($279 million) in the ""Progetto Italia"" plan, is concerned about shares in the family holding Salini Costruttori pledged to Natixis as collateral for a loan, the source said.
The source did not specify how many shares were involved in the Natixis margin loan deal but said the number could be significant. Salini Costruttori owns around 67% of the listed builder.
The source said CDP was worried about backing a project to create a national player that could be influenced by a French investor. Rome is keen to rescue an ailing sector that remains a major employer and driver for ambitious infrastructure plans.
In a letter sent to Salini dated July 15 and seen by Reuters, CDP said it was important that ""ties currently existing on Salini shares held by Salini Costruttori be revised to the satisfaction of (CDP)"", but gave no further details.
Salini, which has worked on projects ranging from expansion of the Panama Canal to a new subway line in Saudi Arabia, is launching a takeover bid for troubled rival  Astaldi  (MI:AST) as a first step in a broader 1.6 billion euro ($1.8 billion) plan to consolidate the industry and create a business that can compete globally.
FRENCH FACTOR
Corporate France has been the biggest overseas investor in Italian companies over the past decade with deals totaling $43.3 billion, Refinitiv data shows.
Some have been closely scrutinised by Rome, worried over the vulnerability of corporate champions such as  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT), in which CDP took a direct holding after  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) built a controlling stake.
Last month  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) abandoned its $35 billion merger offer for  Renault  (PA:RENA), blaming French politics.
Salini, Natixis and CDP declined to comment.
Salini has said its offer for Astaldi is conditional on bagging funding commitments by Aug. 1 from CDP and banks.
Media reports have said the deadline could be pushed back to allow more time to find a solution on Natixis and iron out a few other outstanding issues such as governance.
""There are still some issues to be closed as is normal in such a complex and important deal,"" another source familiar with the talks said, adding discussions were ongoing.
Salini, whose long-standing CEO Pietro Salini has been a driving force behind the consolidation push, made no mention of its Project Italy plans in first half results released on Tuesday.
CDP, which is almost 83% state owned, has a board meeting scheduled for Thursday."

Shares of the U.S. photocopier maker were down 3.5% at $32.72 in trading around noon.
Xerox scrapped a complex deal last year to merge with Japan's Fujifilm Holdings Corp (T:4901) after it ran into strong opposition from activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.
Since then, the company has taken initiatives to streamline its business under the new management led by Chief Executive Officer John Visentin, an Icahn appointee.
Xerox now expects 2019 revenue to fall 6%, compared with a 5% decline it had estimated earlier.
Total revenue for the second quarter fell nearly 9% to $2.29 billion, as businesses continue to cut spending on printers and photocopiers. 
Analysts had expected revenue of $2.32 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
""Results were due to weaker economic conditions in Western Europe and certain developing markets and continued operational impacts in the United States we identified last quarter, albeit improving as the quarter went on,"" Visentin said on a post earnings call with analysts. 
Net income attributable to Xerox rose to $181 million, or 77 cents per share, in the three months ended June 30, from $112 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned 99 cents per share, above estimates of 88 cents.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland scrapped a 1.8 million Swiss franc ($1.8 million) sponsorship deal with Philip Morris International (N:PM) for the country's pavilion at Expo 2020 in Dubai after being widely criticized for taking tobacco money to promote its image abroad.
Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis made the decision so as ""not to undermine the primary objective of the Swiss presence in Dubai, which is to convey a positive image of Switzerland"", the foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
""After examining the case, he decided that the work on this sponsorship should not be continued.""
The World Health Organization (WHO) had criticized the deal for violating agreements it had struck over Expo sponsorships.
Eight Swiss universities offering health education also told Cassis, a medical doctor, in a letter last week that taking money from a cigarette maker contradicted ethical principles.
Cassis has ordered revisions to the ministry's sponsorship policy by the end of the year to prevent similar situations from re-occurring.
Philip Morris, which during the controversy had emphasized its efforts to promote heated tobacco products as an alternative to traditional smoking, said it was disappointed.
""We regret not only this decision, but also the circumstance that the foreign minister was brought into this position by activists and organizations, especially since these actors say they want to end smoking but apparently don't have any interest in an open dialogue about grounded science, innovation and better alternatives for smokers,"" it said in a statement.
The WHO, in a report on the global tobacco epidemic, said last week that e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products were not helping fight cancer.
The Geneva-based group said Philip Morris's ""Unsmoke"" campaign aimed to ensure tobacco remained socially acceptable, while confusing consumers about products with toxic emissions and unknown health effects."
1213,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>","France sees red over Trump wine tax threat, cheaper vintages seen worst hit","By Regis Duvignau and Michel Rose
BORDEAUX/PARIS (Reuters) - American lovers of fine French wine are likely to keep stocking their cellars and uncorking bottles despite U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose a tax in a potential new trade war. But makers of cheaper French vintages are concerned.
France's premier wines sell for hundreds of dollars a bottle and are often bought for their prestige as much as their taste, industry experts say, so a U.S. tariff will have less of an impact on demand.
But consumers of less expensive wines can readily switch to other nations' wares in the quest for better value quaff. 
Trump raised the prospect of tariffs in retaliation for a planned digital services tax by France, and he criticized President Emmanuel Macron's for what he called ""foolishness"".
While Macron's own response has been restrained, other French ministers have hit back. 
Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume denounced Trump's decision as ""completely moronic"".
""American wine is not better than French wine,"" he said. 
His cabinet colleague, junior tech minister Cedric O, tweeted: ""Looks like president Trump doesn't know much about wine. Nor about the principles of international law.""
Trump's threat is a headache for Macron ahead of a summit of G7 leaders in Biarritz next month and comes after France's parliament approved legislation designed at making tech companies such as Google (O:GOOGL), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Facebook (O:FB) pay more tax.
The so-called ""GAFAs"", as they are known in France, are often accused of unfairly competing with local businesses by booking profits in low-tax countries like Ireland, no matter where the revenue originates.
While wine is France's second-biggest export after aerospace, some experts say the fact that Americans mostly import prestige wines from Burgundy or Bordeaux which are less sensitive to higher price tags should cushion the blow.
""When you look into the details, you realize America is the first export market in value terms, but not in volume,"" Eric Morain, a lawyer who specializes in the wine sector, told Reuters.
""That means Americans drink French wines that are already expensive. I don't think someone who's able to buy a bottle for $100 or $150 will think twice before buying one at $180 or $200,"" he said.
Germany is France's top export market in terms of volume sold with 2.18 million hectolitres, ahead of the United States.
In value terms, the United States comes first, accounting for 18 percent of French wine exports and worth 1.7 billion euros ($1.90 billion), up almost a third over the past five years.
BAD NEWS
In France's wine regions however, exporters expressed greater concern. 
Near Bordeaux, Olivier Fleury, the owner of the middle-market Chateau du Pavillon winery at Sainte-Croix du Mont, was bracing for bad news. He exports half of the million bottles he produces every year, with half of that going to the United States alone. 
""Even a few dollars per bottle would change things for us, our products will simply disappear from the shelves,"" he told Reuters. His wine sells for between $18 and $60 in the United States.
Trump made his threat as the lower euro was helping French wines recover market share after years of stronger competition from Chilean and Argentine wines.
""Americans are big producers themselves, they won't struggle to replace Bordeaux wines which were only just recovering their positions. Americans will buy something else,"" Fleury added.
Others were hoping American consumers' increasing taste for foreign wines - the United State is the world's largest wine importer and, since 2011, the largest wine consumer - will mean trade will continue to flow across the Atlantic.
""It would be bad news for us,"" said Christian Paly, the head of the Tavel cooperative in the southern Gard region, which mostly produces rosé, an increasingly popular choice in the United States. The cooperative's wines sell at $20-25 there. 

""But Americans can't do without French wine altogether. It would slow us down but it wouldn't be a disaster,"" he told France 3 television.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 11:56AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China to inspect Argentine crushers, could unlock No. 1 soymeal market","By Hugh Bronstein
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A Chinese delegation is set to visit Argentina in August to inspect soymeal crushing plants, Argentine government and industry officials told Reuters, a key step as the South American country looks to open up exports of processed soy to the world's No. 1 consumer.
Argentina, the top global soymeal exporter, has tried for years to break into the China market, the biggest consumer of the meal which it uses to feed its giant hog herd. China, with its own crushing industry to protect, has steadfastly resisted.
Global trade uncertainties - including pessimism about U.S.-China negotiations that start on Tuesday in Shanghai - has, however, strengthened Argentina's hand, grain traders said, prompting China to expand its soymeal import options.
""We will have a visit of Chinese officials as part of the process of pursuing the objective of exporting soybean meal to China,"" Santiago del Solar, chief of staff to Argentina's Agriculture Secretary, told Reuters.
China is the No. 1 buyer of Argentine soybeans but does not import any of its processed meal, which could be used to help feed the world's biggest hog heard as consumers in the country shift toward a diet of meal-fed pork and poultry.
""Argentina has spent 20 years trying to gain access to the Chinese soymeal market. In all that time, this is the first Chinese trade mission to Argentina specifically to discuss soymeal,"" Gustavo Idigoras, president of Argentina's CIARA-CEC chamber of grains exporting companies, said in an interview.
He added Chinese customs inspectors would arrive on Aug. 18 for a two-week trip and visit crushing plants operated by eight firms including  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG), Vicentin,  Molinos Agro  SA (BA:MOLA), Louis Dreyfus Corp [LOUDR.UL], Cargill Inc (CARG.UL).
""It makes sense for the world's biggest and most efficient soymeal exporter to sell to the world's biggest consumer.""
The firms did not immediately respond or declined to comment.
The meal manufactured in the giant crushing plants that dot the banks of Argentina's Parana River, clustered around the country's main grains hub of Rosario, is exported mostly to Southeast Asia, Europe and Northern Africa. China imports only small amounts of soymeal currently, none of it from Argentina.
(GRAPHIC - Argentina soy png: https://tmsnrt.rs/2MzR1pp)
TRADE WAR SILVER LINING
The mission comes at a time when U.S. exporters are facing troubles getting farm goods approved by China due to the trade war raging between Washington and Beijing, which traders said may favor Argentina.
""This is a troubled time for the U.S.-China trade relationship. Maybe that's an opportunity for Argentina, specifically regarding value-added products like soymeal,"" said an executive at one of the Argentine crushing plants slated to be inspected. He asked not to be named.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday slammed what he called a ""ripoff"" trade deal with the Chinese, and warned the world's No. 2 economy against waiting out his first term in office to finalize any new deal.
""I think this time, China really feels the crisis and wants to guarantee (soymeal) supplies,"" said a Beijing-based grains trader on condition of anonymity. Another China trader said the impact would be less immediate, but was more a ""back-up plan"" for China given the trade dispute.
To be sure, China will remain overall much more focused on Argentine soybeans than meal. Chinese buyers currently buy over 70% of Argentina's total exports of raw beans.
Idigoras said he was confident that China would soon open the door to Argentine soymeal, as a massive dietary shift away from rice and toward protein in the Asian country increased demand for livestock feed.
He added it would likely take over six months following the mission for any exports, during which time inspectors would have to prepare a report from the trip regarding approvals and soymeal from each plant would have to be registered in China.
He estimated a first cargo would be around 35,000 tonnes.
""In March the Chinese vice minister of food security told me that the only questions remaining about Argentine soymeal were of price and quality,"" Idigoras said. ""We offer the best of both, so we are very confident the mission will be a success."""
1216,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 11:49AM ET</span>",Ralph Lauren quarterly results beat on demand in North America,"By Nivedita Balu and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - Ralph Lauren Corp (N:RL) said on Tuesday it expects full-year sales in North America to be pressured by a tough retail environment and weakness in spending by foreign tourists, overshadowing upbeat quarterly earnings and sending its shares down about 4%.
The fashion house, like other apparel companies, is trying to revive growth after years of heavy discounting and a strategy of flooding the market with its lower-end goods.
The New York-based company has launched limited edition apparel, invested heavily in new marketing strategies and partnered with professional golfer Justin Thomas for the sporting season to reinvigorate sales of core products like its Polo shirts.
But fierce competition in the apparel industry and the popularity of online shopping have weighed on fashion houses, which rely heavily on brick-and-mortar stores for a major chunk of their sales.
Ralph Lauren has taken a slightly more cautious view of the retail environment for the year ahead and continues to see challenges with brick-and-mortar traffic, including foreign tourist volatility, Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet said on a post-earnings call with analysts.
Wholesale business was the biggest driver of the company's 3.1% growth in revenue in North America in the quarter, which was offset by weaker-than-expected retail same-store sales.
Internationally, the company continued to perform well, with revenue rising 1.5% in Europe and 4.3% in Asia.
""We expect continued strength in our international businesses and a more challenging outlook for North America,"" Chief Financial officer Jane Nielsen said.
Wall Street remains squarely focused on the retailer's North American market performance, which in large part speaks to why shares of the company reversed course to fall about 4% after rising about 6% in trading before the bell, analysts said.
""The market feels like North America is a leading indicator for the business in the other parts of the world,"" UBS analyst Jay Sole said.
""People are concerned that market (North America), which is around half the business, is going to weigh on the company's ability to grow.""
For the second quarter, the company forecast net revenue to rise by about 1% on a constant currency basis and expects a stronger dollar to pressure revenue growth by about 90 to 100 basis points.
The company maintained its revenue forecast for the rest of the year. 
Net income rose to $117.1 million, or $1.47 per share, in the first quarter ended June 29 from $109 million, or $1.31 per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.77 per share, while net revenue rose to $1.43 billion.

(Reuters) - Shares in meat alternatives company Beyond Meat (O:BYND) slid on Tuesday, a day after the company known for its pea-based burgers and sausages announced a stock offering plan to raise capital just three months after going public.
Beyond Meat shares were down 10% at $199 in late morning trade on Nasdaq. The company on Monday said 3.25 million new shares would be issued, including 3 million shares from selling stockholders.
The El Segundo, California-based company said proceeds from the 250,000 shares offered will be used to expand Beyond Meat's manufacturing facilities and pay for marketing investments.
Beyond Meat's shares have surged more than 780% since its May IPO as the company's meat alternatives entered the menus of restaurants such as Carl's Jr and hit the shelves of grocers, including  Kroger Co  (N:KR).
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in a note on Monday said Beyond Meat's growth opportunity and strong management were already reflected in the company's valuation.
Beyond Meat on Monday beat Wall Street's estimate for revenue in the three months ended June 29, reporting $67.3 million in second-quarter sales. It expects $240 million in 2019 net revenue, up from $210 million it forecast just last month.
Alexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein, said plant-based meat alternatives had significant growth potential, with Beyond Meat being well-positioned as one of the industry's frontrunners.
According to a research report by Mintel, some 40% of U.S. consumers are looking to add more plant-based protein to their diet, amid growing concerns about health risks from eating meat, animal welfare and the environmental hazards of intensive animal farming.
But the company is seeing competition from Impossible Foods, another California plant-based burger startup, and meat companies like  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and Perdue Foods, which now offer meat protein products mixed with plants."

The drugmaker in a regulatory filing on Monday disclosed that it had reached an agreement-in-principle with the SEC's enforcement staff to resolve the investigation that dated back to 2016. Mylan said it will neither admit nor deny wrongdoing as part of the accord. The EpiPen, which Mylan acquired in 2007, is a handheld device that treats life-threatening allergic reactions by automatically injecting a dose of epinephrine.
Mylan came under fire in 2016 after raising the price of a pair of EpiPens to $600, from $100 in 2008, enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing U.S. debate over the high cost of prescription medicines.
In 2017, the drugmaker finalized a $465 million settlement resolving U.S. Justice Department claims it overcharged the government for EpiPen.
The deal resolved claims that Mylan avoided higher rebates to state Medicaid programs by misclassifying EpiPen as a generic product, even though it was marketed and priced as a brand-name product.
In 2016, Mylan revealed the SEC had launched its own investigation related to EpiPen and sought copies of its communications with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and documents related to the Medicaid rebate program.
Mylan said the settlement with the SEC is subject to approval by the agency's commissioners.
Separately on Monday, Mylan confirmed that it would merge with  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) off-patent branded drugs unit, a move that will help it diversify its business as it continues to be pressured by falling prices of generic drugs in the United States.
Shares of generic drugmakers have suffered over the past several years and, this year alone, Mylan shares had lost one-third of their value through Friday, before news broke of the Pfizer tie-up.
The companies are also in talks to transfer a Pfizer manufacturing unit that makes EpiPen to the newly created business, although it remains unclear whether this will address an ongoing shortage of the product."

Earlier, Bayer said the number of U.S. plaintiffs blaming Roundup and other glyphosate-based weedkillers for their cancer continued to rise by 5,000 to 18,400, as a litigation wave that has crushed the group's market value showed no sign of letting up.

LONDON (Reuters) - A snarling warning from U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of trade talks with China rattled stock markets on Tuesday, as brewing no-deal Brexit worries also roughed up the pound and Irish bonds again.
With the Federal Reserve widely expected to deliver on Wednesday its first cut in U.S. rates since the financial crisis and plenty of European traders already on beach breaks, it was not supposed to be so stormy. 
But Europe's already flailing big bourses buckled badly (GDAXI) [LIVE/] along with Wall Street futures (N) as Trump warned China against trying to wait out his first term in office to finalize a trade deal.
It set the tone for a new round of U.S-China talks in Shanghai and as if that was not tough enough, Trump also trolled Beijing for its economy doing ""very badly"" for good measure.
Germany's DAX and carmakers took the main hit, both slumping around 2% in what could be Frankfurt's worst day since February. S&P 500 and Dow futures also dropped around 0.5% with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) results due after the bell also in focus. (N) [LIVE/]
""The problem with them (China) waiting,"" Trump tweeted ""is that if & when I win (2020 election), the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now ... or no deal at all."" 
Woes were also continuing for the pound following its worst day of the year so far. 
It took another 0.5% swoon against all the major currencies after Monday had seen new UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson call his predecessor's Brexit plans dead and new foreign minister and former Brexit chief, Dominic Raab, label the European Union ""stubborn"".
Sterling  fell as far as $1.2120, its lowest against the dollar since March 2017. It did eventually find some support but not before it had also dropped to its weakest against the euro since Sept 2017 too as it hit 91.85 pence.
Options markets were still pointing to more pain as well. Three-month implied volatility, a contract that expires just before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, jumped to over 11 vols, the highest since before March 29, the original date for Britain to leave the European Union.
""The pound is in a very precarious state, it is as simple as that,"" said TD Securities' European head of currency strategy Ned Rumpeltin.
""We are now in a different regime,"" he said, referring to Johnson's explicit agenda of taking Britain out of the EU, whether or not transitional trading agreements are in place. 
It was not just sterling reeling either. 
Irish government bond yield spreads over Germany hit their widest levels in over a month at 59 basis points, on worries about the damage a no-deal Brexit would do to Ireland's economy.
Other euro zone government bond yields were holding near recent lows ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting which is expected to deliver a 25 basis point rate cut on Wednesday and potentially signal more on the way.
Germany's 10-year government bond yield (DE10YT=RR) was hovering near the minus 0.40% mark. [GVD/EUR]

FED AHEAD
European shares had also slipped on grim forecasts from German chemicals and drugs giant Bayer (DE:BAYGN) and airline Lufthansa, and despite some early pound-induced resistance even London's blue-chip FTSE index (FTSE) could stay out of the red. (EU)
With concerns about global growth still bubbling among investors, a GfK survey also showed German consumer morale worsening for the third month in a row heading into August as trade disputes bit in Europe's biggest exporter.
Asia in contrast had been a bit more positive overnight. 
Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 0.4%, showing limited reaction to the Bank of Japan's widely anticipated decision to stand pat on monetary policy. Shanghai (SSEC) rose 0.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged up 0.2%. 
Australian stocks (AXJO) stole the glory again though with another record high, as buoyant mining shares added to tech-driven gains the previous day. 
The BOJ added that it would ease policy again ""without hesitation"" if the economy loses momentum for achieving the central bank's 2% inflation target. 
It set investors up nicely for Wednesday Fed decision on its first rate cut in over a decade. 
Zhiwei Ren, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management said he was in the camp expecting a 25 basis point cut, though there was a chance of 50 basis points. 
""I probably just buy some call options on the S&P 500,"" to hedge in case of the 50 bps move, Ren said.
But ""It is hard to reconcile this kind of aggressive cut with the current economic data... If you look at the data and the earning reports the (U.S.) consumer is very strong.""
Among commodities, crude oil prices extended the previous day's gains, with the Fed's expected easing fuelling optimism that it would boost the economy and fuel demand in the world's biggest oil consumer. [O/R]

1223,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 09:54AM ET</span>","Eskom Record Loss Not as Huge as Forecast, Spurring Bond Rally","(Bloomberg) -- Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., South Africa’s debt-ridden power utility, reported a record annual loss of 20.7 billion rand ($1.46 billion), but its bonds rallied on optimism that it is starting to stem the bleeding.
Eskom’s loss for the year through March widened from 2.3 billion rand the year before as power sales generated insufficient income to cover its operating costs and interest payments. The utility, which generates about 95% of the nation’s electricity, had amassed net debt of 430.8 billion rand at the end of the financial year and the government is giving it a 128 billion-rand bailout over the next three fiscal years to keep it afloat.
Still, the loss was lower than expectations, after Anton Eberhard, who sits on a government team that’s advising on a rescue plan for Eskom, told a conference in Lisbon last month the company lost at least 25 billion rand.
The rand fluctuated between gains and losses, while yields on Eskom’s dollar bonds fell for the first time in seven days, with the rate on debt due 2021 dropping six basis points to 5.91% by 2:44 p.m. in Johannesburg.
While the results were expected, they were nonetheless “unfavorable,” Eskom Chairman Jabu Mabuza told reporters at the party’s headquarters in Johannesburg.
The release of the results comes on the eve of Phakamani Hadebe’s departure as chief executive officer -- he announced he was quitting two months ago because he said the “unimaginable demands” of the job were taking a toll on his health. Mabuza will also take on the role of acting CEO while a permanent replacement is sought, a process the utility said will be concluded within three months.
The delayed appointment, along with the stalled announcement of a chief restructuring officer to oversee plans to split Eskom into three operating units and restructure its debt, illustrates the difficulties the government has faced in recruiting suitably qualified and politically acceptable candidates to turn the utility around.
Besides not selling enough power, Eskom has thousands more workers than it says it needs and is confronting massive cost overruns at two new partially completed coal-fired plants. The nation’s powerful labor unions, which played a key role in helping President Cyril Ramaphosa win power, oppose staff cuts and breaking it up into generation, distribution and transmission units under a state holding company, fearing that will be a precursor to privatization.

1224,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 09:53AM ET</span>","Air Canada Removes 737 Max Flights Until 2020, Joining Southwest","(Bloomberg) -- Air Canada has removed the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Max from its schedule until January pending regulatory approvals, joining Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co. in scrapping plans for flights of the jetliner into 2020.
Canada’s largest carrier said the grounded jets will reduce capacity and curb earnings growth in the third quarter, even as the company posted profit that beat analysts’ estimates for the second quarter.
“The impact of the Boeing 737 Max grounding will be felt more acutely in our very busy summer period,” Calin Rovinescu, president and chief executive officer of Air Canada said in an earnings statement Tuesday. The removal of Boeing 737 Max until at least Jan. 8 “reflects our prudent approach to scheduling, giving customers certainty when booking their fall and especially their winter holiday travel.”
The Montreal-based airline said that third-quarter projected capacity is expected to fall about 2% compared with the same period in 2018, contrasting the originally planned increase of about 3%. Third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about 5%, short of analysts’ estimates.
The firm has no visibility on reliable timing for the return to service of the aircraft but says it would look for opportunities to have some enter the fleet for either replacement flying or as backups if the aircraft are returned to service earlier, Rovinescu said.
Airlines around the world are feeling the effects of the resulting fallout from the global ban on  Boeing Co .’s 737 Max, following two crashes that killed 346 people. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) warned that profit this year would take a $400 million hit while Southwest Airlines removed the jet from its schedule into next year. The announcements came after Boeing said it would take a $5.6 billion pretax charge to compensate Max customers and that it might need to stop output of the narrow-body jet.

Trump said in a series of tweets that China is not keeping its promise to buy U.S. agricultural goods, adding “that is the problem with China, they just don’t come through.”
Chinese officials have never confirmed making any such promise, although reports from the last round of talks suggested that it was part of a quid pro quo that also included the dropping of U.S. tariffs on imports from China.

The comments came ahead of the start of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting, where a rate cut of 25 basis points on Wednesday is fully priced in.

1226,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 09:41AM ET</span>",Big British banks must publish 'living wills' in 2021,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's major banks, such as  Barclays  (L:BARC) and HSBC (L:HSBA), will have to tell investors in 2021 if they can be closed down without creating havoc in financial markets, the Bank of England said on Tuesday.
A decade after Britain had to rescue Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) and Lloyds (L:LLOY) during the 2007-09 financial crisis, large British banks will have to present ""living wills"" which show they can be resolved in an orderly way so that customer deposits and some core services are unaffected.
""Increased transparency about the resolution regime is in the public's interest and also incentivises firms to make further progress on their resolvability,"" BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said in a statement.
The BoE has set a 2022 target for major banks to be resolvable, including requirements for them to hold special debt that can replenish capital buffers.
Under the new framework the BoE published on Tuesday, banks with retail deposits of more than 50 billion pounds ($61 billion) must publicly disclose summaries on their own resolvability assessments or ""living wills"" by June 2021.
At the same time, the BoE will publish this assessment for the major UK banks, setting out any factors that could prevent orderly resolvability by the 2022 target date.
The Bank intends to publish the assessments every two years to show that the banks are no longer ""too big to fail"", keeping taxpayers off the hook in the next crisis.
Although not a formal pass or fail, markets could pile pressure on banks required to take further action to meet the resolvability target.
Banks must also nominate a senior manager responsible for compliance with the new framework or face a ban or fine.
Simon Hills, director of prudential policy at UK Finance, which represents banks, said in response to the BoE requirements that the banking system had been fundamentally reformed to ensure that taxpayers never had to bail out a bank again.
The United States already requires banks to say if they are resolvable. But in April, the Federal Reserve proposed a more relaxed reporting schedule that would permit banks to submit full plans less frequently.
The euro zone has said it is ""neutral"" for now on asking banks to publish living wills.
""Perhaps Brexit means that the UK is anxious to be on the front foot in demonstrating the robustness of its financial system,” said Ash Saluja, head of financial services at law firm CMS.
British banks already hold multiples of the amount of capital than before the crisis, along with special loss-absorbing debt, meaning they are less likely to reach a situation where they have to be closed down."

(Reuters) - Sportswear maker  Under Armour  Inc (N:UA) (N:UAA) on Tuesday cut its full-year revenue forecast for North America, its biggest market, as it suffered in the face of a strong performance by bigger rivals  Nike  and Adidas, sending its share down 11%.
Since its founding in 1996, Under Armour has had an uphill battle to stand out in an industry that stalwarts Nike Inc (N:NKE) and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGn) have dominated for decades.
Celebrity endorsements and the company's aggressive use of social media and the popularity of its sweat-proof apparel have helped, led by the appeal to younger consumers of its partnership with basketball MVP Steph Curry.
While Nike posted a 7% rise in North America revenue in the quarter ended May, sales for Under Armour fell 3% to $816 million, bigger than the 1.6% drop predicted by a consensus of analysts drawn up by brokerage Bernstein.
A Refinitiv consensus taking in forecasts of just three stock analysts had expected a 1.1% decline.
""We see little evidence of a material pick up in the way consumers, and especially women consumers, see Under Armour,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director at research firm GlobalData.
""With the sports apparel space becoming increasingly crowded, Under Armour needs to carve out a more distinct and edgy position.""
The Baltimore-based firm said it now expected a slight decline in North America revenue for fiscal 2019 compared with a prior forecast of flat revenue. Still it stuck to its overall growth target on higher demand for shoes and apparel abroad.
The company has been spending more to open stores and improve its online offerings in international markets. These efforts helped Under Armour post growth in its Europe and Asia Pacific markets.
It has seen some success with the launch of products including Curry sneaker, HOVR shoes and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's workout line Project Rock, but did not break out sales of particular lines in its main quarterly report.
The company's net loss narrowed to $17.3 million, or 4 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30 from $95.5 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding certain items, Under Armour posted a loss of 3 cents per share, while analysts were expecting a loss of 5 cents.
Net revenue rose to $1.19 billion from $1.17 billion, roughly in line with analysts' expectation.
Class A common shares of the Baltimore-based company have gained 55% so far this year."

The drugmaker has been working to retain its dominant position in the diabetes market, as its top-sellers, including insulin injection Humalog, lose market share to rivals, amid political scrutiny over soaring healthcare costs.
Lilly is also banking on its newer treatments such as Emgality, which won U.S. approval to treat migraine last year and has been touted as a growth driver for Lilly.
Emgality brought in sales of $34.3 million in the three months ended June 30, missing analysts' estimate of $42.3 million for a second straight quarter. 
Sales of Trulicity rose about 32% to $1.03 billion in the second quarter, just above the average analyst estimate of $1.02 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The drug accounted for nearly a fifth of Lilly's total sales. 
In contrast, revenue from Humalog, which included the cut-price version of the drug, fell 12% to $677.6 million.
Lilly in March agreed to offer a half-priced version of Humalog after coming under intense pressure from U.S. politicians to lower drug costs. 
The company raised its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $5.67 to $5.77 per share from its prior range of $5.60 to $5.70 per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of $5.66 per share.
However, revenue from the United States was nearly flat at $3.25 billion, mainly due to lower prices even as volumes rose. 
Total revenue rose to $5.64 billion from $5.59 billion, above estimates of $5.59 billion.
Lilly had warned in April that its revenue growth will be hit by its programs that allow new patients to try new drugs at little or no cost. 
The drugmaker posted net income of $1.33 billion, or $1.44 per share, in the latest quarter.
Excluding items, Lilly earned $1.50 per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.45 per share.
Separately, the company released late-stage study results, which showed that Lilly's combination therapy that includes its cancer treatment, Verzenio, helped women with certain types of advanced breast cancer live longer.
Verzenio competes with  Novartis  AG's (S:NOVN) Kisqali and  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) Ibrance. The therapy brought in slightly better-than-expected sales of $133.9 million during the quarter.

Shares of the company rose 1% to $109.75 in trading before the bell.

(Reuters) - Frustrated by high fees and uninspiring returns, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and other big institutional investors are demanding U.S. activist hedge funds be more transparent about their investment ideas and charge less, investors and fund managers say. 
Activist hedge funds push for changes at companies, ranging from ousting management and board directors to buying back stock and divesting non-core assets. Traditionally they have used capital from their total pool of investor money to build stakes in companies, without telling clients in advance what their targets and strategy will be. 
They then go ""active"" and call for changes in some of the companies they invest in, but charge the same fees for all the money that investors place with them. 
Now, institutional investors are increasingly pressuring the hedge fund managers to raise separate pots of capital for each company they target through so-called special purpose vehicles, and have been able to drive down how much they pay for investment gains.
Fund managers now have to bring their best ideas, fully formed and described in detail in glossy pitch books, outlining to their investors exactly how they plan to drive up a company's stock.
""This structure lets us look at dozens of transactions and only invest in a manager's very best ideas,"" said Gregg Hymowitz, chief executive officer of EnTrust Global, one of the largest investors in special purpose vehicles raised by activist hedge funds. ""For lower fees and with an increased level of transparency, we can specifically target only the highest-conviction ideas of our partners.""
There is no industrywide data on the proliferation of these pools of capital, often referred to as co-investments or sidecars, because fundraising is confidential, but investors and fund managers said their use is growing. 
Some of the industry's most prominent activists, including Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management LP, Keith Meister's Corvex Management LP and Glenn Welling's Engaged Capital LLC, are increasingly relying on special purpose vehicles to raise money. Smaller players like J. Daniel Plants' Voce Capital Management are also turning more to co-investments for their campaigns.
The fund managers either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment. 
Electronics maker Sony Corp (T:6758), retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (O:BBBY), building materials producer  Eagle Materials Inc  (N:EXP), insurance company Argo Group International Holdings (N:ARGO) and specialty chemicals provider Ashland Global Holdings Inc (N:ASH) are among the companies that were targets of campaigns mounted by activist hedge funds through co-investments, investors said. 
The companies either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.
The proliferation of special purpose vehicles underscores how activist hedge funds, run by some of the biggest personalities in the industry, have lost some of their star power, as returns and assets under management have sagged amid increasing competition and misplaced bets on overvalued companies. 
""Previously fund managers were almost always in the driver's seat. That has changed for many now,"" said Eleazer Klein, a partner at law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel, who advises activist investors. 
Last year activists lost 10.4% on average, far more than the hedge fund industry's average 5% drop, according to data from research firm Hedge Fund Research. Assets under management shrunk by 16% from their peak in 2015 to $146 billion at the end of last year. Activist hedge funds are performing better this year, returning 10.1% in the first six months of 2019, according to HFR data.As demand for activist funds dried up at a time investors wanted less exposure to stocks, they suddenly had significantly more power to dictate terms in return for their multi-million-dollar investments. Managers who needed the cash were ready to compromise on fees.
Hedge funds have traditionally charged a 2% management fee and 20% of the gains. Co-investments often charge no management fees and require investors to pay only 10% of the profits. In addition, fees, instead of being collected annually, are collected only at the end of the investment period, which tends to be longer, between three and five years, managers and investors said.
CURBING ABILITY TO MOVE AT WILL 
Some fund managers complain that the shift in the fundraising model is cumbersome and limits their ability to target companies when they are ready and to do so in secret.
It can also raise the risk of a leak that can drive up a target's stock price and give the target an opportunity to line up defenses. 
Sony, for example, was able to hire investment bankers and prepare its strategy weeks before Daniel Loeb's Third Point approached it with its demands, after Reuters reported in April that the hedge fund was raising a special purpose vehicle to target the Japanese company, according to people familiar with the matter.
But special purpose vehicles have advantages, too, giving activists access to more cash than they normally would be able to deploy, allowing them to go after bigger companies. 
In the case of Sony, Third Point built a $1.5 billion stake with the help of co-investment, a big bet that would have run afoul of rules of how much money Loeb could allocate to a particular bet in his main $15 billion fund, according to investors.
Third Point did not respond to a request for comment. Sony declined to comment. 

""Fund managers find it an efficient way to raise capital, it is a win-win,"" said Corvex's Meister, who has raised several billion dollars for co-investments over the last years.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 08:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: India's capital bans AB InBev for three years for alleged tax evasion,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's capital city has banned the world's largest brewer,  Anheuser-Busch InBev , from selling its products in the key New Delhi market for 3 years for allegedly evading local taxes, government orders seen by Reuters showed.
The city government orders from earlier this month followed a 3-year investigation which found that beer maker SABMiller (LON:SAB) - acquired by AB InBev (BR:ABI) in 2016 for around $100 billion - used duplicate barcodes on its beer bottles supplied to city retailers that year, allowing it to pay lower levies.
AB InBev said in a statement it denied the Delhi government's allegations and would appeal against the order.
""The barcodes were being duplicated by ... SABMiller and supplied to the retail outlets to evade payment of excise duty,"" said a 19-page order, dated July 16, which detailed the findings.
In a second order last week, the Delhi city authority said that AB InBev should be put on a ""blacklist"" for three years. It also called for the sealing of two of AB InBev's warehouses in the capital city, an action that a senior Delhi government official told Reuters on Tuesday had already been completed.
""This means the company is debarred from Delhi market for all purposes, unless they appeal against this,"" said the official, adding that no fresh stock of AB InBev beer brands can be sold at liquor shops or restaurants.
Neither of the orders had been previously reported.
AB InBev, which counts popular beer brands such as Budweiser, Hoegaarden and Stella Artois in its portfolio, told Reuters the Delhi government's allegations related to operations of SABMiller prior to its takeover, and it looked forward to receiving a fair hearing on the matter.
""Integrity and ethics are part of our core values ... (We) look forward to presenting our views in full cooperation with the excise appellate process,"" a company spokesman said.
AB InBev is the second biggest player in India's $7 billion beer market, accounting for a 17.5 percent market share, according to research firm IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.
Though separate local market share figures were not available, industry executives said the Delhi ban would be a major setback for AB InBev, which is also battling a separate Indian antitrust probe concerning alleged beer price fixing by SABMiller and other companies.
""New Delhi remains an extremely critical market for any beer company ... this is the country's social capital, apart from Mumbai. It's a showcase market for the premium beer portfolio,"" said a former senior AB InBev executive, who declined to be identified.
This month, AB InBev canceled the planned listing in Hong Kong of its Asia Pacific unit, citing ""several factors, including the prevailing market conditions"".
PUB CULTURE
A young and affluent population and a growing pub culture, especially in the big cities, have spurred beer consumption in India. That is despite the fact that the industry is tightly regulated, with most states individually regulating pricing and imposing taxes, which form a vital source of their revenues.
Sandeep Chilana, a New Delhi-based lawyer specializing in excise law, said that rules mandate each beer bottle sold in the city has to have a unique barcode for track and trace purposes, and to ensure there is no duty evasion.
The current dispute centers around a random inspection at BarShala, a drinking spot in a posh New Delhi area, on the night of Aug. 16, 2016. City officials said they found 12 beer bottles of SABMiller brands at the bar that barcode records showed should have been in the company warehouse at the time.
A follow-on investigation showed that some beer bottles sent to the bar in November had identical barcodes to those found in the inspection in August, the government order said.
The bar denied any wrongdoing.
The brewer argued the discrepancy could be due to the technical or clerical errors in the barcoding system, but the city government said the company's defense was ""devoid of merit"", according to the order.
The Delhi government said it was ""reasonable to believe"" that the same barcodes were duplicated multiple times and supplied to various retail vendors in Delhi, adding that this amounted to the offence of selling non-duty paid liquor.
""The same barcodes were supplied twice at the same restaurant and hence the discrepancy could be noticed. Had the same been supplied to a different retail outlet the discrepancy could not have been noticed easily,"" the order said."

1238,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 07:44AM ET</span>",Citi to Cut Hundreds of Trading Jobs in Bad Wall Street Omen,"(Bloomberg) --  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). is preparing to cut hundreds of jobs in its trading division -- stark new evidence that an industrywide slump in revenue this year may be more permanent than the tweets and policy moves rattling clients.
The New York-based bank plans to slash jobs across its fixed-income and stock-trading operations over the course of 2019, according to people familiar with the matter. That includes at least 100 jobs in the equities unit, which would amount to almost 10% of the division’s workforce, the people said. About 80 of the cuts will take place at Citigroup’s London operations, one of the people said.
For months, as global banks watched their revenue from trading slump, industry leaders have said clients were temporarily taking to the “sidelines” amid unpredictable twists in President Donald Trump’s trade negotiations and the Federal Reserve’s shifting stance on interest rates. Yet a growing number of banks are now cutting staff, a sign that executives are worried about more permanent challenges.
“This won’t be the last trading-related job cuts story,” Jeff Harte, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said in a telephone interview. “The rest of Wall Street is thinking the same way.”
A constellation of factors have been weighing on trading desks, aside from this year’s market swings. Hedge funds, typically banks’ most active clients, have suffered outflows while struggling to outperform lower-cost funds. New rules are limiting lenders’ ability and willingness to make principal bets with their own money. And technological advancements are narrowing spreads in many corners of the market.
Trading revenue at the five biggest U.S. banks on Wall Street dropped 8% in the second quarter, following a 14% slide in the first three months of the year -- setting up global banks for their worst first half in more than a decade. At Citigroup, combined revenue from equities and fixed-income trading fell 5%, excluding a one-time gain from selling a stake in a trading venture.
 Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), already struggling to overhaul its Wall Street operations, made the biggest move earlier this month, announcing plans to exit equities trading. The Frankfurt-based firm is cutting a total of 18,000 jobs as part of its broad restructuring. Other major banks in Europe, including  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, are also eliminating hundreds of workers.
“It’s a tough cyclical outlook after broad revenue declines in the first half, and structural client challenges remain,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Alison Williams (NYSE:WMB). “So we could see more staff reductions across banks.”
Under Pressure
At Citigroup, Paco Ybarra has been shaking up the firm’s institutional-clients division since he took the group’s helm this year. That’s included some hiring.
But the bank is under particular pressure to trim costs after promising to improve its efficiency ratio, a gauge of profitability measuring how much is spent to produce a dollar of revenue. Some analysts have expressed disappointment in Citigroup’s progress so far, as well as doubts about its separate goal to boost return on tangible common equity to 12% this year.
The company whittled its efficiency ratio to 56.5% in the first half, a 90 basis-point improvement from last year. The firm is aiming to cut it by a total of 175 basis points this year, though progress can be harder to come by in later months, when banks typically generate less revenue. Citigroup executives vowed this month to continue cutting costs.
“We’re going to do everything within our power to get to those numbers,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat said as the bank posted earnings July 15. The firm won’t end planned investments in technology or risk its efforts to improve safety and soundness, he said. “But everything else is on the table.”
A Citigroup representative declined to comment for this story. The firm’s shares dropped 0.6% to $71.76 in New York on Monday, paring the stock’s advance for the year to 38%.
Equities Battle
The cuts to the equities division are something of an about-face after Citigroup spent years trying to make the unit more formidable.
“We’ve been investing in talent, we’ve been investing in technology, we’ve been allocating balance sheet for our clients -- and we’ve seen the benefit of that,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said of the business at a conference last month. “There’s more to be done there, obviously, but we’re pleased with the progress we’re making.”
Still, the unit has struggled to vault up the league tables. Revenue from trading equities at Citigroup tumbled 17% to $1.6 billion for the first half of 2019. That’s the lowest total among major U.S. firms and would place it sixth among global banks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. And in March, the firm ousted eight equities traders in Hong Kong and suspended three others after a sweeping internal investigation into its dealings with some clients.
In the latest changes under Ybarra, the institutional clients division announced on Monday it would combine its equities business with its prime, futures and securities-services unit, according to an internal memo that cited industry consolidation and intensifying margin pressures.
“Those are similar enough businesses they should be run together,” said Harte, the analyst. “They’ve taken a fresh look or a new set of eyes to a lot of the businesses within the bank, and you’re seeing the changes flow through.”

Although sales remain strong, the rate of like-for-like growth will start to normalize in the second half, the company said Tuesday, causing the shares to lose a little of their recent strong momentum.
“Right now we are experiencing ‘peak Greggs’,” Peel Hunt analysts Jonathan Pritchard and John Stevenson wrote in a note. “Greggs’ growth this year will be stellar, but the market knows that, and with no change to forecasts today given the concerns on the outlook, it will be hard yards for the shares.”
Greggs shares fell as much as 6.7% on Tuesday, before paring declines to trade 4.7% lower as of 11:47 a.m. in London. The stock has been unstoppable this year, gaining 88% through Monday as hype surrounding the introduction of a vegan sausage roll helped its market value surge above 2 billion pounds ($2.4 billion).
“It’s definitely not peak Greggs,” Roger Whiteside, Chief Executive Officer of Greggs, said on a call with journalists. “New customers are being attracted by publicity surrounding the vegan sausage roll and the fact that we’ve been transforming our shops and transforming our offer over the last five years. But we keep adding a hundred new shops, so it can’t be peak Greggs, can it?”
Peel Hunt is the lone bear on the shares, downgrading its rating to reduce earlier this month and recommending that investors take profit. Its price target of 2,000 pence suggests about 12% downside from the last price of 2,272 pence.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 07:22AM ET</span>",Huawei Technologies posts 23% first half revenue growth amid U.S. sanctions,"By Sijia Jiang and Brenda Goh
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies warned on Tuesday a U.S. trade blacklisting will impact short-term revenue growth, even as its half-year revenue surged 23% thanks to soaring smartphone sales at home. 
In its first results since Washington placed it on a so-called entity list in May that effectively banned U.S. firms from supplying to it, Huawei also said it remained focused on improving the global smartphone business which bore the brunt of supply chain disruptions caused by the U.S. action. 
""Revenue grew fast up through May,"" Huawei Chairman Liang Hua told reporters at an earnings briefing.
""Given the foundation we laid in the first half of the year, we continue to see growth even after we were added to the entity list. That's not to say we don't have difficulties ahead. We do, and they may affect the pace of our growth in the short term,"" he said. 
The U.S. government alleges the Chinese firm is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy, which Huawei has repeatedly denied.
It has since been given a three-month reprieve till August 19, and U.S. President Trump signaled Washington would be relaxing the sanctions on Huawei, though details are unknown.
Huawei's founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei told reporters last month that the impact of the blacklisting was worse than expected. It could cost the company $30 billion in revenue, and that Huawei's revenue this year and in 2020 could stay roughly the same as 2018 at around $100 billion, he said. 
Liang said on Tuesday Huawei remained confident in its ability to cope with the blacklisting and its 5G product roll-out had not been affected. The company has won 11 5G contracts since the blacklist was put in place out of a total of 50 bagged so far, he said. 
Analysts said strong domestic smartphone sales and new 5G carrier contracts were helping to offset the impact from the export ban that threatens to cut Huawei's access to advanced U.S. components and software such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android apps. 
Unlisted Huawei, which only started disclosing quarterly results this year, said revenue in the first half rose to 401.3 billion yuan ($58.28 billion), faster than the 15% growth of a year earlier. 
Shipments of its smartphones jumped 24% to 118 million units, as robust sales in China more than offset a global sales drop.
According to data from Canalys, Huawei expanded its lead in China's smartphone market in the second quarter by more than 10 percentage points to nearly 40 percent of the market, while overseas smartphones sales had a slight drop year-on-year.
Liang said that the company's proprietary Hongmeng mobile operating system was still under development for connected devices, and that its preference was to continue to use Google's Android operating system for mobile.
Huawei has given little information about Hongmeng, its own back-up operating system under development in case it was cut off from U.S.-made software. 

""Hongmeng is part of our long-term strategy...we are definitely not bluffing,"" Liang said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A strong rise in oil and gas production helped  BP  (L:BP) offset weaker crude prices and refining profit to again beat profit expectations on Tuesday, boosting its shares.
BP's second quarter contrasts with  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Norway's Equinor (OL:EQNR), which posted sharp earnings drops, and builds on a steady recovery after deep cost cuts since the 2014 downturn, project start-ups and last year's $10.5 billion purchase of BHP's U.S. shale assets.
""At the midpoint of our five-year plan, BP is right on target,"" Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement.
By 0953 GMT, BP shares were up 3.1% to 543.5 pence, the top gainers in the FTSE 100 (FTSE) index.
(GRAPHIC - BP profits: https://tmsnrt.rs/2MqbBbG)
Although BP's dividend remained unchanged at 10.25 cents per share, its Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said the company would consider raising it towards the end of the year as proceeds from asset sales come through and debt is reduced.
BP's results beat expectations for 10 quarters in a row, analysts at Bernstein said.
""Strong volume growth from accretive barrels and seamless execution remains underappreciated,"" said Bernstein, which has an ""outperform"" recommendation on the stock. 
Underlying replacement cost profit, the company's definition of net income, reached $2.8 billion in the second quarter, exceeding a company-provided forecast of $2.46 billion.
The second-quarter profit was up from $2.4 billion in the previous quarter, while BP's operating cash flow recovered to $6.8 billion in the quarter from $5.3 billion in the previous quarter as a result of a one-off working capital release.
HIGHER PRODUCTION
Second-quarter production rose to 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, 4% higher than a year earlier.
BP said it expects third-quarter 2019 reported production to be lower than second-quarter, reflecting maintenance activities as well as the impact of Hurricane Barry on operations in the Gulf of Mexico.
Benchmark Brent crude oil prices in the second quarter averaged around $69 a barrel, up from $63 the previous quarter but down from $74 a barrel a year earlier, BP said.
In the refining and marketing segment, known as downstream, profits dropped due to lower sales and refinery throughput as plants underwent maintenance ahead of a major change in marine fuel standards in 2020.
Global growth in oil demand slowed in the first half of the year to around 1 million barrels per day but has slightly recovered in the second half, CFO Gilvary told Reuters.
(GRAPHIC - BP Q2 cashflow: https://tmsnrt.rs/2yp7B2U)
Despite the higher profit, BP's debts rose in the first half of the year to $46.5 billion from $38.7 billion the previous year, mostly as a result of the BHP acquisition. 
Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP's market value, rose to 31% compared with 27.5%.
Shell (L:RDSa) reports results on Thursday, while  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and  Chevron  (N:CVX) are scheduled for Friday.
STRAIT OF HORMUZ
BP has not taken any of its oil tankers through the Strait of Hormuz since a July 10 attempt by Iran to seize one of its vessels, Gilvary said.
Gilvary added that the company had no plans to take any of its tankers through the world's most important waterway for oil shipments, but was moving oil out of the region using chartered tankers.

Tensions spiked between Iran and Britain this month when Iranian commandos seized a British-flagged tanker.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 06:09AM ET</span>","'We may lose Christmas': escalating Hong Kong protests taking bigger toll on shops, economy","By Kevin Liu and Vimvam Tong
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Months of increasingly violent protests in Hong Kong are taking a growing toll on the city's economy, weighing on confidence and scaring away tourists from one of the world's most vibrant shopping destinations.
Economists say the impact of anti-government protests over the past eight weeks is already worse than in 2014, when a so-called ""Umbrella revolution"" paralyzed the city's financial district for 79 days.
Demonstrations are more spread out across the city this time and violence has been more intense, prompting local and foreign shoppers to avoid certain areas. Stores and even bank branches have been forced to close for prolonged periods.
Many businesses in the port city on the southern Chinese coast are already facing strains from China's economic slowdown and fallout from the year-long Sino-U.S. trade war.
Various strikes are planned in coming weeks, while disruptive civil disobedience actions are taking place almost daily and look set to continue for months. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters blocked train services, causing commuter chaos. 
The main retail association has warned members expect a double-digit drop in sales in July and August. The government will release June sales data on Thursday.
""Hong Kong's retail industry will be affected both internally and externally,"" said Angela Cheng, economist at CMB International Capital Corporation Limited, adding she had revised her 2019 retail sales forecast to as much as a 10% drop, twice as deep as her previous estimate.
Brokerage CLSA downgraded local jeweler Chow Tai Fook, one of the city's most popular brands with mainland tourists, to 'sell' from 'outperform' on July 23, saying the protests could cause permanent long-term damage.
Luxury group Richemont warned in July that protests hurt its sales, while Swiss watchmaker Swatch said political turbulence contributed to a double-digit decline in sales in Hong Kong, one of its most important markets globally.
Around the Admiralty district, where much of the protests have centered, staff at several restaurants and shops told Reuters on Monday that patrons have dropped by a third from a month earlier. 
BUSINESS AND MORALS
Bobby Tang, a 21-year-old sales representative at a Gucci store in the Causeway Bay shopping district, where protest barricades were raised for the first time on Sunday, supports the civil movement. 
He says the government has failed to respond to any of its demands, which at first were focused on withdrawing a controversial China extradition bill, but have morphed into a much wider pro-democracy struggle.
But he also worries about his job at the French luxury group. Prior to the protests, the store had one client per minute, he said, but now it was 3-4 per hour and daily sales have fallen to HK$20,000 ($2,560) from HK$100,000. 
""If the protests last until October, I worry if I can earn enough salary,"" Tang said. 
Shopping malls are often being used for rest breaks by protesters wearing helmets and goggles and sometimes carrying makeshift weapons.
The protesters have been largely respectful of the premises, but on one occasion one mall turned into a battle ground. As police tried to disperse crowds in the Sha Tin working class district on July 14, it ended up chasing them into a shopping center managed by Sun Hung Kai Properties. 
Fighting erupted and scenes of regular shoppers with bulky bags running away while trying to maintain balance on bloody, slippery floors were broadcast worldwide. 
Tourism, especially from mainland China, has dropped markedly. Britain, Japan, Singapore and others have issued travel alerts.
Hong Kong's Federation of Trade Unions said hotel occupancy rates fell 20% in June year-on-year, and probably 40% in July.
A local tour manager who gave only his surname Yu said around two-thirds of his mainland clients have canceled bookings.
LONG-TERM RISKS 
Fitch Ratings said in a note on Tuesday the unrest could damage business confidence and the quality of governance. It also raised longer-term concerns about policy paralysis and erosion of the rule of law.
A 1992 U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act allowing Washington to have a different customs regime with Hong Kong than with mainland China was also crucial for the stability of the Chinese-ruled city.
For it to stand, U.S. authorities need to see Hong Kong as sufficiently independent from Beijing, therefore they will scrutinize the latter's every step during the protests.
Fitch affirmed Hong Kong's AA+ rating on June 11. 
""Evidence of a permanent loss of confidence in public institutions or tangible reduction of the territory's semi-autonomy as granted under the Basic Law, would ... be grounds to review the ratings,"" Fitch said.
The American Chamber of Commerce warned that international businesses were feeling pessimistic on short-term prospects and that the government should take immediate actions to address the root causes of the demonstrations. 
""The protests have a chance to last until the end of the year. We may even lose on Christmas, which should be the best sales season,"" said Fung, a sales assistant for a skin care company who only gave her last name.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 06:01AM ET</span>","Swiss group GAM declares truce with Haywood, appoints new CEO","By Michael Shields and Simon Jessop
ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Embattled Swiss asset manager GAM Holding (S:GAMH) called a truce with former star manager Tim Haywood after months of wrangling over his sacking, saying it was drawing a line under a saga that hammered its share price last year.
The group also on Tuesday named BlackRock (N:BLK) executive Peter Sanderson as its chief executive after an eight-month search. Its shares bounced more than 7 percent from a near two-month low seen the previous session.
GAM's stock lost three quarters of its value in 2018 after the dismissal of Haywood for alleged breaches of the company's rules prompted the closure of his funds and spurred clients to pull billions of Swiss francs from the company.
Heading off concerns of a protracted legal tussle that could hamper attempts to restore investor confidence, GAM said both parties had agreed a ceasefire, without giving details.
""GAM is focused on the future of the business, and while it stands by its finding of gross misconduct, it has agreed with Tim Haywood that neither party will pursue the other based on current facts,"" it said on Tuesday.
A spokesman for Haywood said he had declined to proceed with a case before an employment tribunal because the expected legal costs far exceeded the possible financial award.
""Mr Haywood still believes in the merit of his case for unfair dismissal,"" the spokesman said, adding Haywood was pleased clients of his absolute return bond fund range would get their money back, in some cases more than 100%.
""I am extremely grateful to all parties, inside and outside GAM, who worked so assiduously to create such a positive outcome for clients,"" the spokesman quoted Haywood as saying.
After completing the planned return of capital to investors in Haywood's funds, Interim Chief Executive David Jacob said the company could now ""close the most difficult chapter in our history"".
Jacob told an analyst call that the company had seen net inflows of client cash to its funds during June and July and continued to look at options to maximize shareholder value, amid talk a rival could bid for the firm as part of an industry consolidation trend.
COMPETITIVE EDGE
GAM announced the appointment of Sanderson as chief executive as of Sept. 1, replacing Jacob, who will become chairman. Sanderson's predecessor Alexander Friedman had left last November after agreeing with the board the company would be best served by new leadership.
Sanderson, a Briton born in 1978, served at BlackRock as head of financial services consulting, EMEA; co-head of multi-asset investment solutions in EMEA; and chief operating officer for BlackRock Solutions in EMEA.
""At GAM, he will be focused on further simplifying the business and concentrating on areas of recognized expertise where GAM has competitive edge in order to put the business back on a growth trajectory,"" it said in a statement.
Shares in GAM were up 7.5% by 0928 GMT.
As already flagged this month, GAM posted a net loss of 13.6 million Swiss francs ($13.7 million) in the first half on an IFRS basis. Net fee and commission income fell to 171.1 million from 287.7 million a year earlier as a result of substantially lower levels of assets under management.
Net outflows in investment management amounted to 7.6 billion in the first half, partly offset by positive net market and foreign exchange movements of 3.6 billion.
Separately, Zuercher Kantonalbank [ZKB.UL] said it was buying four Swiss precious metals funds from GAM with assets under management of 1.8 billion francs, and GAM's money market funds domiciled in Luxembourg with assets under management of approximately 400 million francs.
The purchase price of 14 million francs corresponds to around 0.6% of the acquired assets."
1257,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 05:53AM ET</span>",Beyond Meat Plummets on Plan to Offer More Shares to Fund Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- Beyond Meat Inc. plummeted 11% on a plan by inside shareholders and the faux-meat company to sell more than 3 million shares, just three months after it went public.
The transaction will let early investors such as Kleiner Perkins and Obvious Ventures and executives including Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown take profits on a small portion of their stakes after an almost 800% gain in the stock since the IPO. The offering will help Beyond fund increased production and marketing as the company battles it out in an increasingly crowded vegan marketplace.
The news caused the stock to slide in trading before U.S. exchanges opened and put a damper on what had been another upbeat earnings report from Beyond Meat, with sales surpassing analysts’ estimates. By dumping about 5% of the company’s outstanding shares on the market at once, the sale will hurt the value of other investors’ holdings. The transaction includes 3 million shares held by Beyond Meat stockholders and 250,000 held by the company itself.
Lock-Up Change
The optics of insiders selling shares weren’t great -- especially because board members, executives and investors had originally agreed not to dispose of any stock until Oct. 28, six months after the IPO. But underwriters Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) waived that restriction for this share sale, the company said.
Brown, who is personally offering 39,121 shares in the base offering, said on the earnings call that Beyond Meat wouldn’t answer analyst questions about the offering on Monday “due to regulatory requirements.”
News of the secondary offering came just minutes after the company released earnings for the second time since going public. Revenue in the second quarter almost quadrupled to $67.3 million from a year earlier and grew 67% quarter on quarter, while the gross profit margin widened. Still, the alternative-meat company reported another loss per share in the quarter as it struggles to turn a profit.
Raised Forecast
Despite the stock slide, investors have reasons to be bullish. Beyond Meat raised its revenue guidance for 2019 to $240 million on Monday, up from more than $210 million previously. It also now sees positive Ebitda -- a measure of profit that excludes taxes, interest expenses and other expenses.
Beyond Meat has been racking up big restaurant companies as clients in recent months, and the company said it will continue to expand its distribution channels and launch new products without elaborating.
Short sellers have argued the stock’s value is too high. Part of that concern comes from rising competition. As growing numbers of consumers say they want to eat less meat, food companies and traditional meat sellers are scrambling to jump onto the trend.
Beyond Meat already has deals in place with Dunkin’, Tim Hortons and TGI Fridays, but investors want to see if Beyond Meat can score an even bigger partner. Competitor Impossible Foods has set the bar high with its Impossible Whopper that’s going nationwide with Burger King.
‘Tremendous Lead’
Asked about the company’s strategy amid rising competition, Brown said Beyond has “a tremendous lead in terms of distribution and in terms of brand awareness.”
The company plans to boost its capital expenditures to a range of $35 million to $40 million next year to expand its production facilities in Missouri and boost capacity. That’s well above the $17 million investment forecast the company gave for 2019 in its IPO prospectus.
The surprise share sale, and Beyond’s plans to increase capital spending next year, were reminders that the company is still in its early stages and feels pressure to spend big to establish territory in a burgeoning industry. That means investors who have poured into the stock in the past few months will need to reflect on their appetite for risk."
1258,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 05:53AM ET</span>",Centrica CEO to Step Down After First Dividend Cut in Years,"(Bloomberg) --  Centrica  Plc (LON:CNA) said its chief executive officer will step down after a tumultuous five-year run at Britain’s largest energy supplier, which has lost two-thirds of its value and millions of customers during his term.
Iain Conn, 56, announced his departure along with Centrica’s first dividend cut since 2015. He will leave the board in 2020 after he finishes an effort to fortify the utility against increasing competition and a government cap on what it can charge for its electricity and natural gas.
Centrica shares fell as much as 13% in London to the lowest since 1997, the year the utility was spun out of the state-owned British Gas. Conn inherited a company that had under his predecessors diversified into oil and gas production and nuclear energy, businesses that Centrica now intends to sell.
In more recent years, smaller rivals have lured away tens of thousands of customers from Britain’s Big Six utilities. Centrica earnings were also hit in the first half as warm weather and operational issues cut its electricity supply by 4%.
Conn said his departure was a mutual decision with the board and the result of months of discussions. Conn is seeking to hand over a smaller entity focused on customer-facing businesses supplying power and energy services. The board will name a successor later.
While the company’s share price plunged to new lows, Conn said the company was on the right track and seeing the beginning of stabilization. He said the earnings outlook is brighter for the rest of the year.
“This set of steps is a fundamental re-positioning of the company and is the end of a journey we began in 2015,” Conn said on a call with reporters Tuesday. “We haven’t changed our strategy. We’ve made some adjustments, but the board has confirmed we need to keep going toward the customer.”
Unions were quick to criticize Conn’s plan to maintain the pace of job cuts he announced in February and step up a cost savings target.
Centrica is targeting 1 billion pounds ($1.2 billion) of annual cost savings from this year through 2022, up by 250 million pounds since February. The company maintained its estimate that it will shed 1,500 to 2,000 jobs this year from the some 30,520 it had at the end of 2018.
“More of the same, more job cuts on top of the thousands already gone and going, are panic measures, not a credible plan for recovery,” said Justin Bowden, national secretary of the GMB union. “There must be a pause under a new CEO, investment and a new plan for growth.”
Dividend Cut
The board proposed an interim dividend of 1.5 pence a share, down from 3.6 pence for the same period a year ago. For the full year, the dividend will be cut to 5 pence a share, down from 12 pence in the last four years.
“The departure of Centrica’s CEO won’t resolve all of its problems, in our view, as many are outside management’s control,” Elchin Mammadov, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note. “The new team at the helm will need to focus on delivering further cost cuts and growth in energy supply and services.”
Customer numbers in Centrica’s main energy supply and services business fell 2% to 23.6 million in the first half of the year. Output from its 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear plants fell 19% in the first half to 4.9 terawatt-hours, reflecting outages at the Dungeness B and Hunterston B power stations.
“Centrica faced an exceptionally challenging environment in the first half of 2019, which impacted earnings and cash flows,” Conn said in a statement on Tuesday. “This major refocusing of our portfolio will unlock further efficiencies enabling us to be even more cost-competitive, as we focus on being a leading energy services and solutions provider.”
Looking Ahead
Conn maintained guidance for full year earnings. Nuclear plant outages that hit earnings in the first half are likely to pass, and cost savings set to kick in.
Centrica expects growth in its consumer businesses. In its connected homes business, growth accelerated 49% to 1.5 million.
In the months ahead, Centrica will work on selling its Spirit Energy unit, which produces oil and natural gas. It’s already divesting its stake in nuclear power plants, although the statement on Tuesday said nothing new about that process. Conn said Centrica will exit Spirit via a trade sale and use proceeds to restructure the company.
“We are completing the shift we began in 2015 from a company ill-equipped to deal with changes in the energy systems to one in tune with moving toward a lower-carbon economy,” Conn said. “Once we’ve made them, it is now time for me to hand over to a successor.”
Along with its shift toward a more customer-facing business, the company also wants to make money off the expansion of electric vehicles. It announced a new partnership with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. on Tuesday to develop charging stations at hundreds of dealerships across the U.K. and Ireland as well as sell home charging equipment and electric vehicle tariffs.
The company is in talks with other car companies to expand further into this area, Sarwjit Sambhi, head of Centrica’s consumer business, said on a call with reporters.

Lufthansa warned Tuesday that the fight for market share means business trends could deteriorate further in the second half, sending the stock down 7.4% even as the group stood by reduced full-year profit guidance issued last month.
Europe’s biggest airline joins discount rival Ryanair Holdings Plc in clinging to its earnings goals in the face of falling fares, slowing GDP growth, rising fuel costs and disruption from congested airspace and extreme weather. Lufthansa’s home German market has become a key battleground, with the collapse of smaller carriers unleashing a bruising fight for market share.
“Europe is the problem,” Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said, adding that quarterly figures in line with expectations don’t allay more deep-seated concerns. “As we move into peak summer, messages of a tough environment continuing should leave investors cautious on demand for the rest of 2019.”
Shares of Lufthansa traded 5.2% lower at 14.34 euros as of 10:13 a.m. in Frankfurt, taking the decline this year to 27% and reducing the company’s market value to 6.83 billion euros ($7.6 billion). The stock fell 12% after the June 17 profit warning.
Adjusted earnings before interest and tax dropped by one-quarter to 754 million euros in the three months through June, Lufthansa reported, in line with an average analyst estimate of 757 million euros.
Short-haul routes are most under pressure, with yields, a measure of fares, tumbling at the Eurowings discount arm that the group had expanded to combat Ryanair, but which it now plans to rein in after mounting losses.
Lufthansa said it doesn’t see things improving this year, with discounts continuing to weigh on ticket prices. Budget carriers operating in Germany cut fares as much as 10% in recent months, according to a government report, indicating that the market still has excess seats despite the demise of Air Berlin, Britain’s Monarch, Iceland-based Wow and a host of smaller operators.
Headwinds from a German economic slowdown are also building amid simmering trade tensions, with business confidence at its lowest in a decade.
As well as hitting corporate demand for flights, the conflict is crimping earnings at Lufthansa’s cargo arm, which were 88% lower than a year ago. Routes between Asia and Europe are particularly weak, and the airline said margin targets at the unit are at risk.
Chief Financial Officer Ulrik Svensson blamed oversupply and “tough competition” for the pressure on earnings and said Lufthansa will respond “by further reducing our costs and increasing our flexibility.” Ryanair said Monday that it’s not about to ease up on capacity despite a 21% drop in quarterly profit, arguing that its cost base gives it an edge over European rivals.
Lufthansa’s full-service rivals Air France-KLM and IAG (LON:ICAG) SA, which owns British Airways and Spain’s Iberia, are due to report earnings on Wednesday and Friday respectively.

1260,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 05:22AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Dire Results and Forecasts Send Markets Tumbling,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were broadly lower again Tuesday, thanks to some grim trading updates from across the region that cut across numerous sectors, illustrating the breadth of the problems at Europe Inc.
German airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) said its preferred measure of operating profit fell 25% in the second quarter, thanks to overcapacity and cooling demand, problems that rival Ryanair had flagged on Monday.
Lufthansa said it expects its low-cost Eurowings subsidiary, which was supposed to immunize it against the threat from discounters such as Ryanair (LON:RYA) and EasyJet (LON:EZJ), to lose money this year, with an adjusted profit margin as low as -6%.
Another German company to disappoint was Bayer (DE:BAYGN), whose shares fell 3.9% after the company said organic sales growth rose only 1% on the year in the second quarter. It also said that its profit targets looked “increasingly ambitious”, given the mounting liabilities from its Roundup weedkiller and given the weakness of demand from U.S. farmers for its crop sciences products. Extreme weather and the U.S. trade conflict with China have both taken their toll
But the falls in Lufthansa and Bayer (DE:BAYGN) are just sideshows compared to the carnage at two of Europe’s biggest energy-related companies.   Centrica   (LON:CNA), the U.K.’s biggest utility, fell nearly 12% to its lowest in over 20 years, after outgoing chief executive Ian Conn slashed the company’s dividend by over half in response to price pressures and pension deficits. Conn, who had been expected to stand down, also announced the sale of the company’s oil and gas production arm, Spirit Energy.
And elsewhere, the world’s biggest producer of offshore wind turbines, Siemens   Gamesa   (MC:SGREN), fell over 15% after revising down its profit margin forecasts for the year in response to sustained lower prices – a reflection of the growing maturity of the wind energy market in Europe, where governments are rapidly phasing out subsidies. In contrast to  Centrica  (LON:CNA), some shareholders in Gamesa can still hope to realize some profits, having seen the shares rise some 60% since October.
  Vestas Wind   Systems (CSE:VWS) and   Nordex   (DE:NDXG), two other large turbine makers, were each down around 5% in sympathy.
It’s not all doom and gloom, however: oil and gas giant  BP  (LON:BP) rose 2.9% after higher production offset lower prices, allowing it to post underlying profit ahead of analyst expectations and unchanged from a year ago. 
Like many other commodity-oriented U.K. stocks, BP’s share price is getting a bump from the sharp drop in sterling over the last week, which makes their dollar-denominated income streams automatically more valuable in the companies’ reporting currency.
The FTSE 100 was again the best performing of the major European indexes, falling less than 0.1%, while Germany’s Dax fell 1.2% and the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 fell 0.8% to its lowest in a week. "

The forecast would see Wall Street extend its decade-long bull run into another year and easily breach its intraday record of 3,027.98 set on Friday as investors bet on a boost from an expected rate cut from the Federal Reserve this week.
""The dovish Fed pivot has driven the equity market rally in 2019, and we expect low interest rates will continue to support above-average valuations going forward,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note.
Though Goldman expects markets to finish 2019 with the best annual performance since 2013, it sees a slowdown in 2019 earnings per share growth for S&P 500 companies at just 3%, a far cry from the 23% it recorded last year, when U.S. President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts fueled gains.
The bank also expects corporate margins to contract by 39 basis points in 2019 due to rising input and labor costs and as companies face the effect of tit-for-tat tariffs by the United States and China in a protracted trade war, which increase costs.
""Most of the change in our earnings estimate is driven by weaker-than-expected economic activity, oil prices, and margins, particularly within semiconductors,"" Goldman Sachs added.
Their economists however expect a modest rebound in U.S. and global economic growth and ""idiosyncratic headwinds"" within semiconductors to abate next year.
For 2020, the bank set a 3,400 point price target for the S&P 500, a 10% rise from its 2019 price target. It expects 2020 earnings growth of 6%, well below consensus of 11%.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Shares in India's biggest coffee-chain owner Coffee Day Enterprises (NS:CODE) slumped 20% on Tuesday after its founder and largest shareholder was reported missing, with local media citing a letter allegedly written by him that shows he was under pressure from lenders.
V.G. Siddhartha, the founder of the Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) chain, was not reachable since late Monday, Coffee Day Enterprises said in a regulatory filing, adding it was seeking help of local authorities.
The entrepreneur may have taken his life as he faced pressure over outstanding debt and unpaid dues, domestic media reported, citing the letter that was purportedly written by Siddhartha and addressed to the board of the company on July 27.
""I would like to say I gave it my all. I am very sorry to let down all of the people that put their trust in me. I fought for a long time, but today I gave up,"" Siddhartha allegedly wrote in the letter, which was available on social media and published by media.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the letter and its contents. One board member that Reuters spoke with said they had not personally received the letter and could not comment on its authenticity.
Coffee Day declined to comment on the letter.
Siddhartha was on his way to Mangaluru, a port city about 350 km from India's tech hub of Bengaluru, local (Mangaluru) police said.
""Siddhartha went missing last night near the Nethravathi river. A missing person case has been registered and a search is underway,"" police officer Hanumantharaya told Reuters.
Local television channels showed rescue workers in rubber boats scouring the waters beneath a bridge where Siddhartha was reportedly last seen.
INVESTOR PANIC
The company's stock hit an all-time low on Tuesday. Shares were trading at 153.4 rupees, as of 0625 GMT, after hitting their lower circuit for the trading day.
Coffee Day sought to allay investor concerns, saying in its filing that the ""company is professionally managed and led by competent leadership team, which will ensure continuity of business.""
A source aware of the developments said the company's board had convened an emergency meeting at 0930 GMT (3 p.m. local time) to discuss further steps.
Siddhartha is a well-known Indian entrepreneur and started CCD over two decades ago. He owns a direct stake of 32.75% in the company, and together with his family controls 53.93% of the firm.
He was in talks with  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) to sell CCD for as much as $1.45 billion, The Economic Times reported last month. He recently sold about 20% of his stake in tech firm Mindtree (NS:MINT) to engineering and construction company Larsen & Toubro Ltd (NS:LART).

1263,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 04:47AM ET</span>",U.S. firms see little clarity on Huawei as U.S.-China talks resume,"By Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A month after President Donald Trump said he would allow U.S. companies to resume selling to blacklisted Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, his administration has done little to clarify what sales will be permitted.
The lack of clarity on what U.S. firms can supply to the world's top producer of telecommunications equipment as long as it's on a so-called ""entity list"" is likely to cast a shadow over this week's U.S.-China trade negotiations in Shanghai.
Trump had pledged to allow the sales as a goodwill gesture to President Xi Jinping when the two met last month and agreed to restart talks to try to resolve their year-long trade war. China, for its part, agreed to restart large-scale agricultural purchases.
U.S. chipmakers cheered Trump's announcement, which administration officials clarified afterwards meant the government would issue export licenses in cases where there is no national security risk and where the items are ""non-sensitive"" and readily replaced by rivals.
But the department has yet to respond to any of a total of around 50 license requests from about 35 companies, sowing uncertainty in the industry and in Beijing.
""At this stage, there is mass confusion,"" said William Reinsch, a former Commerce official, adding that the plan for case-by-case decisions ""maximizes the uncertainty."" 
The governments of the world's two largest economies have imposed billions of dollars of tariffs on each other's goods, slowing global growth and roiling markets.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He starting on Tuesday, the first face-to-face meeting since the two leaders met. 
Many people close to the talks expect the topic of Huawei to dominate, along with the failure of Chinese agricultural purchases to meet expectations, taking time and attention away from the many deeper, longer term issues. 
Trump hosted a meeting of seven technology CEOs last week to discuss Huawei and other topics, at which the executives expressed frustration at Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for not providing clear guidelines, Reuters reported.
""By making the meeting public, the U.S. was trying to send a signal, 'we’re moving on Huawei, we need you to move on agriculture',"" said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator and Vice President of the Asia Society Policy Institute. 
PAR FOR THE COURSE
Many companies have halted sales to Huawei since the company was put on the entity list on May 16, while some have chosen to resume selling items made abroad. Some, including  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Qualcomm (O:QCOM), began pressing Commerce for carve-outs soon after. Some companies have taken advantage of a narrow ""temporary general license"" provided by the Commerce Department which allows for transactions such as software updates for Huawei.
Last week, Intel and  Xilinx Inc  (O:XLNX) said they had applied for licenses to resume sales of some products to Huawei. The companies also said they had resumed sales of some products they had independently determined were not subject to the ban.
Secretary Ross has said responses to requests for licenses are coming in a matter of weeks. 
""It's par for the course for this administration,"" said trade lawyer Doug Jacobson. ""They are making up policy as they go along based on the president's direction."" 
The uncertainty continues to roil global industry.
Last month San Jose, California-based Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) forecast that the U.S.-China trade tensions and the Huawei ban would knock $2 billion off its sales this year. CEO Hock Tan said there was no obvious substitution for Huawei, which accounted for about $900 million or 4 percent of its sales last year.
 Fedex Corp  (N:FDX) last week said ""unclear"" Commerce department policy on Huawei ""resulted in considerable complexity for our operations,"" to explain why it held back more than 100 Huawei packages, which is now under investigation by Chinese authorities.
The May blacklisting represented a significant escalation in Washington's campaign against Huawei, which it says steals U.S. intellectual property and violates Iran sanctions.
CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on a U.S. warrant on charges she misled global banks about Huawei's relationship with a company in Iran. Meng, who is also the Huawei CEO's daughter, maintains her innocence and is fighting extradition. 
Washington has also launched a lobbying effort to convince U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations.
Judith Alison Lee, a trade attorney at Gibson Dunn, said her clients have received requests from Commerce for more information related to their license applications but no approvals so far. 
""There is a real sense of uncertainty at the department about where the administration is going on Huawei,"" she said.

""Every day that goes by it creates more damage to Huawei and the Chinese, and that makes the trade talks that much more difficult.""

(Reuters) - European shares slipped on Tuesday as grim forecasts from German giants Bayer and Lufthansa soured sentiment, while a battered pound helped London's blue-chip index outperform for a second day.
Bayer (DE:BAYGn) slipped 3% as it became the latest agricultural supplies company to be affected by flooded farms in the United States and by trade disputes, saying its full-year earnings target has become harder to reach.
Airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) dropped 5.6% after posting a decline in second-quarter earnings and saying that the European market was likely to remain challenging this year.
That helped make Europe's travel and leisure index (SXTP) the biggest faller among major sectors, with a 1.1% drop that would be its worst in more than a month.
With concerns about global growth still bubbling among investors, a GfK survey showed German consumer morale worsening for the third month in a row heading into August as trade disputes bit in Europe's biggest exporter.
Germany's main stocks index (GDAXI) fell 0.5% by 0758 GMT, while the broader pan-European stocks STOXX 600 (STOXX) lost 0.4%.
""Most markets are down this morning,"" said Simona Gambarini, a markets economist at Capital Economics. ""The S&P closed lower yesterday. We have a few data releases regarding the eurozone that could push equity prices down but I think everyone is waiting for the Fed meeting.""
As evidence continues to build of the impact of a bruising trade war on global growth, expectations that major central banks will adopt accommodative policies have buoyed global markets since a sharp fall in May.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver a quarter-point cut in rates on Wednesday, although there is some lingering hope it could respond to President Donald Trump's call for a bigger move - or at least point the way to more easing in the near future.
London's blue chip FTSE 100 (FTSE) index was the big outperformer of the main indexes, touching fresh 11 month highs on the back of a 3% jump in shares for energy giant  BP  (L:BP).

The firm is Ruihua Certified Public Accounts, which the Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accounts said was the second largest domestic auditor by revenue in 2018.
Regulators have suspended the approvals for initial public offerings (IPOs) by 28 companies that have Ruihua as their accountant.
Also, officials have halted the process of giving permission to 21 other companies who planned refinancing in the market.
In the past month, at least four other companies have said they were dropping Ruihua as their auditor. The most recent, in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange late Monday, is solar panel producer Longi Green Energy Technology (SS:601012).
Ruihua, which says on its website that it has more than 300 listed companies as clients, did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
On July 8, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said it had launched a probe into Ruihua. In May, the firm's audit client Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co. (SZ:002450) stunned investors by reporting missing bank deposits worth 12.21 billion yuan ($1.77 billion).
Earlier this month, the CSRC said it found Kangde Xin executives had inflated profits by 11.9 billion yuan between 2015 and 2018 and did not fully disclose dealings by related parties.
Ruihua has audited Kangde Xin since 2013. In a statement on its website on Sunday, Ruihua said it had been diligent in its work for Kangde Xin and had found nothing abnormal at the company.

CSRC's probe comes at a time growing numbers of investors have called for tougher action against corporate malfeasance.
On Friday, the CSRC vowed to boost jail terms and fines for executives, controlling shareholders, auditors and sponsors who break disclosure rules.
Allen Huang, a bond investor, said ""We certainly welcome harsher punishment,"" adding that ""the cost of cheating China is too low.""
The crackdown also comes as Beijing is dealing with a slowing economy and trade conflict with Washington - increasing politicians' focus on boosting domestic performance.
Xin Chen, finance professor at Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, said that restoring investor faith was key to building an efficient capital market that could help fund high-tech companies and aid China in its jockeying with the United States.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The global telecoms industry on Tuesday demanded access to the high-capacity spectrum it says it needs to support data-intensive 5G services, accusing the space lobby of hogging frequencies in a way that could stunt the technology.
The call by the GSMA, which represents 750 operators and another 350 firms in the mobile industry ranging from Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) to China's Huawei, global leader in telecoms networks, comes ahead of a standards-setting conference that will decide who gets to use the so-called millimeter wave frequencies.
Such high-band spectrum, with frequencies of 26 Gigahertz and up, has the greatest capacity to transfer data - faster even than the mid-range spectrum already being used in some countries that can download a Hollywood movie to a smartphone in seconds.
Yet gaining full access to the spectrum could be hampered by satellite operators who want to keep a wide margin of unused bandwidth to ensure that 5G does not interfere with critical services such as weather forecasting.
""We're heading for a confrontation here,"" Brett Tarnutzer, the GSMA's head of spectrum, said in an interview, urging flexibility on the part of the commercial space industry, U.S. space agency NASA and its European counterpart ESA.
The GSMA's call comes ahead of the World Radiocommunications Conference in Egypt, a month-long gathering starting on Oct. 28 where the 190 member nations of a United Nations telecoms forum will thrash out policy on high-band spectrum.
The GSMA is cranking up its lobbying operation early to counter concerns - aired by the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -that 5G services may interfere with sensors used in weather and climate forecasting.
Officials from NASA and NOAA have testified at U.S. congressional hearings that 5G interference could make it harder for weather forecasters to predict the path a hurricane will take, thus putting lives at risk.
Tarnutzer dismissed those arguments as misinformation and said they threaten to delay the benefits of 5G that would also accrue to developing nations by, for example, making it possible to run ports and shipping more efficiently.
In all, the GSMA estimates the economic benefits of 5G for the global economy at $565 billion through 2034, equivalent to 2.9% of estimated growth until then.
The GSMA's appeal to emerging nations seeks to build a coalition to back its cause. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the UN telecoms forum, works on a principle of one country, one vote.

""So often we think about 5G as a very first-world technology, but we have found that it is going to have major potential globally,"" said Tarnutzer.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies cemented its dominance of the domestic smartphone market in the second quarter, with shipments and market share rising, as Chinese customers backed the embattled firm amid its trade fight with the United States.
Huawei, which was put on a trade blacklist by the United States since mid-May and was virtually barred from doing business there even earlier, shipped 37.3 million smartphones in China in the three months ended June, up 31% year-on-year, according to market research firm Canalys.
Its market share rose more than 10 percentage points to 38% in the quarter, even as all other top vendors lost ground in the world's biggest smartphone market, the Canalys data showed.
Huawei was added by Washington to a so-called Entity List in May. The blacklisting has threatened to cut its access to essential U.S. components and software such as the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android apps.
The addition to the list ""caused uncertainty overseas"" but the firm has been shifting its focus towards its home market, where it invested in an aggressive offline expansion to lure consumers with a patriotic sales pitch, said Canalys analyst Mo Jia.
Calls to support Huawei have consistently surfaced on Chinese social media on comment threads trailing news on the company.
Kitty Fok, who tracks China's smartphone sector at research firm IDC, said that consumers responded to the spat over Huawei with pro-China sentiment, which helped boost the brand's already-strong appeal in the country.
""The product itself is already well-recognised, and the trade war helped people feel like they need to support Huawei. The only worry was that they might not get the component supply, but in the end, they did,"" said Fok.
Huawei's second-quarter smartphone shipments surged even as overall Chinese smartphone shipments shrank. Smartphone shipments in China declined by 6% in the quarter to 97.6 million units, the 9th consecutive quarterly fall, according to Canalys. 
Oppo, Vivo,  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL), the top four vendors behind Huawei, saw declines in shipments and market share in the quarter, Canalys said. 
The second-quarter China shipments represented 64% of Huawei's total smartphone shipments in the quarter, it said. 

""Clearly the international market is a risky one now, whereas in China, where the Android ecosystem is most mature, in terms of sales channels and software income, Huawei has clear advantage in price negotiation,"" said Canalys analyst Jia.

The company said it was still aiming for an increase in 2019 adjusted core earnings or EBITDA to about 12.2 billion euros ($13.6 billion), excluding the effect of currency swings and the planned sale of assets such as its animal health unit.
""This outlook is becoming increasingly ambitious in view of the challenging environment for the Crop Science business,"" the company, which last year acquired  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion, added in a statement on Tuesday. 
Sales at the Crop Science unit jumped by almost 60% to 4.8 billion euros in the quarter, thanks to the addition of Monsanto in June 2018, but a like-for-like comparison of the combined agriculture business showed a 9.9% sales decline, also adjusted for currency swings.
""Flooding and heavy rains in the midwestern United States and drought in large parts of Europe and in Canada had a negative effect. Ongoing trade disputes also weighed on business,"" it said.
Adjusted EBITDA rose by about a quarter to 2.9 billion euros, bolstered by new prescriptions of stroke prevention drug Xarelto and eye treatment Eylea, broadly in line with market expectations. 
But the number of lawsuits over Bayer's glyphosate-based weedkillers, which it acquired as part of the Monsanto takeover, continued to swell. 
It said 18,400 plaintiffs were seeking damages over an alleged cancer-causing effect of weedkillers Roundup or RangerPro, up from 13,400 in April.
Bayer has seen its market value slashed by more than 30 billion euros since August last year, when a California jury in the first such lawsuit found that Monsanto should have warned of the alleged cancer risks. 

Bayer, which says regulators and extensive research have found glyphosate to be safe, is banking on U.S. appeals courts to reverse or lessen the initial court rulings that have so far awarded tens of millions of dollars to each plaintiff.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's MYbank, an offshoot of  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), seeks to raise about 6 billion yuan ($871 million) in its maiden fundraising, valuing the online lender at 24 billion yuan, according to a source and a fundraising document seen by Reuters.
MYbank, backed by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group and Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd (HK:0656), plans to use the proceeds to boost its capital base and support lending to small businesses, said the person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Its capital adequacy ratio was 12.1% at the end of 2018 from 13.51% a year prior, its 2018 annual report showed. Chinese regulation dictates small, non-systematically important banks are subject to a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 10.5%.
Several existing shareholders including Ant and Fosun are looking to participate in the latest fundraising, said the person who declined to be identified as the information was not public.
MYbank, Ant and Fosun declined to comment. Bloomberg first reported MYbank's fundraising plans on Monday.
China's internet companies in recent years have increasingly encroached on areas served by traditional banks as the government encourages change in its stodgy and largely state-owned finance industry.
Launched in June 2015, MYbank is one of a handful of online lenders - along with Tencent Holdings Ltd's (HK:0700) WeBank - founded entirely with private investment.
MYbank has been seeking to expand its network to include more small businesses under-served by long-established financial institutions. Funding for such borrowers has traditionally been scarce as they have little to no collateral.
The bank had served 12.27 million small firms and private business owners, with an average outstanding loan of 26,000 yuan as at the end of last year, its annual report showed. It recorded net profit of 670 million yuan and revenue of 6.28 billion yuan.
Ahead of the fundraising, MYbank is 30% owned by Ant Financial which along with Alibaba has provided the lender with cloud-computing expertise and helped it with big data, artificial intelligence and facial recognition to facilitate lending, MYbank president https://reut.rs/2K3nRNJ has told Reuters.
Units of Fosun and auto parts supplier Wanxiang Group own 25% and 18% respectively.

(Reuters) - Beyond Meat Inc's (O:BYND) shares tumbled on Monday on plans for another stock offering just three months after its IPO while demand for its plant-based burgers and sausages prompted an increase in its full-year sales forecast.
Trading was volatile and shares fell more than 12% after hours on news of a 3.25 million share offering that includes 3 million shares from selling stockholders.
Proceeds are earmarked to raise funds to expand its manufacturing facilities that are being stretched by booming demand for its meat alternatives. Executives on a call with analysts declined to comment on the offering.
Beyond Meat's shares have surged over 780% since the IPO in May as the company's meat alternatives entered the menus of restaurants such as Carl's Jr and on shelves of grocers including  Kroger Co  (N:KR).
Plant-based meat alternatives have seen booming interest from consumers and restaurants, supporting startups like Beyond Meat and its competitor Impossible Foods, and even sparking interest from veteran meat companies such as  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and Perdue Foods, which now offer meat protein products mixed with plants.
""For another growth stock, the top-line beat and raises would be enough to see a post-market rally, but there are a lot of Beyond Meat investors out there looking for any excuse to sell a stock that has rocketed so much since its IPO,"" said Kamal Khan, analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.
Beyond Meat products are now sold at more than 53,000 retailers and restaurants worldwide, with demand boosted by the grilling season underway, Beyond Meat's CEO Ethan Brown said on Monday.
At supermarket chain Morton Williams (NYSE:WMB), which owns 16 locations across New York City, some customers are buying Beyond Meat burger patties and sausages by the case, according to Victor Colello, the chain's director of meat and fish.
""Beyond Meat is really flying off the shelves. My business with it has almost doubled and we're sold out at times,"" Colello said. The latest version of the burgers is made from peas, brown rice, sunflower seeds and mung beans.
Net revenue rose nearly four-fold to $67.3 million in the three months ended June 29, above Wall Street's estimate of $52.71 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The company said it expects net revenue to rise over 170% to $240 million in 2019, up from the prior $210 million it had forecast just last month.
The El Segundo, California-based company reported a net loss of $9.4 million, or a loss 24 cents per share, compared with a loss of $7.4 million, or a loss of $1.22 per share in the year-ago period.
NO SIGN OF SLOWING
Karen Formanski, an analyst at Mintel who authored a consumer research report on plant-based protein, said there were no signs of the meat alternatives market slowing, with 38% of U.S. consumers trying to add more plant-based protein to their diet.
""But with growing competition, criticism over processed food and clean eating getting more important, companies will have to adapt and offer more variety than just burgers"" Formanski said.
Brown on Monday rejected growing criticism over Beyond Meat's products being overly processed and unhealthy, saying it was not a question of whether they were processed but how.
The company seeks to further diversify its protein sources without relying on genetic modification, Brown said.
""There are an almost endless amount of crops you can pull from...and it is really important that Beyond is leading the effort of bringing new proteins into the market,"" Brown said.
The CEO said he was confident his company could take on competition from Impossible Foods, which relies on genetically modified soy seeds to produce its burger patties, because of consumers hesitancy surrounding those technologies.
Impossible Foods initially planned to roll out to retail stores this fall, but has continuously pushed back plans due to supply shortages.
Analysts during Monday's call pressed Beyond Meat executives for details on looming supply chain bottlenecks as demand continues to surge.
Brown said the company would expand its in-house manufacturing facilities in Missouri, buy new equipment, while continuing to outsource the packaging of its products by adding new partners.
""That's not to say we won't have some periodic disruptions that may create temporary shortages,"" the CEO said.
Brown said the company currently had a sufficient and continued supply of the protein it needs for its burgers, also thanks to the entry of larger players, including DuPont (N:DD), into the pea protein market.
Even so, the company has skeptics. Some 46% of the company's publicly traded shares are shorted, according to research group S3. Those investors, owning shares worth $1.1 billion, are betting on the company to miss its targets and the share price to drop."

The unrest potentially undermines both trust in governance and business confidence, two pillars which support Hong Kong’s AA+ rating at Fitch, the report said. The city’s “considerable” financial buffers are unlikely to be challenged in the near term, Fitch said. Fitch currently forecasts real gross domestic product growth of 1.6% in 2019.
Large scale protests have been taking place in the city since June, with the disruption escalating. Hong Kong’s MTR Corp. warned of delays Tuesday because of protesters crowding onto subway platforms and disrupting commuter trains, as the Asian financial hub’s protests stretched into the eighth week.
The report added that the ongoing tension could lead to “policy paralysis,” with regard to initiatives intended to bind the territory closer to the mainland, such as the Greater Bay Area plan.

Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index reached its highest level, having added about $240 billion in value this year as investors cheered a dovish central bank, a surprise federal election victory by the incumbent center-right government and skyrocketing iron ore prices.
The gauge rose as much as 0.7% to 6,875.5 in early trading on Tuesday, pushing past its all-time high from November 2007.
Up and Over
The decision by central banks around the world to pull back on interest rate hikes sparked a global equities rally amid bets that accommodative policies could bolster earnings. The Reserve Bank of Australia came out with back-to-back interest rate reductions in June and July, the first changes in policy since September 2016.
The coalition’s shock election win in May triggered a relief rally with the finance sector rising 12% as investors rejoiced that the opposition Labor Party wouldn’t be able to curtail tax breaks for property and stock-market investors. Health-care stocks advanced as the outcome thwarted plans to cap the amount they can raise premiums.
Skyrocketing iron ore prices also propelled the index higher. Benchmark prices for the steelmaking ingredient hit their highest in over five years, boosting miners including  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group, BHP Group Ltd. and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. But the good times might be over for the material -- analysts expect prices to ease after this year’s enormous gains.
Best and Worst
Communications services has been the best-performing sector this year. Technology was the next best, with the WAAAX stocks surging as investors seek exposure to the global rally that has sent U.S. tech equities soaring since 2017, followed by the miner-heavy materials.
The energy sector, which has advanced 14% this year, was the worst performer on the ASX 200, followed by utilities.
Magellan Financial Group Ltd. has been the top individual performer on the index, more than doubling in value amid a sustained surge in inflows. Produce company Costa Group Holdings Ltd. was the worst performer after cutting its guidance twice so far this year.
Where to Now?
Analysts disagree on where Aussie stocks will go after this year’s jump, with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management cheering the surge, and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). downgrading the market to underweight.

The country's second-largest full-fledged carrier does not currently have plans to discontinue any routes to Japan, but it is monitoring the situation, a spokesman at Asiana Airlines told Reuters. 
Asiana Airlines said it will fly smaller aircraft for three routes to Japan's Osaka, Fukuoka and Okinawa departing from the country's capital Seoul. 
Last month, Japan tightened controls of exports of high-tech materials to South Korea, in apparent retaliation for a South Korean court ruling over wartime forced labor. 
The ill-feeling has led to a widespread boycott of Japanese products and services, including air travel. 
But South Korea's airline and tourism firms have been also grappling with rising competition and falling travel demand to Japan - a destination that had been popular among younger tourists.
Korean visitors to Japan tripled over the last five years, and in 2018 accounted for 24.2% of total visitors, making them the second largest after visitors from China, according to Japan National Tourism Organisation data. But latest figures showed South Korean visitors during the first half of this year were 4% down on year-ago levels.
South Korea's top carrier  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) on Monday said it will suspend flights between the South Korean city of Busan and Japan's Sapporo from Sept. 3, citing lean demand.
Several budget carriers including T'way Air Co Ltd (KS:091810) and Eastar Jet will temporarily halt some of its Japan routes from September, but the decision was taken before the dispute started, industry sources said.
Asiana's share weakened by 0.2% on Tuesday while the broader KOSPI market (KS11) was up 0.7%. 
Investors in the share market have looked for South Korean firms that could benefit from a boycott of Japanese competitors.
On Tuesday, shares in Korean apparel maker TBH Global Co Ltd (KS:084870) and underwear maker  Sbw  Inc (KS:102280) both jumped nearly 30%, on expectations that they would sell more as a result of South Koreans shunning Uniqlo, owned by Japan's Fast Retailing Co Ltd (T:9983).

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2019 10:55PM ET</span>",Trade jitters running high at U.S. companies ahead of new U.S.-China talks,"By Caroline Valetkevitch and Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Worries about the U.S.-China trade war are running high during the current U.S. quarterly reporting season, with companies as diverse as Juniper Networks and O'Reilly Automotive bemoaning the consequences but saying they are finding ways to weather the storm.
Trade negotiations shift to Shanghai on Tuesday, with stock market investors sensitive to fallout from the year-long conflict and any signs that it could escalate.
Tariffs were mentioned in about a third of conference calls held by S&P 500 companies reporting their quarterly results through July 26, according to FactSet. The 71 firms flagging tariffs were up from the 50 companies discussing tariffs in the same time frame in the first-quarter season, but less than the 99 a year ago when tariffs were an emerging issue for U.S. corporations.
Many of those corporations outlined to investors their plans to minimize the impact of the trade war, which has added to uncertainty as they struggle with a sluggish global economy, including lackluster economies in Europe and Japan. 
Parts supplier O'Reilly Automotive said in its conference call last week that it raised the prices of its products to make up for higher costs related to the tariffs.
Network gear maker  Juniper Networks Inc  (NYSE:JNPR) on Thursday missed the mid-point of its margin guidance due to the tariffs, saying it expected pressure to continue, even as it manages its operating expenses to mitigate the damage. 
Of S&P 500 components that have reported their second-quarter earnings, export-focused companies have beaten analysts' expectations 77% of the time, while companies focused on the domestic economy have exceeded expectations just 66% of the time, according to an analysis by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
That suggests that export-oriented companies are feeling the trade war less than investors expected, said Patrick Palfrey, an earnings analyst at Credit Suisse.
""Trade is an exacerbating factor, as opposed to the primary driver of the slowdown,"" Palfrey said. 
S&P 500 earnings are expected to have risen just 0.6% in the second quarter from a year ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. A big part of the slowdown reflects tough comparisons with a year ago, when the U.S. tax cut package led to a 24.9% jump in second-quarter earnings.
Roughly 76% of the 222 companies that have reported as of Monday morning have beaten analysts' earnings expectations, in line with the recent trend.
Third-quarter earnings expectations have now turned negative, however, with earnings expected to decline 0.6% from a year ago, based on Refinitiv's data. 
Wall Street has reacted sharply over the past year to tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, variously suggesting progress and setbacks in settling the trade dispute. Buoyed by expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, but also suggesting investors are becoming less sensitive to uncertainty around the trade war, the S&P 500 has surged 20% year to date and hit record highs last week.
Mattel's stock has surged 16% since Thursday, when the toymaker's quarterly results beat expectations, while it warned about the impact of an escalation of the trade war.
""We are being watchful of the potential tariff that may be implemented, and if implemented, would impact the entire toy industry. We have contingency plans in place and we're working closely with the retailers to ensure that we are aligned on our approach to mitigate the tariffs,"" Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) CEO Ynon Kreiz said on a conference call last week.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor index has surged 38% in 2019, even as trade tensions and U.S. restrictions on sales to Chinese telecom Huawei make it harder to predict when U.S. chipmakers will recover from a global, cyclical downturn. 
Investors were surprised last week after Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) said that U.S.-China trade tensions were not hampering its ability to conduct business in China, while Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) said on Thursday that customers worried about potential tariffs on chips were preemptively buying processors.
""We really think the Q2 action was pulling from the second half into the first half,"" Intel CFO George Davis told Reuters following the earnings report. ""Depending on how the trade discussions go, there could be some additional activity there, but we're not expecting at the same level, if at all, during the third quarter. We're forecasting demand based on the signals we're getting from our customers.""

China recently signaled it would allow Chinese firms to make some tariff-free purchases of U.S. farm goods, while Washington has encouraged companies to apply for waivers to a national security ban on sales to Huawei.

The Minneapolis-based company opened at A$2.50 and was trading at A$2.20 per CHESS Depositary Interest, as of 0234 GMT, compared with an IPO price of A$1.22 a share.
Sezzle, which launched in 2017 and is yet to post a profit, hopes to use the A$43.6 million it raised from the initial public offering to fund growth in North America, according to its prospectus.
Sezzle's Australia listing comes at a time when its larger local peer Afterpay Touch Group Ltd (AX:APT) has been ordered to conduct an external audit by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre over anti-money-laundering laws. [nL4N23J50Z]
Despite the heightened regulatory attention in Australia, the buy-now-pay-later space is dotted with existing players such as Zip Co Ltd (AX:Z1P), FlexiGroup (AX:FXL) and Splitit Ltd (AX:SPT).
The broader market (AXJO) traded 0.4% firmer.
Afterpay's climb from a A$1 per share listing in 2016 to Monday's close of A$27.18, with the Australian company sitting at a market value of nearly A$7 billion ($4.83 billion), reflects investor confidence.
Sezzle, which only operates in the United States and Canada, said expansion plans are dependent on its performances in these two markets.
Buy-now-pay-later companies offer customers an alternative form of credit by letting them buy products in installments, especially to a burgeoning population of millennials worldwide, but this form of lending lacks the rigorous oversight that more orthodox forms of lending face.

The suspect, a 33-year-old former Seattle technology company software engineer identified as Paige Thompson, made her initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Seattle on Monday, the U.S. Attorney's office said.
According to a complaint filed in the District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle, Thompson posted information from her hack, which occurred between March 12 and July 17, on coding platform GitHub. Another user saw the post and notified Capital One of the breach.
Law enforcement officials were able to track Thompson down as the page she posted on contained her full name as part of its digital address, the complaint said. Capital One said it identified the hack on July 19. 
A representative for the U.S. Attorney's office said it was not immediately clear what the suspect's motive was. 
The incident is expected to cost between $100 million and $150 million in 2019, mainly because of customer notifications, credit monitoring and legal support, Capital One said.
The hacker did not gain access to credit card account numbers, but about 140,000 Social Security numbers and 80,000 linked bank account numbers were compromised, Capital One said. Other personal information accessed included phone numbers and credit scores.
About 1 million social insurance numbers of the company's Canadian credit card customers were also compromised.
The Capital One hacker was able to gain access to the data through a misconfigured web application firewall, the U.S. Attorney's office said.
Credit-reporting company  Equifax Inc  (N:EFX) said last week it would pay up to $700 million to settle claims it broke the law during a 2017 data breach when roughly 147 million people had information, including Social Security numbers and driver's license data, compromised.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2019 10:07PM ET</span>",Trump billionaire friend aimed to profit from Mideast nuclear deal: Democrats,"By Jonathan Landay and Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tom Barrack, a billionaire friend of U.S. President Donald Trump, pursued a plan to buy Westinghouse Electric Corp even as he lobbied Trump to become a special envoy to promote the building by the firm of nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia, said a congressional report released on Monday.
While Barrack failed in both efforts, the report provides fresh evidence of the ease with which some corporate and foreign interests have gained access to Trump and other senior members of his administration.
Documents obtained by the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee raise ""serious questions about whether the White House is willing to place the potential profits of the President's friends above the national security of the American people and the universal objective of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons,"" the report said.
The report is the second from the panel's investigation into the plan to construct 40 nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East. The plan was supported by Trump’s first national security adviser Michael Flynn, Barrack, Trump's inaugural committee chairman, and a consortium of firms led by retired U.S. military commanders and former White House officials called IP3.
One company was Westinghouse, the only U.S. manufacturer of large reactors, which was bought out of bankruptcy by Brookfield Asset Management last August.
The report comes alongside a number of other investigations into the administration being conducted by the panel chaired by Representative Elijah Cummings - including into the use of personal texts and emails for official business by Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner.
Trump attacked Cummings, an African American from Baltimore, in weekend tweets that the president’s critics denounced as racist.
Monday's report was based largely on thousands of documents provided by unidentified private companies. The White House, the report said, provided no documents, while other federal agencies submitted some.
The committee may subpoena White House documents, it said. 
Documents showed that Barrack negotiated with Trump and other White House officials to seek ""powerful positions,"" including special Middle East envoy, as he took steps to profit from the civil nuclear scheme he advocated.
A previous committee report, published in February, said efforts to advance the nuclear power scheme began during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. 
Trump officials have continued meeting with IP3 even though White House lawyers in January 2017 instructed staff to cease work on the plan over concerns that Flynn was breaking conflict of interest laws, according to that report. Flynn, fired by Trump in February 2017, advised IP3 while serving on his campaign and transition team, said both reports.
White House lawyers also worried that promoters of IP3's so-called ""Middle East Marshall Plan"" sought to transfer U.S. nuclear know-how to Saudi Arabia even as they pushed back on Riyadh's behalf against certain safeguards, the reports said. Known as the ""Gold Standard,"" the safeguards are designed to prevent nuclear weapons development. IP3 called the standard a ""total roadblock,"" Monday's report said.
Barrack has been cooperating with the oversight committee and provided it with requested documents, a spokesman said. Barrack's investments and business development in the region are for a ""better aligned Middle East,"" he said. ""This is not political it is essential.""
The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
IP3 said the report linked misunderstandings about the oversight over the transfer of nuclear energy technology to foreign nations with conspiracy theories and allegations ""to create an arbitrary and contrived story that doesn’t reflect the reality that occurred.""
EARLY INFLUENCE
Texts and emails showed that Barrack sought to shape Trump’s approach to Gulf Arab states early on by sharing a draft of a Trump campaign speech with Rashid al-Malik, an Emirati businessman. Malik circulated the draft to Emirati and Saudi officials, Monday's report said.
Barrack then shared Malik’s suggestions about the speech with Paul Manafort, a political consultant who chaired Trump’s campaign at the time, the report said. Manafort was convicted in 2018 of bank fraud and tax evasion in charges that grew out of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.
The New York Times on Sunday reported that federal prosecutors investigating foreign influence on Trump's campaign are examining Barrack's exchanges with Malik.
Neither Barrack, chairman of Colony Capital, a private equity firm, nor Malik are registered as lobbyists for foreign interests with the Justice Department.
Barrack, the report said, began communicating days before Trump’s inauguration with IP3 co-founder Robert ""Bud"" McFarlane, a national security adviser to the late President Ronald Reagan. In an email to Barrack following a Jan. 23, 2017, meeting, McFarlane said it would be fitting for Trump to name Barrack as his ""personal representative to promote the execution"" of the nuclear reactor scheme.
Documents also showed that in mid-2017, Barrack, his company and IP3 discussed purchasing Westinghouse out of bankruptcy in partnership with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, which is headed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and other investors, the report said.
Barrack ultimately failed, with two other U.S. investment firms, to purchase Westinghouse. 
But after Brookfield Asset Management announced in January 2018 its winning bid for the company, Barrack asked Brookfield Chief Executive Bruce Flatt whether he could join the venture, the report said. There is no evidence Barrack was successful. 
Days after buying Westinghouse, Brookfield announced it agreed to a 99-year lease on a Manhattan building owned by Kushner’s family - a deal that saved the Kushner Companies' property. 

The report also cites a series of documents showing how the nuclear power scheme was discussed between IP3, Barrack and senior administration officials. Those talks appear to have included a White House meeting between Trump, Barrack and other Colony employees on the same day that Trump met with the Saudi crown prince, on March 14, 2017 the report said.

BOC said 18 jets that had been due in the first half had been delayed, including 12 A320neos due primarily to industrial constraints and 6 737 MAXs as a result of the grounding.
For the full year, up to 7 A320neos and 23 737 MAXs could be delayed, including three for which an airline customer has the right to acquire upon delivery, Asia's second-biggest aircraft lessor said in a statement.
BOC said it was working with Boeing on a revised delivery timeframe.
Boeing last week estimated a return to service for the jet would begin early in the fourth quarter, but it did not rule out further reducing or temporarily shutting down production of the plane if that forecast needed to be revised.
U.S. carrier Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) last week removed the 737 MAX from its schedules until Jan. 5, 2020, saying it would need one to two months following regulatory approval to train pilots and prepare the jets for fresh commercial service."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. Democratic lawmakers on Monday criticized  Goodyear Tire  & Rubber Co (O:GT) for refusing to let them visit its Mexican plant, and said poor conditions there raised questions about Mexican labor reforms seen as key to ensuring passage of a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
Four of the nine House of Representatives Democrats who are negotiating with the Trump administration about the trade deal spelled out their concerns in a letter to Goodyear's chief executive, Richard Kramer.
""We are ... disappointed that an iconic American company like Goodyear .... is failing to provide its workers in Mexico with basic labor rights that are recognized internationally and under Mexican law,"" Representative Earl Blumenauer, chairman of the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, and three other Democrats wrote in the letter.
""While we are told that Mexico's labor reforms and a renewed NAFTA will lead to positive change in Mexico and in America, what we saw at Goodyear clearly illustrates the entrenched way of doing business in Mexico that is based on exploiting a powerless workforce,"" they said.
The Trump administration wants Congress to approve the trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement), but House Democrats say they will not proceed until their labor, climate, enforcement and pharmaceutical concerns are met.
No immediate comment was available from Goodyear on the letter. On Friday it said the need to train and certify workers, and pressure to achieve full production capacity by the end of year, meant it was able to host only ""limited outside visits.""
Blumenauer led a bipartisan congressional visit to Mexico from July 18-22. Democratic Representatives Rosa DeLauro, Terri Sewell and Jimmy Gomez were also on the trip and signed the letter.
They said they met with workers who were fired from the Goodyear plant and with Goodyear executives offsite, but were not permitted to visit the plant.
They asked the company to respond within two weeks to reports of ""poor working conditions, inadequate wages, illegal termination and discrimination"" at the facility, and to say how much of the output from the plant was sent to the United States.
Goodyear's San Luis Potosi plant opened in 2017, with wages ranging from $2 to $6 an hour, while most of Goodyear's U.S. workers receive a base rate of $23 per hour, the lawmakers said.
A wildcat strike at the Mexican plant in April 2018 included 600 of the 800 workers, the lawmakers said, adding that 57 of those who participated were later systematically fired."

Shares of the company traded marginally down at $132.47, after having closed up 1.7% on Monday. (https:// 
J&J (NYSE:JNJ) said that the FTC had issued a ""civil investigative demand,"" or CID, the equivalent of a subpoena to determine if the contracting practices were legal.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) filed a lawsuit against J&J in 2017, saying its rival’s contracts with health insurers for blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, were anticompetitive and aimed at blocking sales of Pfizer’s biosimilar called Inflectra.
Pfizer said in the lawsuit that J&J had contracted with many insurers to give discounts in exchange for giving preference to Remicade, and to only pay for Inflectra in cases where Remicade proved to be ineffective. Inflectra was approved in 2016 while Remicade went on the market in 1998.
Remicade is an infused treatment for chronic autoimmune disorders and costs about $4,000 per dose, or $26,000 a year, Pfizer said in the lawsuit.
J&J has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting the Pfizer lawsuit.
Pfizer said in a statement that it had received a CID in June. 
""As Pfizer’s complaint alleges, J&J’s unlawful conduct is designed to prevent Inflectra from being able to compete on its primary point of differentiation – price. Today, Inflectra has an average selling price (ASP) that is more than 22% lower than Remicade,"" the company said in a statement. ""Despite these facts, J&J has not lost substantial volume or share of sales – counter to what should occur in a competitive market.""
Biosimilars are intended to be lower-cost alternatives to expensive biotech medicines. But since they are made from living cells and it is not possible to make an exact copy of the branded medicine, they are not automatically substituted for the existing branded drug the way a generic drug would be.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) is bracing for attacks from Democratic presidential candidates at two debates that begin on Tuesday in Detroit near its headquarters.
The largest U.S. automaker preemptively released two fact sheets on its U.S. operations and details about its 2009 U.S. government bailout ahead of the debates, which could feature Democrats using its high-profile job cuts to attack U.S. President Donald Trump.
GM announced in November it would cut a total of about 15,000 jobs and end production at five North American plants, included eliminating about 8,000 salaried workers.
The company came under withering criticism from Trump and many members of Congress for the cuts, which came a decade after the company was rescued by a $50 billion U.S. government bailout.
One of the plants slated for closure, Warren Transmission, is just north of Detroit and will end operations on Wednesday. The last transmission was built on Friday but there is some remaining work this week for maintenance and service parts, GM said.
On Tuesday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez and Representative Dan Kildee will hold a press conference with workers across the street from the Warren plant ""to highlight Trump’s broken promises on the economy,"" the DNC said in a statement. In October 2016, Trump came to Warren and said: ""If I’m elected you won’t lose one plant… you’re going to have jobs again.""
The UAW plans a separate media event with Warren workers on Tuesday.
GM said the end of production “is an emotional time for our Warren Transmission team members” and emphasized it wants “them to stay with the company.” 
GM said last year that about 335 workers were employed at Warren Transmission, including 265 hourly workers. It said it has job opportunities for nearly all hourly employees at the plant and many have already transferred or accepted offers to transfer.
Warren is in Macomb County, which has historically been a key presidential electoral battleground in Michigan. Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 2016, or a 0.23% margin.
Another of the factories set to close, GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant, won a temporary reprieve in February when GM extended production into January 2020.
Of 2,800 U.S. hourly workers impacted by the decisions to end production at some plants, GM says it has placed more than 1,700 employees in jobs at other locations. 
In May, Trump praised GM's disclosure that it was in talks to sell an idled northeastern Ohio plant to cash-strapped electric truck-building Workhorse Group Inc (O:WKHS) and a new entity. The United Auto Workers has criticized that decision and some lawmakers have raised concerns about the plan.
In March, GM removed a Mexican-made Chevrolet Blazer from a display at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Park, where the Detroit Tigers play, after some workers objected.
""GM’s operations in Mexico are not a threat to U.S. jobs,"" one company fact sheets states, noting GM has invested $23 billion in U.S. operations since 2009 compared with $5 billion in Mexico.
The other fact sheet says GM ""repaid our debts, and we have invested tens of billions of dollars back into the United States since then.""

In 2014, the U.S. Treasury said it lost $11.2 billion on the GM bailout. The Treasury swapped most of its $50 billion U.S. loan to GM for a 61 percent equity stake, which it sold at a loss.

(Reuters) - Mylan NV's (O:MYL) planned merger with  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) off-patent branded drugs business may have boosted its share price on Monday, but one of its most pressing problems remains: shortages of its flagship EpiPen emergency allergy treatment.
For the past year, Mylan has been struggling to address an ongoing EpiPen shortage that could potentially worsen as thousands of school children with allergies need to restock EpiPen supplies ahead of the school year.
Now, the planned tie-up will bring together two businesses that have long collaborated on making EpiPens. For years, Pfizer has manufactured EpiPen on Mylan's behalf through its Meridian Medical Technologies unit.
It was not yet clear if the combination will help ease the shortages by simplifying the company's complex manufacturing processes.
Although Meridian will not be merged with Mylan as part of the transaction announced on Monday, the companies were in talks to transfer Meridian to the newly created generics business, a Pfizer spokeswoman said.
The discussions are still ongoing and there is no guarantee that a deal will be reached, but the parties are aiming to reach a final decision before the close of the larger Pfizer-Mylan deal in 2020, Pfizer said.
""We’ve had some conversations with Mylan about that potentially transferring to Mylan as a supplement to the existing transaction, but nothing has been finalized to date yet,"" Frank D'Amelio, Pfizer's chief financial officer told Reuters.
If the company is transferred to the new Mylan-Pfizer spinoff, it could potentially help streamline a fix to the manufacturing issues that have led to shortages.
“Over the long term, having all EpiPen operations under one unified company would reduce complexity,"" said Ashtyn Evans, an Edward Jones analyst.
Meridian, which produces all EpiPens sold globally at a single plant near St. Louis, has been hit by a series of manufacturing problems since at least 2018 that resulted in shortages in the United States and elsewhere. The company said in early July it anticipates further supply shortages over the coming months.
Canada's national health agency said earlier this month it continued to experience EpiPen shortages as well.
Mylan, a generic drugmaker that came under fire from mothers and politicians over steep EpiPen price hikes, has been facing new competition for its emergency allergy treatment.
Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries (TA:TEVA) has launched its own EpiPen generic, and other companies including  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN), Kaleo Inc and Amneal Pharmaceuticals Inc (N:AMRX) also are in the market with rival products."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Mylan NV (O:MYL) surged on Monday after the generic drugmaker agreed to combine with  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) off-patent branded drugs business. But in the bigger picture, the surge is lost in a bleaker landscape for Mylan's stock price and the broader generic drug industry since 2015.
Mylan shares have been in decline for the past four years, after topping $76 in April 2015, according to Refinitiv data. On Monday, the shares closed at $20.78, a more-than 70% decline from that 2015 peak.
This year alone, Mylan shares had lost one-third of their value through Friday, before news broke of the Pfizer tie-up.
Graphic: Mylan share price - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Mq7Ym6
Mylan is far from alone when it comes to share price swoons for generic drugmakers, which broadly have seen severe declines over the past several years. 
""You have seen very challenging valuations for these companies and I think Pfizer sees that as an opportunity,” said Kevin Kedra, an analyst with G. Research. ""Mylan is essentially issuing them stock at a depressed level.""
U.S.-traded shares of Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries (TA:TEVA) have tumbled nearly 90% since peaking four years ago. Teva sought to buy Mylan in the summer of 2015, but Mylan successfully resisted Teva's unsolicited bid.
Shares of other makers of generic drugs, such as  Perrigo Co  Plc (N:PRGO), Amneal Pharmaceuticals Inc (N:AMRX) and Endo International Plc (O:ENDP), have also skidded.

Their struggles since the start of 2015 contrasts with a climb of more than 45% for the overall S&P 500 (SPX) as well as with a more modest 11% gain for the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index of U.S. and European drug stocks (DRG). 
Graphic: Generic drug stocks versus market - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ylfNkz
While the companies each have their specific issues, a main culprit afflicting the industry broadly has been pricing pressure in the United States, partly due to buyers having gained more negotiating power, analysts said.
Generic drug revenue in North America has declined about 50% in roughly the past four years, predominantly driven by pricing declines, according to Soo Romanoff, an analyst at Morningstar.
Earnings for many generic drug companies have stagnated or struggled as their share prices have fallen over the past four years.
Graphic: Sickly generic drugmaker profits - https://tmsnrt.rs/2MpQMgy
Many companies have also faced regulatory and legal uncertainty, analysts said, including lawsuits related to the U.S. opioid abuse epidemic and to alleged price-fixing for generic drugs.
At the same time, high leverage also hurt the outlook for the companies, including from debt related to acquisitions as the sector consolidated.
""It kind of created this storm where they couldn’t issue equity to reduce their leverage,"" Kedra said. ""All of a sudden, these companies were in declining businesses with high leverage and Wall Street is breathing down their neck.”

1. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AMD Earnings on Deck
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivers fiscal third-quarter results Tuesday after the closing bell, closing the curtains on the quarterly earnings season for big tech.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to report earnings of $2.09 a share on revenue of $53.3 billion, down from $2.34 in earnings on revenue of $53.3 billion a year ago.
As well as the usual earnings and guidance, Apple's services segment - iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store, among other apps - will be closely watched as the tech giant strives to reduce its dependence on iPhone sales, which make up about 60% of total revenue.
Goldman Sachs, citing data from Sensor Tower, expressed caution on the iPhone maker's services revenue amid signs of slowing App-Store growth.
""In revenue terms Sensor Tower indicates iOS App Store revenue growth of 14% Y/Y in June down from 18% year-on-year in May, 21% in April and 22% in March,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note on July 16.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), meanwhile, also reports earnings after the closing bell Tuesday.
The chipmaker's report comes amid a better-than-expected PC environment and a more sanguine backdrop for the broader sector in the wake of a string of positive updates from semis, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
AMD is expected to report earnings of 8 cents a share on revenue of $1.52 billion, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. That would be down from 14 cents a share on revenue of $1.76 billion a year ago. The chipmaker's guidance will also be closely watched, with investors eager to see if the company remains on track to meet management's guidance for high-single-digit year-on-year growth.
Merck, Pfizer and Procter & Gamble are the other notable names slated to report earnings before markets open.
2. Health of U.S. Consumer, Housing in Spotlight 
The health of the consumer, the backbone of the recent strength seen in U.S. economy, will be in the spotlight once again with consumer confidence and spending on the calendar.
Personal income for June is forecast to have slowed to 0.3% from 0.5% in the prior month while personal spending is expected to also have slowed 0.3% from 0.4%.
The Conference Board at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT) is expected to report consumer confidence jumped to a reading of 125 in July from 121.5.
Housing also will garner attention, with the National Association of Realtors expected to issue its monthly measure of pending home sales at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that homes under contract to be sold in June slowed to rise 0.5% in June from 1.1% the previous month.
3. API Crude Inventory Data Ahead 
The American Petroleum Institute’s data due tomorrow will provide traders with an early insight into whether U.S. crude supplies are set to extend their six-week decline.
The API reported last week that domestic crude supplies fell by 10.961 million barrels.
The data comes as investors await US-China trade talks that are set to resume this week in Shanghai, with analysts warning that oil prices may fall in the weeks ahead should the talks not bear fruit.
""Even with Iran's escalating activity in the Strait of Hormuz and a large draw in U.S. oil inventories, oil markets weren't able to push higher, suggesting there may be more downside in the weeks ahead,"" said GasBuddy petroleum analyst Patrick DeHaan.
""Concerns still abound over the lack of a China/U.S. trade deal,"" he added.

1299,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 29, 2019 05:10PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Boeing Slips as Doubts Fly in Over Credit Rating,"Investing.com – Boeing slid on Monday on worries that the ongoing 737 MAX crisis will likely continue to burn a hole in the aircraft maker's coffers leaving its credit rating vulnerable to a cut. 
Analysts at Standard & Poor's warned that it may cut its credit rating for Boeing (NYSE:BA) as the ongoing crisis with its 737 MAX fleet, which has remained grounded for months following two fatal crashes, could cause the company's financial position to deteriorate in the months ahead, causing its ratio of cash flow to debt to reach a level that usually triggers a downgrade. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) slipped 1.2% to $340.87 at 1:52 pm ET (17:52 GMT). The decline subtracted nearly 28 points from the Dow. The 737 MAX woes have cut Boeing's stock return this year from 38% before the grounding to less than 6%. 
The update comes after the company earlier in the day detailed plans to raise funds through a six-part bond offering later this year, with rival credit rating agency Fitch Ratings also flagging concerns about the Boeing's rising debt owing to the ongoing 737 crisis. 
Boeing's debt could rise above $24 billion before the end of the year ""as a result of working capital build up related to the 737 MAX grounding, but this will begin to decline once deliveries resume,"" Fitch Ratings said
The bond offering is expected to put any possible stock buybacks on the back burner, analysts said. 
The negative day for Boeing comes a week after the company recorded its biggest quarterly loss and said it expects its 737 MAX jets to return to service by early in the fourth quarter. But the company warned it could further cut or suspend production of its bestselling planes on further delays.
Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY), the Irish budget airline, said it has cut its growth targets in half for next year, scrapped 30,000 planned flights and could close bases and cut jobs if the return of the 737 MAX is delayed into next year. 
Looking to the second half of the year, analysts at Stifel have signaled out order activity as the key factor to watch as traffic growth has slowed this year. 
""We believe there is still significant risk associated with the MAX (return to service) RTS and headline risk as Boeing navigates the re-certification process,"" Stifel said in a note last week. 
""(S)entiment on the health of the commercial cycle has been weakening as traffic growth has slowed in 2019, and order activity has been muted. We believe order activity will be the most important factor for broader sector sentiment in H2/19,"" it added."
1300,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2019 04:57PM ET</span>",Boeing to Sell $5.5 Billion of Bonds for Brazil Embraer JV,"(Bloomberg) -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. is selling $5.5 billion of bonds to help finance its joint venture with Embraer SA as the companies seek to build smaller commercial planes together.
The airplane manufacturer is selling senior unsecured bonds in six parts, according to a filing Monday. The longest portion of the offering, a 40-year security, will yield 1.4 percentage points more than Treasuries, after initially discussing around 1.55 percentage points, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.
The bond sale comes as Boeing faces the fallout of a global grounding of its 737 Max plane. Boeing said last week it will consider slowing or even temporarily halting production of the 737 Max, the company’s most important jetliner, if a global flying ban drags on longer than anticipated. The company this month also revealed a $4.9 billion after-tax charge to compensate airlines and lessors.
The bond offering should carry attractive concessions despite expectations of tightening from the initial price talk, CreditSights analysts led by Ashwin Tiruvasu wrote in a note Monday. They maintained their outperform recommendation on the planemaker’s debt, noting that they view downside risk already priced in at current secondary levels.
Embraer, based in Brazil, received approval from its shareholders in February for the joint venture with Boeing, which is expected to help the two companies better compete with Airbus SE. The joint venture is on track to close by the end of this year, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a July 24 earnings call.
Credit Risk
The grounding of its best-selling jet has put Boeing’s credit rating at risk. Both Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings cut their outlooks to negative last week. S&P Global Ratings wrote in February that it was keeping its BBB rating on Embraer on credit watch with negative implications because of the complexity of the transaction and the large number of stakeholders involved.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, Royal Bank of Canada, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). are managing the bond sale, according to the filing.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) is combining its stock trading business with its prime brokerage unit, which caters to hedge funds, private equity firms and other investors. 
The New-York based bank will also lay off hundreds of equity and fixed-income traders globally in response to weak revenue trends, according to a Bloomberg report that cited sources familiar with the matter. 
A Citi spokesman declined to comment on the reported layoffs. 
The new unit, named Equities and Securities Services, will be co-led by Dan Keegan, Okan Pekin and Murray Roos. Keegan will also become head of markets and securities services for North America. 
""As the industry continues to consolidate and margin pressures intensify, clients are looking for solutions that deliver best-in-class services,"" co-heads of markets and securities services Carey Lathrop and Andy Morton wrote in an internal email seen by Reuters.
""We believe that now is the time to create an integrated offering supporting the pre-trade, execution and post-trade requirements of our clients,"" they wrote.
The combined business will include broad trading and execution capabilities in addition to financing, hedging, clearing, and custody services, the memo said.
In its second-quarter results reported earlier this month, Citi's trading revenue remained challenged for a third consecutive quarter, with fixed-income trading down 4%, excluding a gain from Citi's investment in Tradeweb, and equities revenue down 9%.
Many other banks already have combined such units. 

Citi's markets and securities services division has been shaken up in recent months as the bank streamlines businesses to better serve the evolving needs to clients. Last month, Citi combined its Foreign Exchange & Local Markets and G10 currencies businesses into one unit.

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2019 03:23PM ET</span>",Pfizer to merge generics unit with Mylan; seeks to sharpen cancer focus,"By Michael Erman and Ankur Banerjee
(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) has agreed to spin off its off-patent branded drugs business and combine it with generic drugmaker Mylan NV (O:MYL), a move that leaves Pfizer with its more profitable innovative drugs, including cancer treatment Ibrance and pneumonia vaccine Prevnar.
The move, which brings blockbuster treatments Viagra and Lipitor under one umbrella with Mylan's EpiPen, is part of a years-long effort by Pfizer to split into three parts - innovative medicines, lower margin off-patent drugs facing generic competition and consumer healthcare. Pfizer agreed in December to combine its consumer health business with GlaxoSmithKline Plc's. (L:GSK) 
The combined company, which will get a new name, is expected to have 2020 revenue of $19 billion to $20 billion, with free cash flow expected to be more than $4 billion.
The pharmaceutical industry has been under intensifying pressure from lawmakers, including President Donald Trump, to keep prices down for U.S. consumers, which has limited profits and led to recent deals, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (N:BMY) plan to buy  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG) and AbbVie Inc's (N:ABBV) acquisition of Allergan Plc (N:AGN).
The new company, to be based in the United States and incorporated in Delaware, will be led by Michael Goettler, president of Pfizer's Upjohn unit, which sells Pfizer's older drugs that have lost patent protection.
Upjohn will issue $12 billion of debt at or before the separation, with proceeds going to Pfizer. Pfizer said it plans to use that cash to pay down its own debt.
Mylan said Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who took the helm in 2012 and faced intense political pressure over the high price of EpiPen, will retire after the deal closes. Mylan Chairman Robert Coury will become executive chairman of the new company.
""We think it is clear Mylan needed to do something to change direction,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst David Maris said, adding that the deal is also recognition that Pfizer wanted out of generics.
Pfizer's older drugs business has a much higher operating margin than Mylan's, Maris added.
Mylan, which had a market value of $9.5 billion prior to Monday's announcement, last year said it would review its business as it grapples with lower prices of generic drugs and declining sales of its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment.
In 2015, Mylan fended off a takeover attempt from rival Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries (TA:TEVA) that would have valued the company at around $40 billion. Based on Monday's share price, the company is worth around $11 billion. EpiPen sales fell sharply after Mylan was heavily criticized for steep price hikes on its device that delivers a life-saving shot epinephrine to treat severe allergic reactions. Bresch was called to testify before Congress in 2016, as the controversy put Mylan at the center of the ongoing U.S. debate over the high cost of prescription medicines.
Mylan's shares have lost about a third of their value in 2019 through Friday's close. The stock was up more than 12.9% at $20.84 on Monday, while Pfizer slipped 2% to $42.23.
Graphic: Mylan shares - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ykeLFF
STREAMLINED PFIZER
Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and his predecessor Ian Read have been saying for more than a year that the company would eschew large, transformative deals because of confidence in the strength of its pipeline. 
But if the Mylan and GSK deals both close, the company will have shed two large businesses to tighten its focus on newer, patent-protected innovative medicines. 
Pfizer CFO Frank D'Amelio said on a conference call that the streamlined company will grow sooner and faster beginning in 2020 than it would have otherwise. 
Under terms of the agreement, Pfizer shareholders will own 57% of the new company and Mylan shareholders the rest. Each Mylan share will be converted into one share of the new company under the all-stock deal.
Revenue from the Upjohn unit in the second quarter was $2.81 billion, accounting for a fifth of Pfizer's total sales. Mylan brought in revenue of $2.85 billion in the same quarter.
Pfizer, which acquired Upjohn as part of its 2002 purchase of Pharmacia for $60 billion, will separate Upjohn in a tax-free spinoff and combine with Mylan.
Once the deal closes, the new company will have about $24.5 billion of total debt outstanding.

Separately, Pfizer reported its quarterly results on Monday, a day earlier than planned. The company cut its profit and revenue forecast for the year, largely due to the joint venture with GSK last year.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2019 03:11PM ET</span>",Germany's Bayer dealt new legal blow as more Brazil farmers challenge soy patent,"By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Germany's  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn), which completed the takeover of U.S.-based  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) last year, has been dealt a legal blow in Brazil as more farmers joined a lawsuit challenging the protection of a key soy seed patent.
A Brasília appeals court authorized producers from another 10 states to join Mato Grosso state farmers as plaintiffs in a case challenging the validity of Monsanto's Intacta RR2 PRO patent, according to court filings.
That means Bayer, which had been ordered to deposit royalties received from the Mato Grosso growers in an escrow account, will have to do the same with royalties from the new plaintiffs, said Sidney Pereira de Souza Jr, an attorney representing the soy growers who cited court decisions granted in July 26 and on Feb. 25.
The Mato Grosso farmers sued Monsanto, now Bayer, in late 2017 aiming to cancel the Intacta patent, which they claim lacks any real technological innovations.
The legal dispute underscores the operating risks for firms like Bayer in Brazil, where companies face the prospect of more such lawsuits, Souza said.
Recently, Brazilian cotton growers challenged Bayer's patent protection for the Bollgard II RR Flex seed.
Souza said Brazil's farmers are ""more organized"" and are increasingly demanding to know whether the technology they are buying is new.
Royalties from Intacta sales in Mato Grosso were an estimated 800 million reais ($211 million) per harvest, Souza said. When royalties from farmers in the other 10 states are accounted for, the amount to be deposited in a judicial account could rise to as much as 2.7 billion reais, he said.
A Bayer spokeswoman said the company did not have a specific comment on the latest court ruling because it has not been formally notified of the decision.
She said it has been depositing royalties paid by the Mato Grosso farmers relative to the 2017/2018 crop cycle in an escrow account as ordered by the lower court overseeing the case in July 2018.
Mato Grosso growers claim Bayer has only deposited an estimated 4% of the royalties they paid. Souza said the latest court ruling reiterated a prior decision obliging the firm to deposit 100%.
Bayer declined to say how much it has deposited.
Intacta's patent protection extends through October 2022."

MILAN (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) has reached a provisional deal with Italian prosecutors to pay 3 million euros ($3.3 million) to settle a money-laundering investigation, two sources said, in a move to end one of its biggest legal headaches in Europe.
The bank has been grappling with two separate investigations in Italy and a court case in France over allegations it enabled cross-border tax cheats to hide assets in Switzerland.
The proposed money-laundering settlement, known as an ""agreed penalty"", has yet to be confirmed by a judge but it has already been backed by Milan prosecutors and has a strong chance of being approved, said the sources familiar with the matter.
Last month, UBS settled its other Italian case, a related financial investigation, with tax authorities for 101 million euros.
No charges have been laid against UBS in the money-laundering investigation which began in late 2017.
UBS declined to comment.
The settlement would go before a judge in the autumn, the sources said. UBS had already deposited in a Milan court's bank account 10 million euros that the judge is expected to confiscate as profit of alleged money-laundering, they added.
The settlement would apply only to potential charges against the bank's parent group, UBS AG, and two subsidiaries, UBS Switzerland and UBS Monaco, the sources said, adding that each company would pay an agreed settlement of 1 million euros.
Prosecutors allege that unidentified UBS managers were responsible for money-laundering because they invested client funds that were the fruit of tax evasion.
Last week, the Swiss Supreme Court ruled that data about 40,000 UBS clients must be handed to French tax authorities in a landmark case that could set a precedent for foreign governments seeking information from Swiss banks.
In France, UBS is appealing a 4.5 billion euros penalty for alleged tax evasion. UBS has denied wrongdoing."

(Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said on Monday it has fined Citigroup's Global Markets business $1.25 million for failing to perform proper background checks on thousands of employees between 2010 and 2017.
According to the regulator, the New York-based bank did not conduct ""timely or adequate"" background checks for roughly 10,400 non-registered employees. As a result, it said, the bank employed at least three individuals with criminal histories, in violation of regulatory requirements.
FINRA requires most employees at the broker-dealer firms it regulates to be finger-printed and screened for past criminal history regardless of whether the employee will be registered with FINRA to be involved in investment decisions.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Inc is a member of FINRA and self-reported the issue to the regulator.
While Citi had strict procedures in place to screen employees who were registered or intended to become registered, the bank had looser procedures for non-registered employees, FINRA found.
Citi, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, neither admitted nor denied the charges. A Citi representative said the bank is pleased to have the matter resolved."

MILAN (Reuters) - An Italian judge has rejected a request by prosecutors to shelve a false accounting case against former executives at bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS), which had to be bailed out by the state.
The case revolves around allegations that the three former executives failed to properly book bad loan provisions between 2012 and 2015 and stems from a complaint presented by the bank's small shareholders.
Monte dei Paschi, the world's oldest bank, had to request state aid at the end of 2016 after an attempt to raise capital on the market failed. The Italian state retains a stake of around 68% in the bank.
Small shareholders argue that documents used by the bank as it sought to convince investors to buy into two successive capital increases in 2014 and 2015 did not provide an accurate picture of the lender's real financial situation.
In his ruling, dated July 25 and seen by Reuters on Monday, judge Guido Salvini told Milan prosecutors to investigate the allegations further and gave them nine months to do so. The prosecutors were not initially convinced that the case was strong enough to pursue.
The case raises questions about Monte dei Paschi's health before it was bailed out by the government and whether the rescue, approved by European authorities and costing the taxpayer 5.4 billion euros ($6 billion), respected EU rules on dealing with banking crises.
The executives under investigation are Monte dei Paschi's former Chairman Alessandro Profumo, its former Chief Executive Fabrizio Viola and the former head of the bank's team of internal auditors, Paolo Salvadori.
Lawyers for Profumo and Viola declined to comment on the case. A lawyer for Salvadori did not respond to a request for comment.
In its ruling, the judge refers to a confidential report by the European Central Bank dated June 2, 2017 following an audit of the bank by its inspectors the previous year.
The report, seen by Reuters, found that a lot of loans deemed to be performing had in fact turned sour and that the bank had failed to set aside sufficient funds to cover for loan losses.
It said that based on an estimate submitted by the bank on Dec. 13, 2016, the lender's CET 1 ratio - a key measure of financial strength - would have been just 0.58% at the end of 2015 after taking into account the results of the inspection, compared with a minimum regulatory requirement of 4.5%.
A month after the ECB inspectors' report, the European Commission authorized the government in Rome to rescue Monte dei Paschi with taxpayer money, saying it had been reassured by the ECB that the bank was solvent and respected minimum capital requirements.
An ECB spokeswoman declined to comment."

Woodford, one of Britain's best-known money managers, suspended the equity income fund on June 3 after being unable to meet redemption requests, sparking an outcry among investors and prompting an investigation by the country's markets watchdog.
In a letter to investors posted on its website, Link said it believed a suspension until December would give the manager time to reposition the fund's portfolio into more liquid assets, in order to give money back to clients that seek to leave when the suspension is lifted.
Link has to review the suspension every 28 days and communicate its decision to investors.
Famed for delivering returns by avoiding the tech bubble in the early 2000s and dodging a hit from the financial crisis several years later, Woodford now faces being sacked from managing the assets of his namesake listed investment fund.
The company board of  Woodford Patient Capital Trust  (L:WPCT) has the ability to appoint another manager to run the assets and said on Monday it was considering offers from ""third parties"" to do just that.

(Reuters) - Exact Sciences Corp (O:EXAS) said on Monday it will buy peer  Genomic Health  Inc (O:GHDX) for about $2.8 billion in cash and stock, expanding the cancer diagnostic company's testing capabilities to breast and prostate cancers. 
The deal will bring together Exact Sciences' non-invasive stool screening test for colorectal cancer Cologuard, and Genomic Health's Oncotype diagnostic tests for various cancers.
Genomic Health would help expand Exact Sciences' focus from screening into treatment selection as well as monitoring, which are highly attractive markets, Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro said. 
Under terms of the deal, Genomic Health stockholders will receive $27.50 in cash and $44.50 in Exact Sciences stock, for a total value of $72 per share.
Shares of Genomic Health rose 2.7% to $70.51 in early trading, while Exact Sciences' shares fell 12.1% to $103.6.
Massaro said while the merger makes sense over time, investors may not like the deal right away due to the lack of commercial synergies. 
That is because Exact Sciences caters primarily to primary care physicians, while Genomic Health targets oncologists, surgeons, pathologists, and urologists, he added.
Exact Sciences will also gain access to Genomic Health's oncology sales force, that would help it achieve its goal of capturing about 40% of the U.S. colorectal cancer screening market from a current market share of about 6%.
Colorectal cancer testing represents a $15 billion opportunity in the U.S., according to Exact Sciences.
""We have a one plus one equals three here... We're looking at a potential combined market opportunity of $20 billion total, of which less than 10% (is) penetrated today,"" Genomic Health Chief Executive Officer Kimberly Popovits said on a conference call.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Research analyst Dan Leonard called the purchase price fair, adding that he does not see a rival bid or any risk to the deal's completion.
The company said the deal does not have any impact on its partnership with  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), inked last year, under which the drugmaker agreed to share marketing expenses and co-promote Cologuard.
Separately, Exact Sciences posted second-quarter revenue of $199.9 million, a 94% increase from the prior year, as Cologuard test volumes nearly doubled.

The deal, expected to close by end-2019, is estimated to yield about $25 million in cost synergies within the third year, the companies said in a statement.

(Reuters) -  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) shares rose more than 15% to a record high on Monday after it said it was in talks to buy financial data firm Refinitiv, in a deal worth $27 billion including debt.
The proposed deal, which would turn LSE into a global player in financial data and expand its footprint in foreign exchange and fixed income, comes less than a year after Blackstone (N:BX) bought a majority stake in Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI), which valued it at $20 billion.
LSE's shares were 15% higher at 6,520 pence at 1110 GMT on Monday after hitting a record high of 6,562 pence, taking them to the top of London's bluechip index (FTSE).
Thomson Reuters, the parent company of Reuters, holds a 45% stake in Refinitiv. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that if the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced this week.
LSE shareholder Royal London Asset Management (RLAM) said it was right the exchange expanded further into data, but that it wanted more information about Refinitiv's business lines. 
""We are eager to hear more from management as to their quality and ability to integrate them,"" Mike Fox, head of sustainable investments at RLAM, holds 0.98% of LSE, said in an email.
Refinitiv's bonds, issued when Blackstone bought Thomson Reuters' Financial and Risk business to form Refinitiv, rallied across the curve on Monday. 
For example, a senior unsecured US dollar November 2026 bond <31740LAC7=> rose 5 cents on the dollar to 109.5, sending the yield – which moves inversely to price – to 5.4791% from 7% at the end of last week.
Refinitiv had $12.2 billion in debt as of the end of December as a result of its leveraged buyout by Blackstone, which LSE would assume under the proposed deal.
(GRAPHIC - Exchanges Race To Grow: https://tmsnrt.rs/2yiGjex)
A merger with Refinitiv would significantly expand LSE's information services business, which the bourse operator has been building as a more stable source of cash flow than its primary transaction-reliant businesses.
JP Morgan analysts said the deal would be strategically sensible, and in line with the LSE's strategy to focus on deals that extend into growth areas such as data and analytics and to complement existing businesses.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2019 11:21AM ET</span>",Italian judge rejects request to drop case against former Monte Paschi executives,"By Emilio Parodi and Silvia Aloisi
MILAN (Reuters) - An Italian judge has rejected a request by prosecutors to shelve a false accounting case against former executives at bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS), which had to be bailed out by the state.
The case revolves around allegations that the three former executives failed to properly book bad loan provisions between 2012 and 2015 and stems from a complaint presented by the bank's small shareholders.
Monte dei Paschi, the world's oldest bank, had to request state aid at the end of 2016 after an attempt to raise capital on the market failed. The Italian state retains a stake of around 68% in the bank.
Small shareholders argue that documents used by the bank as it sought to convince investors to buy into two successive capital increases in 2014 and 2015 did not provide an accurate picture of the lender's real financial situation.
In his ruling, dated July 25 and seen by Reuters on Monday, judge Guido Salvini told Milan prosecutors to investigate the allegations further and gave them nine months to do so. The prosecutors were not initially convinced that the case was strong enough to pursue.
The case raises questions about Monte dei Paschi's health before it was bailed out by the government and whether the rescue, approved by European authorities and costing the taxpayer 5.4 billion euros ($6 billion), respected EU rules on dealing with banking crises.
The executives under investigation are Monte dei Paschi's former Chairman Alessandro Profumo, its former Chief Executive Fabrizio Viola and the former head of the bank's team of internal auditors, Paolo Salvadori.
Lawyers for Profumo and Viola declined to comment on the case. A lawyer for Salvadori did not respond to a request for comment.
In its ruling, the judge refers to a confidential report by the European Central Bank dated June 2, 2017 following an audit of the bank by its inspectors the previous year.
The report, seen by Reuters, found that a lot of loans deemed to be performing had in fact turned sour and that the bank had failed to set aside sufficient funds to cover for loan losses.
It said that based on an estimate submitted by the bank on Dec. 13, 2016, the lender's CET 1 ratio - a key measure of financial strength - would have been just 0.58% at the end of 2015 after taking into account the results of the inspection, compared with a minimum regulatory requirement of 4.5%.
A month after the ECB inspectors' report, the European Commission authorized the government in Rome to rescue Monte dei Paschi with taxpayer money, saying it had been reassured by the ECB that the bank was solvent and respected minimum capital requirements.
An ECB spokeswoman declined to comment."

Woodford, one of Britain's best-known money managers, suspended the equity income fund on June 3 after being unable to meet redemption requests, sparking an outcry among investors and prompting an investigation by the country's markets watchdog.
In a letter to investors posted on its website, Link said it believed a suspension until December would give the manager time to reposition the fund's portfolio into more liquid assets, in order to give money back to clients that seek to leave when the suspension is lifted.
Link has to review the suspension every 28 days and communicate its decision to investors.
Famed for delivering returns by avoiding the tech bubble in the early 2000s and dodging a hit from the financial crisis several years later, Woodford now faces being sacked from managing the assets of his namesake listed investment fund.
The company board of  Woodford Patient Capital Trust  (L:WPCT) has the ability to appoint another manager to run the assets and said on Monday it was considering offers from ""third parties"" to do just that.
Woodford put gates up on the fund after being unable to meet redemption requests totaling nearly 300 million pounds."

(Reuters) - Exact Sciences Corp (O:EXAS) said on Monday it will buy peer  Genomic Health  Inc (O:GHDX) for about $2.8 billion in cash and stock, expanding the cancer diagnostic company's testing capabilities to breast and prostate cancers. 
The deal will bring together Exact Sciences' non-invasive stool screening test for colorectal cancer Cologuard, and Genomic Health's Oncotype diagnostic tests for various cancers.
Genomic Health would help expand Exact Sciences' focus from screening into treatment selection as well as monitoring, which are highly attractive markets, Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro said. 
Under terms of the deal, Genomic Health stockholders will receive $27.50 in cash and $44.50 in Exact Sciences stock, for a total value of $72 per share.
Shares of Genomic Health rose 2.7% to $70.51 in early trading, while Exact Sciences' shares fell 12.1% to $103.6.
Massaro said while the merger makes sense over time, investors may not like the deal right away due to the lack of commercial synergies. 
That is because Exact Sciences caters primarily to primary care physicians, while Genomic Health targets oncologists, surgeons, pathologists, and urologists, he added.
Exact Sciences will also gain access to Genomic Health's oncology sales force, that would help it achieve its goal of capturing about 40% of the U.S. colorectal cancer screening market from a current market share of about 6%.
Colorectal cancer testing represents a $15 billion opportunity in the U.S., according to Exact Sciences.
""We have a one plus one equals three here... We're looking at a potential combined market opportunity of $20 billion total, of which less than 10% (is) penetrated today,"" Genomic Health Chief Executive Officer Kimberly Popovits said on a conference call.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Research analyst Dan Leonard called the purchase price fair, adding that he does not see a rival bid or any risk to the deal's completion.
The company said the deal does not have any impact on its partnership with  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), inked last year, under which the drugmaker agreed to share marketing expenses and co-promote Cologuard.
Separately, Exact Sciences posted second-quarter revenue of $199.9 million, a 94% increase from the prior year, as Cologuard test volumes nearly doubled.

The deal, expected to close by end-2019, is estimated to yield about $25 million in cost synergies within the third year, the companies said in a statement.

(Reuters) -  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) shares rose more than 15% to a record high on Monday after it said it was in talks to buy financial data firm Refinitiv, in a deal worth $27 billion including debt.
The proposed deal, which would turn LSE into a global player in financial data and expand its footprint in foreign exchange and fixed income, comes less than a year after Blackstone (N:BX) bought a majority stake in Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI), which valued it at $20 billion.
LSE's shares were 15% higher at 6,520 pence at 1110 GMT on Monday after hitting a record high of 6,562 pence, taking them to the top of London's bluechip index (FTSE).
Thomson Reuters, the parent company of Reuters, holds a 45% stake in Refinitiv. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that if the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced this week.
LSE shareholder Royal London Asset Management (RLAM) said it was right the exchange expanded further into data, but that it wanted more information about Refinitiv's business lines. 
""We are eager to hear more from management as to their quality and ability to integrate them,"" Mike Fox, head of sustainable investments at RLAM, holds 0.98% of LSE, said in an email.
Refinitiv's bonds, issued when Blackstone bought Thomson Reuters' Financial and Risk business to form Refinitiv, rallied across the curve on Monday. 
For example, a senior unsecured US dollar November 2026 bond <31740LAC7=> rose 5 cents on the dollar to 109.5, sending the yield – which moves inversely to price – to 5.4791% from 7% at the end of last week.
Refinitiv had $12.2 billion in debt as of the end of December as a result of its leveraged buyout by Blackstone, which LSE would assume under the proposed deal.
(GRAPHIC - Exchanges Race To Grow: https://tmsnrt.rs/2yiGjex)
A merger with Refinitiv would significantly expand LSE's information services business, which the bourse operator has been building as a more stable source of cash flow than its primary transaction-reliant businesses.
JP Morgan analysts said the deal would be strategically sensible, and in line with the LSE's strategy to focus on deals that extend into growth areas such as data and analytics and to complement existing businesses. 
LSE tried to merge with rival Deutsche Boerse AG (DE:DB1Gn) in 2017, their fifth attempt to combine, but the deal collapsed when European regulators blocked it due to concerns about overlaps in their bond processing businesses. 
Deutsche Boerse had been in talks to buy Refinitiv's FX trading platform FXAll but said on Saturday that the deal was unlikely to complete.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is planning a foray into the burgeoning online food delivery business in India this year, two sources aware of the development said, in a move that could raise competition in an increasingly crowded market.
The Seattle-based company is working with local partner Catamaran, founded by IT industrialist Narayana Murthy, and has begun hiring staff for the new operation, the sources said, declining to be named because the plans had yet to be made public.
Amazon is aiming to launch the new service delivering from restaurants ahead of India's month-long festive season, which starts in September, one of the sources said.
India's rising middle class has driven the growth of the online food delivery sector, with research firm RedSeer Consulting saying https://redseer.com/newsletters/food-tech-market-updates-june18 order numbers rose 176% in 2018.
Profitability, however, remains elusive. The industry is dominated by local start-ups Swiggy, backed by Naspers and Tencent, and Zomato, which counts Sequoia as an investor.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) launched its India food delivery service in 2017 but has been unable to keep pace with the local market leaders.
Indian daily newspaper Business Standard on Monday reported that Amazon was in talks to buy Uber Eats. Reuters could not verify the news independently .
Catamaran did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Amazon and Uber said they don't comment on rumors.
Uber rival Ola also launched a food delivery service and bought Foodpanda in 2017. That company is now moving away from marketplace deliveries and focusing on its own brand of kitchens.
Amazon last month closed its food delivery operations in the United States in the face of stiff competition.
In India, the company's move into delivery from restaurants and takeaway food outlets will help Amazon to attract customers for its other services , one of the sources said.
The company launched its Prime services in India in 2016 and already offers services such as video and music streaming as well as groceries delivery in many cities across the country.
Amazon has been pitched in a battle for Indian market share against Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Flipkart, with both companies announcing various plans to attract more customers in what is viewed as one of their most important growth markets."
1337,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>","CannTrust CEO Loses Job, $6 Million in Options: Cannabis Weekly","(Bloomberg) -- Peter Aceto didn’t just lose his job as head of CannTrust Holdings Inc.: he likely lost out on about C$8.2 million ($6.2 million) in stock options, among the highest pay packages in the pot sector.
CannTrust fired Aceto, and chairman Eric Paul was asked to resign Thursday after a Globe and Mail report cited internal emails showing the executives were aware that pot was being grown in unlicensed rooms about seven months before Health Canada unearthed the breach.
Aceto’s stock options will likely be canceled, as typically happens when an executive is fired with cause. Even if they’re not canceled, the options remain well under water following the recent stock plunge related to the licensing scandal.
According to the options awarded to Aceto when he joined the company in October, a third were to be vested annually in one-third increments, with two-thirds to be vested based on achieving share price milestones of C$15 to C$25 over three years. CannTrust traded at about C$3 on Friday, well short of Aceto’s strike price of C$11.88 for his 1 million options.
Aceto’s pay package trailed Brendan Kennedy among major pot company executives. The Tilray Inc. CEO was awarded total compensation of $256 million in 2018, ranking him second to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s Elon Musk at $513 million, among pay tracked by Bloomberg. By comparison, former Canopy Growth Ltd. CEO Bruce Linton was awarded C$2.5 million and Michael Gorenstein at Cronos Group Inc. was granted C$824,842. Terry Booth at Aurora Cannabis Inc. was awarded C$1.6 million, according to company filings.
Extractors Rally
Cannabis extractors have posted outsized share gains this year, and analysts remain bullish on the sub-sector.
Key players include MediPharm Labs Corp., Valens Groworks Corp., and Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc. All three have seen their stock more than double since the start of 2019.
“Extraction will be in high demand as additional cultivation comes online, with Valens poised to be a leading player,” Eight Capital analyst Jenny Wang told clients in a note. The investment bank initiated stock coverage with a buy recommendation and price target of C$8.25.
Retail’s ‘Magic Number’
One Wall Street bank attempted to estimate how many pot dispensaries may be needed across North America to garner optimal legal sales. The magic number: about three dispensaries per 100,000 people, Seaport Global Securities LLC said in a note. The New York-based investment bank reviewed dispensary counts by state and province across North America, along with data available on industry sales receipts.
In Canada, it’s no secret the nation’s store roll-out has been slower than expected in the two most populated provinces of Ontario and Quebec. “Based upon our rule of three, we would argue that Ontario needs a total footprint of 403 stores,” up from the current figure of about 23. Additionally, Seaport estimated Quebec needs a total footprint of 245 stores, up from about 16, analyst Brett Hundley wrote. In all, Canada may need around 1,055 pot stores for the industry to see its true potential, Seaport added.
Equity Offering Litmus Test
Flowr Corp. may have given investors an indication of appetite for equity offerings. The pot producer announced a C$43.5 million bought-deal financing last week, shortly after withdrawing an equity offering the prior week. Shares surged 21% after the pulled offering, though fell 17% after the bought-deal July 22. Toronto-based GMP Securities LP is lead underwriter for the sale, which is expected to close Aug. 8. The original share offering included  Barclays  (LON:BARC), BMO Capital Markets and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Deals
Two deals catching eyes last week included Auxly Cannabis Group Inc. getting an investment from U.K. cigarette maker Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) Plc as the companies move to position themselves for the expansion of cannabis-based vaping products in Canada.
The deal is a “major positive for Auxly’s shareholders,” AltaCorp Capital analyst David Kideckel said in a note to clients. Auxly is now “one of two cannabis companies to have signed a major deal with a global tobacco company, the other one being Cronos,” he added.
Additionally, convenience-store giant Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., the owner of Circle K stores, announced an investment in pot retailer Fire & Flower Holdings Corp. It’s a “vote of confidence from a large multi-national retailer in Fire & Flower’s ability to rapidly scale its retail platform,” Eight Capital told clients in a note.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Heineken  NV (AS:HEIN) on Monday missed estimates for first-half profits, as higher packaging costs offset increased beer sales, but the world's second-largest brewer stuck with its full-year profit growth forecast.
The Dutch maker of Heineken, Europe's top-selling lager, said operating profit before one-offs would rise by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2019 after a slim 0.3% increase in the Jan-June period.
The company said it would benefit this year from increased sales, higher prices and a consumer shift to more expensive beers. But the company also warned input and logistics costs would rise by a mid-single-digit percentage over the year.
Heineken shares, which hit a record high of 104 euros on Friday, were down 6.1% at 96.82 euros at 0720 GMT, making them the weakest performers in the FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) of leading European stocks. They are still up by a quarter this year.
Heineken's input costs in the January to June period rose 8.5%, principally for aluminum used in packaging.
Chief Financial Officer Laurence Debroux told Reuters in a telephone interview that the company's hedges on aluminum had been less favorable than last year's.
Heineken's emerging market operations had also been hit by having to pay hard currency for raw and packaging material with, for example, a weaker Brazilian real.
Costs also increased because of e-commerce investment and an IT upgrade and some sponsorship costs more skewed to the first half of the year.
""If you look at the first half, the month of June was more difficult, mainly because of weather in a number of countries, but the underlying trend of the business is on track ... and we're expecting that to move into the second half,"" Debroux said.
For the first half, beer sales volumes rose in all regions, except Europe, where it was hit by poor weather and an unfavorable comparison to last year when the soccer World Cup boosted sales.
Operating profit grew by 0.3% on a like-for-like basis to 1.78 billion euros ($1.98 billion) in the first half, missing analysts' estimate of 1.92 billion euros, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Sales were particularly strong in Vietnam, Heineken's second most profitable market, rising by a double-digit percentage as it pushes deeper into the country.
Sales in Mexico, the company's largest market, were up by a low single-digit percentage, and by a high single-digit percentage in Brazil, where Heineken is the second largest brewer.
""We knew the first half was going to be weaker than the second, but clearly the market hadn't realized the scale of the pressures in the first,"" said Trevor Stirling, beverage analyst at Bernstein Securities. ""The business itself is in pretty good shape.""
The fall in Heineken's shares puts it behind Danish rival Carlsberg (CO:CARLb), which is up by almost a third this year, and the world's top brewer  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), which has rebounded by more than 50% partly due to easing concerns over its debt.

Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the newspaper said the idea of a group holding structure was under early discussion both at management level and in parts of the supervisory board.
Responding to the report, Lufthansa said that it reviewed its group structure at regular intervals. A spokesman declined to elaborate further when contacted by Reuters.
CEO Carsten Spohr has come under mounting pressure after an acquisitive spell exposed Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) to a broader industry downturn that has in particular inflicted losses on its Eurowings budget operation.
Lufthansa shares have fallen 30% over the past year, leaving the airline with a stock market worth of $8 billion euros - less than half the value at which its carries it aircraft fleet on its books, Handelsblatt noted.
Backers of the idea of a holding structure look to the example of IAG (L:ICAG), which runs British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus as separate profit centers.
Spohr has set up a working group to examine Lufthansa's matrix management structure, which is seen as causing inefficiencies and higher administrative costs, Handelsblatt reported, adding that its work was seen as preparing the group for an eventual transition to a holding structure."

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2019 08:31PM ET</span>","As rural India develops taste for chocolate, a dominant Mondelez extends its reach","By Richa Naidu and Siddharth Cavale
CHICAGO/HAROHALLI, India (Reuters) - Two years ago, Satish P., a bakery owner in the small village of Harohalli near Bengaluru, had his doubts about stocking Mondelez's (O:MDLZ) Cadbury Silk bars.
Priced between 70 and 170 rupees, they seemed out of reach for customers used to paying only 5 rupees for the tiny chocolates he has sold for years. But he took a chance and now rings up to 3,500 rupees ($50) in Silk bar sales a month.
""Villagers can afford premium chocolates now,"" he said.
As Satish and other Harohalli shopkeepers have found chocolate sales in India are taking off, helped by growth in disposable incomes that extends to the country's 650,000 poorer villages where more than two-thirds of the population reside.
A boom in e-commerce and a sharp tax cut are also propelling sales higher, spurring global confectioners like  Mondelez International Inc , Nestle SA (S:NESN) and relative newcomer  Hershey Co  (N:HSY) to invest further in the still small but rapidly expanding market.
Illinois-based Mondelez, India's No.1 chocolate maker, told Reuters ""the big bulk"" of a $150 million increase in global investment this year - the first hike in five years - will be in rural India.
The company, which first started providing Indian store owners with free display coolers in early 2000s, ramped up their distribution to rural areas over the last year. It now plans to be in about 75,000-100,000 villages in the next three years, up from 50,000 in 2018.
To that end, it is also expanding its fleet of refrigerated trucks and building a database that maps India's small neighborhood stores and monitors sales of its products at those shops.
""There's a misconception that rural consumers are poor. Not all of them are. There are rich farmers, who are coming into the consuming class,"" Deepak Iyer, Mondelez's managing director for India told Reuters.
Iyer said Mondelez was targeting villages with as few as 3,000 people. ""There are families aspiring for premium products because they see them through mobile connectivity today.""
NEW PRODUCTS, MORE MARKETING 
Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put said competitors will find it hard to match the firm's scale in the country.
Cadbury's vast, decades-old distribution network in India was a key attraction for Kraft Food in its $19.6 billion takeover of the brand in 2010. Kraft later split into two firms with its global snacks business renamed Mondelez.
""It's not going to be easy (for rivals) to carve out space, to be really be noticed in the store,"" he said an interview, adding that Mondelez has consistently grown market share in India for several years.
Mondelez says it now commands 66% of the Indian chocolate market. Cadbury, a 195-year old British confectionery brand, entered India in 1948 and its Dairy Milk, Silk and 5Star products have since made it a household name. The Dairy Milk brand alone accounts for 40% of the market.
Nestle is ranked No.2, followed by Ferrero and Hershey, according to Euromonitor. The companies have not disclosed market share estimates.
At $1.9 billion in annual sales, India has plenty of room to grow. China, also a developing economy with a similar population size, is a $3.2 billion market but both pale in comparison to the U.S. market of $19.2 billion, Euromonitor data shows.
Last year, chocolate sales in India jumped 15.4% after the government, keen to win re-election, overhauled its national sales tax for many items. The cut in tax to 18% from 28% reduced chocolate retail prices and companies nearly tripled the amount they spent on promotions, according to market research firm Nielsen.

Mondelez says its Cadbury brand, which has worked for decades with WPP's (L:WPP) Ogilvy India on Bollywood star-studded TV ads, is spending more on marketing. And to tap online demand, the company has created a Cadbury-only store on Amazon.com (O:AMZN) that personalizes gift boxes for India's year-round festivals.
It is also introducing new products. Last month, it launched a low-sugar Dairy Milk bar, addressing a growing market for healthier products in India where 9% of adults have diabetes.
KISSES IMPACT
Nestle, the world's biggest packaged foods company, has also been investing in counter-top coolers, expanding distribution, running celebrity ads and launching premium products. Last year, it began importing its ""hand-crafted artisanal"" Les Recettes De L’Atelier bars from Europe.
Hershey is doing its best to catch up.
It entered India's chocolate market in 2016 with its lesser known Brookside brand and announced plans the next year to spend $50 million in five years.
Rapid growth has come with the introduction of its 112-year-old Kisses brand last autumn, helping it replace Mars as India's No. 4 chocolate company, although its products are only available in 14 cities and major online stores like Amazon.com, BigBasket.com and Flipkart.com.
""We're at an early stage...we will extend this by going national and subsequently we'll look at going down from urban to rural,"" Herjit Bhalla, Hershey India's managing director, told Reuters. 
The unit had spent more than expected over the past year, funding celebrity ad campaigns and technology including hand-held devices that analyze store preferences, Bhalla said.

India's e-commerce market is a priority, he added, with online orders accounting for over 4% of sales, higher than the 1% seen for India's overall consumer goods market.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2019 04:39PM ET</span>",Exclusive: BlackRock in talks to take over Cofense after U.S. security concerns - sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), an investor in Cofense Inc, is in advanced talks to take over the U.S. cyber security firm, after a U.S. national security panel asked buyout firm Pamplona Capital Management LLP to sell its stake, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security concerns, has not disclosed why it asked Pamplona to sell its 47% stake in Leesburg, Virginia-based Cofense, which helps protect email users from phishing attacks.
The development represents one of the rare, high-profile examples of CFIUS undoing a deal that had already been completed. 
A major investor in Pamplona's private equity funds is Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman, who was included in an ""oligarchs' watchlist"" by the U.S. Treasury Department that could have resulted in sanctions against him because of his potential ties to the Kremlin. 
However, unlike other Russian oligarchs such as Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg, Fridman has not been hit by U.S. sanctions. 
""The process remains ongoing and we are working diligently towards a solution,"" Pamplona said in a statement, declining to comment further.
Representatives for BlackRock, Cofense, Fridman and the U.S. Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Pamplona decided last October to launch an auction process to sell its stake after CFIUS approached it. Pamplona took the decision 10 months after acquiring Cofense with BlackRock, and other investors, including Adam Street Partners and Telstra Ventures, in a $400 million deal.
BlackRock, which owns a 30% stake in Cofense, is the front-runner to buy Pamplona's stake in a deal that could be reached as early as this week, the sources said. However, it is still possible that another bidder prevails or that negotiations will fall through, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. 
A July 19 deadline agreed with CFIUS to reach a deal for Cofense has already lapsed. Complicating negotiations is the involvement of the U.S. government, which has formed a trustee with the company to oversee the sale, the sources said.
The protracted process is also weighing on price negotiations. Pamplona is negotiating with BlackRock a mechanism of deferred payments that will be based on the future financial performance of Cofense, which it hopes will eventually lead to a deal value higher than last year's investment, the sources said.
It is also possible, however, that the deal ends up valuing Cofense, which was previously known as Phishme, lower than last year's $400 million valuation, the sources added.
Pamplona and BlackRock did not seek CFIUS approval when they completed their deal for Cofense last year, because the review system is voluntary and the firms thought there would be no national security concerns raised, according to the sources.
The firms relied on Cofense's management team, which also has an equity stake in the company, to run the business, the sources added.
CFIUS has made cyber security and the protection of personal data its top priority in recent months. The U.S. intelligence community's 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment report cited Russia's efforts to interfere in the U.S. political system.
In another example this year of CFIUS seeking to untangle an acquisition, it asked Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd earlier to sell Grindr LLC, the popular gay dating app it has owned since 2016. Grindr collects personal information submitted by its users, including a person's location, messages, and in some cases even someone’s HIV status.
Last year, CFIUS launched a pilot program under which filings for review for certain types of investments in some U.S. technology companies it deems to be of critical importance are no longer optional.
ALFA GROUP TIES
Fridman and his partners control Alfa Group, which includes top Russian private bank Alfa Bank, its biggest food retailer X5 Retail Group and other assets.
Fridman, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $15.9 billion, is also a principal shareholder in LetterOne, which invests in energy, telecoms, technology and other areas.
Pamplona was founded in 2005 in London by Moscow-born British dealmaker Alexander Knaster, who had previously served as CEO of Alfa Bank from 1998 until 2004. Last year, Knaster passed on day-to-day management of Pamplona to co-managing partners Martin Schwab and William Pruellage. 
Knaster remains chairman of Pamplona, which manages over $12 billion in assets across a number of funds.
BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is best known as a provider of mutual funds, but has also invested in private equity since 1999. This year it has raised $2.75 billion for a long-term private capital fund that has a provisional fundraising target of $10 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. buyout fund Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) is expected to announce the merger of its majority-owned financial data firm Refinitiv with the  London Stock Exchange  Group Plc (L:LSE) within a week, but the deal is expected to face a long antitrust review before it can close, four sources told Reuters.
Negotiations on the $27 billion deal are at an advanced stage, with Blackstone, the LSE and  Thomson Reuters Corp  (TO:TRI) in broad agreement on the main aspects of the deal, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A formal announcement could come on Aug. 1 when the LSE publishes half-year results, two of the sources said.
Thomson Reuters spokesman David Crundwell declined to comment. Representatives at Refinitiv, Blackstone and the LSE also declined to comment.
A merger would significantly expand the LSE's information services business, which the bourse operator has been building as a more stable source of cash flow than its trading and clearing businesses, putting pressure on competitors including Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE) and Deutsche Boerse AG (DE:DB1Gn).
A deal could however face some risks. 
Antitrust regulators in Europe and the United States are expected to start an in-depth review which may last up to 18 months, the sources said.
In the European Union, the deal is expected to go into a Phase II investigation, two sources said, a more onerous review used only in deals where there are concerns it will have a major impact on competition. 
The EU is expected to scrutinize if the deal will affect the price of financial data, one source said.
Investor groups in Europe have been lobbying for stock exchanges to cut the price of stock transactions data so that a ""consolidated"" feed of prices from different platforms can be created at a reasonable cost.
SHARE LOCK-UPS
Blackstone and other Refinitiv investors will also face several share lock-up periods, with the first expected to last through 2022, depending on the length of the antitrust review.
Three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the private equity fund intends to press ahead with the deal having carefully weighed regulatory hurdles and the risk that LSE shares could fall sharply if Britain leaves the EU without a deal in October.
They said the deal has strategic merits and would not be a ""quick flip"" as the U.S. fund will keep investing in the combined entity for at least another three to four years.
""This is like a reverse buy-and-build strategy,"" one source said, adding a merger with the LSE had been contemplated since the Refinitiv deal closed in October.
If successful, Blackstone will have roughly doubled the value of its original investment in Refinitiv in nine months.
It will then be able to gradually reduce its LSE exposure by selling shares as lock-up periods expire, the sources said.
One source said the deal has been discussed by the Thomson Reuters board, which was in favor of the transaction.
The company said on July 26 that a 30-year agreement for Refinitiv to license content from Reuters News, signed when Blackstone invested, would remain in place under the terms of the new deal.
BOARD SEATS
The LSE has said it would pay for the deal with newly issued shares, turning Refinitiv's existing investors into LSE shareholders who would own about 37% of the combined company.
Blackstone bought a majority stake in Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters last year in a deal valuing the company at $20 billion, including debt.
Blackstone agreed last year to grant Thomson Reuters warrants that would increase its 45% stake in Refinitiv to 47.6% if some performance metrics were met, three of the sources said.
Those milestones have now been achieved by Refinitiv, according to the sources. This means Thomson Reuters will secure a 15% LSE stake, while Blackstone and other minority investors, including Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singapore state fund GIC - which helped finance the Refinitiv buyout - will control 22%.
Refinitiv management will also get some LSE shares, the sources said.
Blackstone and Thomson Reuters are expected to have seats on the LSE board as part of a deal, though their combined voting rights will be capped at 30%.
Blackstone will have two board seats while Thomson Reuters will have one, the sources said.
Refinitiv boss David Craig will continue leading the financial data firm as an independent brand within LSE, the sources said.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Robey Warshaw are working with the LSE, the sources said.

Blackstone has hired Evercore Inc (N:EVR) and Canson Capital Partners to negotiate on its behalf, while Thomson Reuters is represented by Guggenheim Securities, they added.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  London Stock Exchange  Group Plc's (L:LSE) planned purchase of Refinitiv in a $27 billion deal is the latest sign that exchange operators are focusing more on data products to increase revenue, while also trying to expand their global reach.
For more than a decade, exchange operators around the globe have been trying to consolidate. But proposed tie-ups between major competitors have failed several times in the past because of resistance from government authorities who either had antitrust concerns or did not want a foreign company running what was often seen as a national symbol.
At the same time, profits from the traditional business of facilitating transactions like stock trades have fallen, pushing the industry to look for related businesses for growth, analysts and industry sources said. 
Because revenue from data products has been rising and is expected to continue doing so, exchanges are now hungry for these products as well as selling services based off that data and information, such as indexes and fee-based services they can offer once a trade has cleared.
""Data is the lifeblood of financial markets today now more than ever - and that data is getting more and more valuable,"" said Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and technology research at Greenwich Associates.
If completed, LSE's deal to buy Refinitiv, a global financial data analytics provider, from buyout firm Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) and  Thomson Reuters Corp  (TO:TRI) will fit that mold, the analysts said.
""It just makes them more competitive and more appealing as a partner for customers because it brings together a lot more than what LSE had before,"" said Spencer Mindlin, an Aite Group analyst who focuses on capital markets trading technology.
LSE and Thomson Reuters declined to comment for this article, referring to their earlier statements that confirmed they were in discussions for a deal. Blackstone did not have an immediate comment.
In its statement, LSE said a deal would help expand its data and distribution capabilities, diversify trading capabilities and increase global footprint, allowing it to benefit from ""future data- and technology-enabled growth opportunities.""
LSE said it expects to cut more than 350 million pounds in annual costs for five years after the deal closes, and add to its earnings per share in the first full year after completion.
GLOBAL EXPANSION 
Refinitiv is based in London and reaches more than 40,000 clients, who are largely traders and investment professionals, in more than 190 countries.
Patrick Young, an industry consultant at Exchange Invest, said LSE's deal for Refinitiv would be ""a major pivot away from the EU"" for the exchange operator.
Just last month, London Stock Exchange Chief Executive David Schwimmer said it was difficult even to consider big mergers because of political opposition. 
The company failed several times to merge with Germany's Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) AG (GDAXI) and previously failed to acquire Canada's main exchange, TSX Inc.
Those collapsed deals mirror proposed cross-border marriages that didn't work, including Singapore Exchange Ltd's (SI:SGXL) attempt to buy Australia's ASX Ltd (AX:ASX) in 2011.
QUEST TO DIVERSIFY
Major exchanges, including Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) and Deutsche Boerse, have been more successful in inking smaller deals that diversify their businesses away from basic stock trading.
The most basic services that exchanges provide are real-time market data feeds. In the United States, that generates about $1.4 billion in annual revenue for the industry, according to Greenwich Associates. Exchanges generate billions more in data revenue beyond that for related products and services.
Investors and banks that pay for the information have been pushing back on pricing. Some investment firms have called on the European Union's markets watchdog ESMA to review market data fees, saying they keep on rising despite falling costs of computing and data storage. 
At London Stock Exchange, former chief executive Xavier Rolet began to diversify revenue after taking the helm in 2009.
Today, information services account for nearly 40% of the group's 2.14 billion pounds ($2.65 billion) in annual revenues, according to its 2018 annual report. That portion is followed by post-trade services at just over one-third.
Traditional capital markets business like stock trading and initial public offerings accounted for just 19% of revenue last year, compared with around 46% a decade ago.

The sale is one of the first privatizations the kingdom is planning as part of a wide-reaching overhaul of its economy.
It has attracted interest from some of the world's largest agribusiness firms, including Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM) and  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG).
Still, Saudi Grains Organization (SAGO) in its statement on Sunday did not name successful pre-qualified bidders from the first phase of the process last year.
Privatization of the flour milling sector is seen as a litmus test for other large state asset sales to follow.
Large grain market players' interest in SAGO's mills comes as Saudi Arabia grows increasingly dependent on grain imports. The kingdom has become a major importer of wheat and barley since abandoning plans in 2008 to become self-sufficient - as farming in the desert was draining scarce water supplies.
But grain industry sources have said the lengthy privatization process has since discouraged some potential bidders."
1358,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2019 04:19AM ET</span>",Exclusive: UAE's Dana Gas hires adviser to sell Egypt assets,"By Clara Denina and Davide Barbuscia
LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates' Dana Gas has hired investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. (TPH) to advise it on the sale of its Egyptian assets, worth over $500 million, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the company shifts its focus to its Kurdistan operations.
The Abu Dhabi-listed energy producer - whose main assets are in Egypt and in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) - has been considering an alternative listing in London, and focusing on a single geographical area could be appealing to future investors in the company, said one of the sources. The sources did not wish to be identified because the information has not been made public.
A spokesman for Dana Gas declined to comment while TPH did not immediately respond to a request for comment, sent outside working hours.
Dana's exploration and production assets in Egypt are onshore the Nile Delta except for Block 6 in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.
In May Dana began drilling at the offshore Merak well in Block 6, saying it could hold up to 4 trillion cubic feet of gas.
On Sunday Dana said in a bourse filing that the drilling has not found commercial hydrocarbons and that the well is being abandoned. It added its operations in Egypt continue production normally.
The gas producer started marketing its Egyptian assets over the past few weeks and while it has received interest from the market there are no buyers lined up yet, said the first source, who added the assets are worth ""well over $500 million.""
The decision to sell in Egypt is ""strategic"" as Dana wants to focus its resources on investments in KRI, where it has large capital expenditure requirements and sees potential for growth, the source added.
In a second bourse filing on Sunday, Dana said a new independently audited report showed the fields in which it has stakes in KRI could be ""the biggest gas fields in the whole of Iraq"". 
Pearl Petroleum, a consortium majority-owned by Dana Gas and its affiliate Crescent Petroleum, plans to increase gas production from the KRI's Khor Mor field to 650 mmscf per day by 2022 and 900 mmscf per day by 2023, Dana said.
The expansion plan, worth some $700 million, will include adding two new production trains as well as drilling new wells to raise output from the current 400 mmscf a day, Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum said in March, when they announced a 20-year gas sales deal with the Kurdistan Regional Government.
In May, Dana's Chief Executive said Pearl Petroleum would raise funding for the KRI investments through several types of financing. 
Dana's 2019 capital expenditure for Iraqi Kurdistan was estimated at $70 million-$90 million, while its capex for Egypt this year would have been about $90 million, he said at the time.
Dana Gas, which at the end of this year's first quarter had a cash balance of $442 million, rocked the world of Islamic finance in 2017, when it halted payments on $700 million in sukuk saying the instruments had become unlawful in the UAE. 
After a protracted and complex legal dispute it reached a consensual restructuring agreement with its creditors in May last year.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2019 04:39PM ET</span>",Exclusive: BlackRock in talks to take over Cofense after U.S. security concerns - sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), an investor in Cofense Inc, is in advanced talks to take over the U.S. cyber security firm, after a U.S. national security panel asked buyout firm Pamplona Capital Management LLP to sell its stake, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security concerns, has not disclosed why it asked Pamplona to sell its 47% stake in Leesburg, Virginia-based Cofense, which helps protect email users from phishing attacks.
The development represents one of the rare, high-profile examples of CFIUS undoing a deal that had already been completed. 
A major investor in Pamplona's private equity funds is Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman, who was included in an ""oligarchs' watchlist"" by the U.S. Treasury Department that could have resulted in sanctions against him because of his potential ties to the Kremlin. 
However, unlike other Russian oligarchs such as Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg, Fridman has not been hit by U.S. sanctions. 
""The process remains ongoing and we are working diligently towards a solution,"" Pamplona said in a statement, declining to comment further.
Representatives for BlackRock, Cofense, Fridman and the U.S. Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Pamplona decided last October to launch an auction process to sell its stake after CFIUS approached it. Pamplona took the decision 10 months after acquiring Cofense with BlackRock, and other investors, including Adam Street Partners and Telstra Ventures, in a $400 million deal.
BlackRock, which owns a 30% stake in Cofense, is the front-runner to buy Pamplona's stake in a deal that could be reached as early as this week, the sources said. However, it is still possible that another bidder prevails or that negotiations will fall through, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. 
A July 19 deadline agreed with CFIUS to reach a deal for Cofense has already lapsed. Complicating negotiations is the involvement of the U.S. government, which has formed a trustee with the company to oversee the sale, the sources said.
The protracted process is also weighing on price negotiations. Pamplona is negotiating with BlackRock a mechanism of deferred payments that will be based on the future financial performance of Cofense, which it hopes will eventually lead to a deal value higher than last year's investment, the sources said.
It is also possible, however, that the deal ends up valuing Cofense, which was previously known as Phishme, lower than last year's $400 million valuation, the sources added.
Pamplona and BlackRock did not seek CFIUS approval when they completed their deal for Cofense last year, because the review system is voluntary and the firms thought there would be no national security concerns raised, according to the sources.
The firms relied on Cofense's management team, which also has an equity stake in the company, to run the business, the sources added.
CFIUS has made cyber security and the protection of personal data its top priority in recent months. The U.S. intelligence community's 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment report cited Russia's efforts to interfere in the U.S. political system.
In another example this year of CFIUS seeking to untangle an acquisition, it asked Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd earlier to sell Grindr LLC, the popular gay dating app it has owned since 2016. Grindr collects personal information submitted by its users, including a person's location, messages, and in some cases even someone’s HIV status.
Last year, CFIUS launched a pilot program under which filings for review for certain types of investments in some U.S. technology companies it deems to be of critical importance are no longer optional.
ALFA GROUP TIES
Fridman and his partners control Alfa Group, which includes top Russian private bank Alfa Bank, its biggest food retailer X5 Retail Group and other assets.
Fridman, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $15.9 billion, is also a principal shareholder in LetterOne, which invests in energy, telecoms, technology and other areas.
Pamplona was founded in 2005 in London by Moscow-born British dealmaker Alexander Knaster, who had previously served as CEO of Alfa Bank from 1998 until 2004. Last year, Knaster passed on day-to-day management of Pamplona to co-managing partners Martin Schwab and William Pruellage. 
Knaster remains chairman of Pamplona, which manages over $12 billion in assets across a number of funds.
BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is best known as a provider of mutual funds, but has also invested in private equity since 1999. This year it has raised $2.75 billion for a long-term private capital fund that has a provisional fundraising target of $10 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. buyout fund Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) is expected to announce the merger of its majority-owned financial data firm Refinitiv with the  London Stock Exchange  Group Plc (L:LSE) within a week, but the deal is expected to face a long antitrust review before it can close, four sources told Reuters.
Negotiations on the $27 billion deal are at an advanced stage, with Blackstone, the LSE and  Thomson Reuters Corp  (TO:TRI) in broad agreement on the main aspects of the deal, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A formal announcement could come on Aug. 1 when the LSE publishes half-year results, two of the sources said.
Thomson Reuters spokesman David Crundwell declined to comment. Representatives at Refinitiv, Blackstone and the LSE also declined to comment.
A merger would significantly expand the LSE's information services business, which the bourse operator has been building as a more stable source of cash flow than its trading and clearing businesses, putting pressure on competitors including Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE) and Deutsche Boerse AG (DE:DB1Gn).
A deal could however face some risks. 
Antitrust regulators in Europe and the United States are expected to start an in-depth review which may last up to 18 months, the sources said.

If completed, LSE's deal to buy Refinitiv, a global financial data analytics provider, from buyout firm Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) and  Thomson Reuters Corp  (TO:TRI) will fit that mold, the analysts said.
""It just makes them more competitive and more appealing as a partner for customers because it brings together a lot more than what LSE had before,"" said Spencer Mindlin, an Aite Group analyst who focuses on capital markets trading technology.
LSE and Thomson Reuters declined to comment for this article, referring to their earlier statements that confirmed they were in discussions for a deal. Blackstone did not have an immediate comment.
In its statement, LSE said a deal would help expand its data and distribution capabilities, diversify trading capabilities and increase global footprint, allowing it to benefit from ""future data- and technology-enabled growth opportunities.""
LSE said it expects to cut more than 350 million pounds in annual costs for five years after the deal closes, and add to its earnings per share in the first full year after completion.
GLOBAL EXPANSION 
Refinitiv is based in London and reaches more than 40,000 clients, who are largely traders and investment professionals, in more than 190 countries.
Patrick Young, an industry consultant at Exchange Invest, said LSE's deal for Refinitiv would be ""a major pivot away from the EU"" for the exchange operator.
Just last month, London Stock Exchange Chief Executive David Schwimmer said it was difficult even to consider big mergers because of political opposition. 
The company failed several times to merge with Germany's Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) AG (GDAXI) and previously failed to acquire Canada's main exchange, TSX Inc.
Those collapsed deals mirror proposed cross-border marriages that didn't work, including Singapore Exchange Ltd's (SI:SGXL) attempt to buy Australia's ASX Ltd (AX:ASX) in 2011.
QUEST TO DIVERSIFY
Major exchanges, including Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) and Deutsche Boerse, have been more successful in inking smaller deals that diversify their businesses away from basic stock trading.
The most basic services that exchanges provide are real-time market data feeds. In the United States, that generates about $1.4 billion in annual revenue for the industry, according to Greenwich Associates. Exchanges generate billions more in data revenue beyond that for related products and services.
Investors and banks that pay for the information have been pushing back on pricing. Some investment firms have called on the European Union's markets watchdog ESMA to review market data fees, saying they keep on rising despite falling costs of computing and data storage. 
At London Stock Exchange, former chief executive Xavier Rolet began to diversify revenue after taking the helm in 2009.
Today, information services account for nearly 40% of the group's 2.14 billion pounds ($2.65 billion) in annual revenues, according to its 2018 annual report. That portion is followed by post-trade services at just over one-third.
Traditional capital markets business like stock trading and initial public offerings accounted for just 19% of revenue last year, compared with around 46% a decade ago.

The sale is one of the first privatizations the kingdom is planning as part of a wide-reaching overhaul of its economy.
It has attracted interest from some of the world's largest agribusiness firms, including Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM) and  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG).
Still, Saudi Grains Organization (SAGO) in its statement on Sunday did not name successful pre-qualified bidders from the first phase of the process last year.
Privatization of the flour milling sector is seen as a litmus test for other large state asset sales to follow.
Large grain market players' interest in SAGO's mills comes as Saudi Arabia grows increasingly dependent on grain imports. The kingdom has become a major importer of wheat and barley since abandoning plans in 2008 to become self-sufficient - as farming in the desert was draining scarce water supplies.
But grain industry sources have said the lengthy privatization process has since discouraged some potential bidders."

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates' Dana Gas has hired investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. (TPH) to advise it on the sale of its Egyptian assets, worth over $500 million, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the company shifts its focus to its Kurdistan operations.
The Abu Dhabi-listed energy producer - whose main assets are in Egypt and in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) - has been considering an alternative listing in London, and focusing on a single geographical area could be appealing to future investors in the company, said one of the sources. The sources did not wish to be identified because the information has not been made public.
A spokesman for Dana Gas declined to comment while TPH did not immediately respond to a request for comment, sent outside working hours.
Dana's exploration and production assets in Egypt are onshore the Nile Delta except for Block 6 in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.
In May Dana began drilling at the offshore Merak well in Block 6, saying it could hold up to 4 trillion cubic feet of gas.
On Sunday Dana said in a bourse filing that the drilling has not found commercial hydrocarbons and that the well is being abandoned. It added its operations in Egypt continue production normally.
The gas producer started marketing its Egyptian assets over the past few weeks and while it has received interest from the market there are no buyers lined up yet, said the first source, who added the assets are worth ""well over $500 million.""
The decision to sell in Egypt is ""strategic"" as Dana wants to focus its resources on investments in KRI, where it has large capital expenditure requirements and sees potential for growth, the source added.
In a second bourse filing on Sunday, Dana said a new independently audited report showed the fields in which it has stakes in KRI could be ""the biggest gas fields in the whole of Iraq"". 
Pearl Petroleum, a consortium majority-owned by Dana Gas and its affiliate Crescent Petroleum, plans to increase gas production from the KRI's Khor Mor field to 650 mmscf per day by 2022 and 900 mmscf per day by 2023, Dana said.
The expansion plan, worth some $700 million, will include adding two new production trains as well as drilling new wells to raise output from the current 400 mmscf a day, Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum said in March, when they announced a 20-year gas sales deal with the Kurdistan Regional Government.
In May, Dana's Chief Executive said Pearl Petroleum would raise funding for the KRI investments through several types of financing. 
Dana's 2019 capital expenditure for Iraqi Kurdistan was estimated at $70 million-$90 million, while its capex for Egypt this year would have been about $90 million, he said at the time.
Dana Gas, which at the end of this year's first quarter had a cash balance of $442 million, rocked the world of Islamic finance in 2017, when it halted payments on $700 million in sukuk saying the instruments had become unlawful in the UAE. 
After a protracted and complex legal dispute it reached a consensual restructuring agreement with its creditors in May last year.

He told a news conference that once market conditions change, SABIC will have another round of talks about the joint venture with Clariant, which the two companies shelved.

Mylan shareholders would receive a little more than 40% of the newly formed entity, with Pfizer shareholders receiving the remainder, the person said, adding that Pfizer would also get about $12 billion in proceeds from a new sale of debt.
Separation of Pfizer's off-patent business would be a tax-free spin-off, the person added.
Last year, Pfizer said it was planning to reorganize into three units, separating its consumer healthcare business.
The restructuring will allow the company to evaluate its businesses better and could result in selling or spinning off its off-patent drugs, Wall Street analysts earlier said.

As a result Bosch would not be able to achieve an earnings before interest and taxes margin of 7% as it did last year, Stefan Asenkerschbaumer told the newspaper.
The company had forecast a rise in revenue and an EBIT margin of 6% to 7% for this year.
""We will not be able to repeat the high margin from last year given the development in revenues,"" Asenkerschbaumer said, adding that he believed automotive production would stagnate over the next three years.
By 2025, Bosch expects to generate 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in revenue from electric cars thanks to steady growth in this segment, particularly from China, he said.
Bosch has already supplied components for more than 1 million electric vehicles and expects revenues to grow since it has developed powertrains for 50 vehicle platforms for various manufacturers, the executive told the newspaper."

""No, we will not sell Sandoz,"" Narasimhan told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. ""We will make Sandoz autonomous within Novartis, so it's more competitive. Our plan is to focus Sandoz and make it better in the long-term.""
Novartis is revamping Sandoz, a process Narasimhan has previously said will take roughly the next year and a half. He has already sold a generic U.S. pills business and dermatology assets that were under extreme price pressure, and has suggested other divestitures may be forthcoming.
These changes, along with the departure of Sandoz's former CEO in March, have prompted some analysts to predict Narasimhan may eventually exit generics.
Sandoz, which last year had nearly $10 billion in sales, upgraded its full-year sales target on July 18, holding out the possibility of low-single-digit percentage sales growth, up from a previous prediction of ""broadly in line"" with 2018.
In the first half of 2018, Sandoz's business with biosimilar copies of branded blockbusters in Europe helped offset a U.S. business that remains under price pressure.
Narasimhan also said he planned to keep both Sandoz and Hexal brands in Germany. ""There will be no changes here,"" he told the newspaper."
1373,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 27, 2019 03:35AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s three things that flew under the radar this week.
1. Coke Is Goldilocks
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) enjoyed one of its best weeks in a long time, rising more than 5.5%, tops among the 30 Dow stocks.
It hit a new high on Wednesday and is up 14.6% for the year.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) enjoyed one of its best weeks in a long time, rising more than 5.5%, tops among the 30 Dow stocks.
Sure, the year-to-date return pales compared with Dow-leading Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 39% gain this year.
But Coca-Cola's return is deceiving, because it includes the drubbing the beverage giant suffered in mid-February after its fourth-quarter earnings report disappointed Wall Street and knocked the shares down about 10%, before bottoming on Feb. 19.
Since then, Coca-Cola is up 21%.
So, what happened? Original Coke products did well. So did Coke Zero Sugar, which has been growing a double-digit levels. In the beverage business, that's a big deal.
Second-quarter revenue grew 6% to $10 billion. Earnings per share jumped 13%. The company now expects full-year organic growth (reported growth less the effects of acquisitions and currency changes) to hit 5%. In February, the company was thinking 4% growth. 
But Coke's stock price may be vulnerable because it's hit a string of new highs recently. The shares are trading at 33x trailing earnings, a rich premium. Its relative strength index has topped 70 - a key technical level to judge overvaluation - several times in the last week.
But the dividend investor should like Coke. Its $1.20-a-share payout is stable and represents a yield of about 3%.
And Coke is a value play, never too hot and not too cold. The stock fell slightly in last year's fourth quarter, while the market overall was pummeled.
2. More Pain Ahead for European Banks?
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled a stimulus package was in the pipeline for September, sending Germany’s government bond yields to a record low.
Germany’s 10 year government bond yield hit a new all-time low of 0.422% on Thursday intraday, before paring some losses.
Analysts have previously warned that every 25 basis points additional of a rate cut may prove a drag of about 2% on earnings per share of banks.
“Low rates have hurt bank profitability in most developed markets for years now, and the pain doesn’t seem to be coming to an end any time soon,” said Jan Schildbach, head of research for banking and financial markets at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) in Frankfurt.
Earnings from both UBS and Deutsche Bank this week gave traders an insight into the damage that negative rates may bring.
Deutsche warned that it expects European short-term rates will rise to just 0% (you read that right) in 2021.
""The bottom line for the banks in Europe is that low rates are a problem as they can't grow net interest income,"" said PM Capital's chief investment officer Paul Moore. ""They typically have cost inflation as they tend to be labor intensive banks and if you can't grow net interest income, it's hard to grow profits.""
The iShares STOXX Europe 600 (DE:STOXXIEX) ended the week down, adding to losses of more than 9% for the quarter.
With earnings from  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP)  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and Natixis (OTC:NTXFY) on the deck for next week, investors may have to brace for further gloom out from the region’s main banks.
3. Is Snap in a Netflix Trap?
Social media company Snap (NYSE:SNAP) reported earnings this week, with the investors applauding the results and shares jumping.
The company that runs Snapchat beat on the top and bottom lines and also on one of the key social media metrics, with daily active users rising to 203 million.
Once the black sheep of the social media crowd, derided by investors and Kylie Jenner alike, the company’s stock is now near a 52-week high.
Snap stressed that original content was not only a driver of results, but something it plans to focus on in the future.
The concentration is on Discover, an aspect of an app that is solely friend-to-friend which “is all about keeping (users) up-to-date on current events, pop culture”.
But that concentration could put Snap in the same quandary as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
The total daily time spent by Snapchat users watching Discover rose 60% from the year-ago period – clearly a big deal to the company’s growth strategy.
“We continue to invest in our Discover platform, with a particular focus on building a sustainable premium content ecosystem,” Snap said
That means a big continued investment in original content.
But just like Netflix, Snap is facing competitors with very big pockets like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 10:31PM ET</span>",London Stock Exchange in talks to buy Refinitiv for $27 billion,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Imani Moise
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The  London Stock Exchange  Group Plc (L:LSE) said on Friday it was in discussions to acquire financial data analytics provider Refinitiv Holdings Ltd for $27 billion, including debt.
The deal would come less than a year after buyout firm Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) acquired a majority stake in Refinitiv from  Thomson Reuters Corp  (TO:TRI), valuing the company at the time at $20 billion including debt.
LSE said it would pay for the deal with newly issued LSE shares as currency, turning Refinitiv's existing investors into LSE shareholders who would own about 37% of the combined company and hold less than 30% of the voting rights.
Thomson Reuters, a professional information company that is the parent of Reuters News, currently holds a 45% stake in Refinitiv. It confirmed the negotiations in a statement and said it will own a 15% stake in LSE if the deal is completed.
Based on the valuation the deal would assign to Refinitiv, Blackstone will have roughly doubled the value of its original investment in the company, according to a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity because the private equity firm keeps that number confidential.
Refinitiv had $12.2 billion in debt as of the end of December as a result of its leveraged buyout by Blackstone, which LSE would assume under the proposed deal.
LSE and Thomson Reuters both cautioned that there is no certainty that discussions between the parties will progress or that a transaction will be forthcoming. A person familiar with the matter said on Friday that if the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be agreed next week.
Refinitiv did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Blackstone declined to comment.
Refinitiv bonds rallied on the prospect of a deal.
Thomson Reuters shares hit a record high to end trading on Friday up 4.5% to C$92.74 in Toronto after the Financial Times first reported on the deal talks. The stock is up 62% since the end of January 2018, when Blackstone and Thomson Reuters announced the deal for Refinitiv.
A merger would significantly expand LSE's information services business, which the bourse operator has been building as a more stable source of cash flow than its primary transaction-reliant businesses.
""The global exchanges are focusing more and more on data and technology as revenue drivers, and less on the actual matching of buys and sells,"" said Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and technology research at Greenwich Associates.
LSE operates equity and derivatives markets that include the London Stock Exchange, Borsa Italiana, MTS and Turquoise. It is also the majority owner of LCH, which dominates euro swaps clearing. Its information services business includes financial indexing, benchmarking and analytics services.
The company has a market value of about 19.3 billion pounds ($23.9 billion) and net debt of about 1 billion pounds.
LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer is a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) banker of 20 years who has raised expectations of big deals.
The LSE has failed several times to merge with rival Deutsche Boerse AG (DE:DB1Gn). Schwimmer was appointed CEO last August after the LSE's most recent attempt to do a deal with Deutsche Boerse failed.
Buying Refinitiv could help soften the blow for LSE from a bout of market volatility that is expected should Britain leave the European Union by an Oct. 31 deadline without an exit deal.
Schwimmer said last month that LSE was ""very prepared"" for Brexit. The exchange has had to open an EU base in Amsterdam for Turquoise, its London-based pan-European share trading platform.
QUICK FLIP
London-based Refinitiv provides financial markets data and infrastructure to more than 40,000 clients in over 190 countries, according to its website.
It caters to traders and investment professionals, who also use LSE's exchanges. It is the biggest client for news of Reuters News under a 30-year contract signed last year.
Thomson Reuters said in its statement on Friday that this contract will continue if Refinitiv's ownership changes.
Under Blackstone's majority ownership, Refinitiv has been shedding non-core assets. In April, it launched an initial public offering of  Tradeweb Markets Inc  (O:TW), an electronic trading platform for bonds and derivative instruments.
It has also been in talks with Deutsche Boerse about selling its foreign exchange electronic trading platform FXall.
Private equity firms such as Blackstone aim to buy businesses so they can subsequently sell them at a profit, typically between three and five years later.
A deal with London Stock Exchange for Refinitiv so soon after the carve-out from Thomson Reuters could prove to be a quick, profitable flip for Blackstone, which last week said its assets reached a record $545 billion.
Blackstone's consortium that holds a 55% stake in Refinitiv includes Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Special Investments Pte Ltd."
1375,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 08:12PM ET</span>",Democrat calls for 'good faith' talks with USTR on trade deal,"By Jonas Ekblom and Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic head of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee on Friday called for ""good faith"" negotiations with the Trump administration to address concerns about the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and pave the way for its passage.
U.S. Representative Richard Neal, chairman of the powerful committee, said Democrats had clearly explained what improvements they were seeking, but it was time for the Trump administration to respond with concrete proposals of its own.
""We remain committed to working diligently with Ambassador Lighthizer on this agreement. The timeline for consideration of the revised deal depends on the administration's willingness to negotiate with us in good faith to address House Democrats' concerns,"" Neal said in a statement after a Democratic working group met for a fourth time with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Friday.
The nine-lawmaker group told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a report on Friday that they had made ""substantial progress"" over the past few weeks, and would present USTR with a text next week memorializing the concrete and detailed proposals they had made.
""We have laid out clear and specific objectives and proposals designed to fix flaws in the new agreement affecting all stakeholders, especially American workers and regular people who need affordable access to healthcare and medicines,"" the report said. ""It is now USTR's turn to respond.""
Both sides were ready to work through the August recess to build on the progress made, the report said.
USTR declined to comment on the latest meeting with Democrats about the agreement that will replace the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
TOP PRIORITY
Republican President Donald Trump views ratification of the trade deal as a top priority, but Democrats say they will not move forward until their concerns over labor, environmental issues and access to medicine have been addressed.
Officials on both sides now say the deal could move forward in September after lawmakers return from the August recess.
Earl Blumenauer, the Oregon Democrat who leads the trade subcommittee of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee and is a member of the working group, told reporters that debate about the trade pact was far less contentious than it had been in earlier negotiations.
""It has been a productive three months,"" Blumenauer said. But he said Pelosi had made clear that she would not allow consideration of the agreement on the House floor until Democrats were satisfied with the revised deal.
""The charge we all share is to make sure that every Democrat feels that his or her interests have been heard. They may not all be satisfied,"" Blumenauer said.
Nearly 600 trade and commerce groups sent a letter to lawmakers this week urging quick approval of a deal they said would be a boon to the U.S. economy.
Leaders from the United States, Mexico and Canada signed the agreement in November, but it must be ratified by lawmakers in all three countries. Mexico has already ratified the deal.
Blumenauer said he was encouraged by Lighthizer's past record on enforcement and welcomed USTR's decision to direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to block future timber imports from Inversiones WCA E.I.R.L., a Peruvian exporter, given its use of illegally harvested timber.
The Oregon Democrat said he was open to a range of options to revise the USCMA, but said he remained skeptical about using so-called side agreements, which he said had proven problematic in the current trade agreement among the three nations.
The congressman said he returned from a bipartisan congressional visit to Mexico ""very impressed"" by the Mexican government and its ambitions, adding: ""It is clear that it is sincere.""
Members of the delegation also met with workers at a Goodyear (O:GT) plant in Mexico who were terminated a year ago for exercising their right to organize and seek better working conditions, but they were refused entry to the plant, he said.
Goodyear's decision to block the visit reinforced concerns that lawmakers have heard voiced by workers at the plant, he said, adding, ""I think it was a mistake on their part.""
In a statement, Goodyear said it was surprised to learn of the congressional delegation's visit to the plant.

""We did not have any direct correspondence with members of the CODEL (congressional delegation) and clearly informed the U.S. Consulate’s office who made the request that we could not accommodate a CODEL tour,"" the statement said.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 07:44PM ET</span>","U.S. Justice Department expected to approve Sprint, T-Mobile deal on Friday","By Diane Bartz and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc won U.S. antitrust approval for its $26 billion takeover of rival Sprint Corp, the Justice Department said Friday, clearing a major hurdle to a deal that merges the nation's third and fourth largest wireless carriers. 
The companies have agreed to divest Sprint's prepaid businesses, including Boost Mobile, to satellite television firm Dish Network Corp to create a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. 
The Justice Department indicated the deal would improve competition and the rollout of faster 5G networks by combining weaker players and creating a strong, new No. 4, in Dish, that has unused spectrum, which can be activated. Critics, including some state attorneys general, say competition won't increase and prices for mobile phone plans will rise.
The deal is a clear success for T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere, who will be the CEO of the combined company and who pushed back at critics arguing a more concentrated market would lead to higher prices.
""It's a bit dumbfounding to think that we've decided to go and build this network and go through this merger so that we can become the basic, lazy, fat, dumb and arrogant players that we were born to teach how to behave,"" he told analysts in a conference call.
Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said the deal would hasten the development of 5G, the next generation of wireless.
Shares of T-Mobile, which is about 63 percent owned by Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), were up 5.3% at $84.17. Shares of Sprint, which is about 84 percent owned by Softbank Group Corp, rose 7.1% to $7.97. Dish was up 0.7% at $39.44.
But the deal still faces a significant challenge: A group of U.S. state attorneys general, including from New York and California, have sued to block the merger on antitrust grounds, arguing the proposed deal would cost consumers more than $4.5 billion annually.
New York State Attorney General Letitia James indicated the lawsuit would continue, at least in part because of what critics see as Dish's failure to live up to pledges it had made.
""We have serious concerns that cobbling together this new fourth mobile player, with the government picking winners and losers, will not address the merger’s harm to consumers, workers, and innovation,"" she said. 
The Justice Department, backed by five state attorneys general, said the deal required the merging companies to sell Virgin Mobile and Sprint's prepaid business and provide Dish with access to 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations.
Prepaid wireless phones are generally sought by lower-income people who cannot pass a credit check.
Dish has agreed to acquire spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, in a deal valued at $3.6 billion from the merged firm and pay $1.4 billion for Sprint's prepaid business that serves about 9.3 million customers. Dish will get access to the new T-Mobile's network for seven years while it builds its own 5G network.
T-Mobile and Dish are also required to work out a deal where T-Mobile can use Dish's unused 600 MHz spectrum and the companies are required to use eSIM, which allows consumers to switch easily between carriers, a Justice Department official said.
SKEPTICAL LAWMAKERS
T-Mobile competes with  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc (N:T). 
U.S. consumers tend to stick with one mobile carrier for years, giving companies a steady stream of cash. As more people rely on cell phones for social media, banking or news and entertainment, the lines have blurred between telecom, content and cable companies, just as so-called 5G technology promises to make mobile phones even more powerful.
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement on Friday he would soon circulate a formal order supporting the deal. The FCC could vote on final approval in August or September, officials said.
The FCC agreed to give Dish more time to use spectrum it previously acquired. The company could face up to $2.2 billion in penalties and lose its spectrum licenses if it fails to meet its commitments to build its network, according to a letter filed Friday with the FCC. Dish must have a 5G network covering at least 70% of the U.S. population no later than June 14, 2023. 
Dish has spent years stockpiling wireless spectrum and faced a looming March 2020 deadline to build a product using the spectrum in order to fulfill its license requirements. 
Some senior lawmakers remained skeptical about the merger, including Senators Mike Lee, a Republican, and Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, the top lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee.
Lee said he was hopeful the divestiture would succeed but uneasy about Dish's dual role as a critic of the transaction and a buyer of divested assets.

Klobuchar, who is running for president, reiterated that she had wanted the deal stopped. ""It looked like a bad deal then, and it looks like a bad deal today, despite the parties’ promises and this proposed consent decree,” she said.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 07:36PM ET</span>",U.S. to deny tariff relief for Apple Mac Pro parts from China: Trump,"By David Shepardson and Susan Heavey
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said his administration would not grant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) any relief for tariffs on parts made in China for its Mac Pro computer and later added he thought the firm would build a plant in Texas.
""Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!"" Trump tweeted.
On July 18, Apple asked the U.S. Trade Representative's office to waive 25% tariffs on 15 parts, including ones for the Mac Pro desktop computer. The public comment period for those requests closes on Aug. 1.
Trump later told reporters he thought Apple would build a plant in Texas, without elaborating on exactly what he was referring to or how he knew.
""I want Apple to build their plants in the United States. I don't want them to build them in China. So when I heard they were going to build it in China, I said, 'No, that's OK, you can build it in China but when you send your product into the United States we're going to tariff you,"" he said.
""We'll work it out,"" he said. ""I think they're going to announce that they're going to build a plant in Texas. And if they do that, I'm starting to get very happy.""
The Wall Street Journal reported in June that Apple is shifting manufacturing of its new Mac Pro desktop computer to China from Texas.
Apple issued a statement at the time that ""like all of our products, the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in California and includes components from several countries including the United States"" and emphasized that ""final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process.""
Representatives for Apple had no immediate comment on either the tariff or Texas plant comments on Friday. Shares of the company sharply pared their gains after the tweets. 
Apple CEO Tim Cook in December 2013 announced the company was building the Mac Pro in Texas after coming under criticism for assembling most of its products in lower-wage countries.
Apple does not disclose sales figures for its Mac Pro, but analysts do not believe it is a high-volume seller for the company compared to the iPhone. Priced at $6,000 and up, it is aimed at professional users such as movie and music studios.
Trump has previously made claims about Apple's plans to build new U.S. plants, which have not materialized. 
Apple did say in December it would build a second campus in Austin, Texas. The company is also spending $390 million with supplier Finisar Corp that helped the chipmaker re-open a 700,000-square-foot factory in Texas. 
TRADE WAR 
Trump has levied billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese imports and threatened to impose levies on another $325 billion of Chinese goods if no progress is reached in a trade dispute that has disrupted global supply chains and shaken financial markets. 
For Apple, China is both a key market and a major production center for its devices. The company got nearly 18% of its total revenue from Greater China in the quarter that ended in March.
Apple in June asked its major suppliers to assess the cost implications of moving 15% to 30% of its production capacity from China to Southeast Asia, according to a Nikkei report.
In its submissions to the U.S. Trade Representative asking for the waivers, Apple said the products were part of a consumer electronic device and ""not strategically important or related to Chinese industrial programs, such as ""Made in China 2020."" 
The parts include graphics processing modules, structural frames, power supply units, AC power cables, ladder assemblies, data cables and a wireless mouse line.
Some Apple products such as the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones faced a potential 25% tariff last year, but officials spared Apple and other electronics makers such as Fitbit Inc in September.

The Trump administration has denied numerous other tariff exclusion requests from major companies including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) for its Chinese-made Buick Envision, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc for components for its electric vehicles and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc for electric bikes.

The gains were due to strong earnings Thursday for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), up 10%, and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), up 8.9% and the federal government's approval of T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) $26-billion deal to merge with Sprint (NYSE:S). T-Mobile climbed 5.6%. Sprint rose 7.4%.
The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,026 with a 0.7% gain. The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indices jumped more than 1% each. All three indices reached new intraday highs as well.
The Dow was up a more modest 0.2%, led by Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), up 2.1%, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), up 1.74%, and health-insurer UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), up 1.7%. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also hit a new intraday high of $141.71 and closed up 0.8% at a record $141.34.
The blue-chip index continued to be held back by continuing weakness in shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA), which is struggling to get its 737 Max jetliner back into service. The plane has been grounded since March after fatal crashes of the plane in Ethiopia and Indonesia, and it's possible the plane would go back into service until January.
Boeing was off 0.9% and subtracted 21 points from the Dow on Friday. It was off 8.6% on the week.
The market mostly embraced a Commerce Department report that U.S. gross domestic product grew 2.1% in the second quarter, compared with a 1.8% estimate.
But earnings reports this week proved to have much more influence.
The S&P 500 was up 1.7% for the week, with the Nasdaq up 2.23%. The Dow added 0.14%. For the year, the S&P 500 is up 20.7%, with the Nasdaq up 25.5% and the Dow up 16.6%.
And investors seem to believe that economic growth will push higher if, as expected, the Federal Reserve cuts its key interest rate next week. The Fed decision is due Wednesday afternoon. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool says there's a 100% chance the Fed's key rate, the federal funds rate, will drop to 2% to 2.25%, down from 2.25% to 2.5% now. 
The Trump administration has been pushing for lower rates to push the value of the dollar lower against major currencies. There was some talk this week the Administration might sell dollars to push the greenback lower. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, is up 25% since the end of 2009.
Next week has two big news-making events.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) weighs in with fiscal-third-quarter results after Tuesday's close. Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the iPhone maker to report $2.09 a share in earnings down from $2.16 a year ago, with revenue of $53.35 billion, up slightly from a year ago. Apple shares are up 33% this year after falling 6.7% in 2018 and 30% in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Friday brings the July jobs report. 
Oil prices moved up slightly with  West Texas intermediate crude rising 18 cents to $56.20 a barrel. Brent oil futures added 7 cents to $63.46.
Interest rates were flat to lower, with the 10-Year yield falling to 2.072% from Thursday's 2.083%.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 01:58PM ET</span>","Trump's ambitious Fannie, Freddie overhaul faces hurdles","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration faces a growing list of hurdles that could scuttle its ambitions to remove U.S. mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from their government lifeline.
Fannie and Freddie have been in conservatorship since they were bailed out during the 2008 financial crisis. In March, the administration said it was devising a plan to put them back on their feet, raising market hopes that the pair might seek a jumbo initial public offering as early as next year.
But as the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and the U.S. Treasury begin to dig into the details, reality is starting to bite. From securing a federal guarantee to extricating the Treasury from its holdings, there is too much to do before the 2020 presidential election, analysts and housing experts said.
The U.S. Treasury Department is already stretched by the trade war with China and sanctions issues, they noted. 
Mark Calabria, director of the FHFA which controls Fannie and Freddie, told Reuters last week he hoped the pair would be ready to exit conservatorship within five years, offering the clearest signal yet a speedy overhaul is unlikely.
""You're trying to reform what is the financing behind one-sixth of the economy,"" said Pete Mills, senior vice president at the Mortgage Bankers Association. ""You've got to do it in a way that doesn't disrupt the marketplace, and that's the challenge.""
One key emerging question is whether the government would stand behind Fannie and Freddie once it stops running them. Although Calabria can remove the pair from conservatorship without a guarantee, doing so would likely push up the price of their securities and, in turn, mortgage costs for homeowners.
Calabria told Reuters he does not want to disrupt the housing market but hoped that by taking the first steps toward reforming Fannie and Freddie he will spur Congress to create an explicit guarantee for the pair's securities. 
However, several congressional sources and lobbyists said key committees had made little progress on housing finance reform and lawmakers are unlikely to agree on a guarantee before the end of 2020. 
A Treasury spokesman declined to comment. White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement it was ""long past time for the United States to reform its housing finance system.""
CHARTING A COURSE
FHFA and Treasury also have to agree on a plan for raising at least $100 billion of fresh capital for the firms. 
Treasury holds warrants representing 80% of Fannie and Freddie's common stock, as well as senior preferred stock. Under the current terms of the preferred stock agreement, Treasury is guaranteed a 10% dividend and sweeps the firms' quarterly net profits into its coffers. That arrangement has left Fannie and Freddie with just around $3 billion of capital each. 
Since taking control, the government has injected $191.5 billion into the pair to keep them afloat. However, the Treasury has received $292 billion back from them, according to public data. 
For the first quarter of 2019, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported $2.4 billion and $1.7 billion in net income, respectively. Both amounts were paid directly to the Treasury.
The industry expected Calabria to begin rebuilding the pair's capital by ending the profit sweep and retaining their earnings. But last week he told Reuters he wanted to make that change ""holistically"" as part of a broader renegotiation of the preferred stock agreement terms.
In addition to ending the profit sweep, those talks would have to remove restrictions on the mortgage giants raising fresh capital and address what, if any, dividend Treasury would receive. FHFA and Treasury would also likely have to agree with the Federal Reserve on the terms of a line of government credit.
""What's fair for the taxpayers' investment, but what's sustainable for a path out?"" said Calabria, describing the dilemma.
Only once those terms are agreed can Treasury chart a course for selling its holdings, which could prove a lengthy process. It took the government several offerings spread over 19 months to unload its stock in insurer American International Group (NYSE:AIG), for example.
A potential Fannie and Freddie IPO will require the firms to clean up their business lines, accounting and corporate governance, Calabria said. He added that the firms also have ""supervisory deficiencies"" to fix, without elaborating. 
In the meantime, regulators have to finish a capital rule for Fannie and Freddie and decide how they would rework rules defining high-quality mortgages.]

""There are a series of very important questions that need answers before investors would be willing to dedicate private capital to these entities,"" said Ed Mills, a Washington policy analyst with Raymond James.

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 01:51PM ET</span>",Mining mogul Agarwal made just 6% profit on Anglo investment: Reuters estimate,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Clara Denina
LONDON (Reuters) - Mining mogul Anil Agarwal pocketed just 6% profit from his 3.5 billion pound ($4.3 billion) investment in  Anglo American  (L:AAL), held since 2017, even though the underlying shares rose over 50% since then, according to Reuters estimates.
Agarwal's family vehicle Volcan Investments, the biggest shareholder in Anglo, said on Thursday it would unwind its almost-20% stake in the South African miner by repaying debt with 247.1 million Anglo shares.
After paying back the loan, Volcan would have been left with a 1.9% stake that was sold in the open market for 519 million pounds on Thursday. This makes up his gross profit from the whole investment, according to a source familiar with the deal.
Once coupon payments and the investment banking fees are accounted for, the sum dwindles to 196.25 million-213.7 million pounds, or 5.7%-6.1% of the original deal size, a Reuters calculation shows.
Under the terms of the original deal, Volcan borrowed 3.5 billion pounds through the issuance of a mandatory convertible bond arranged by U.S. investment bank JPMorgan (N:JPM) to fund the acquisition.
The convoluted structure, dubbed ""POEMS"" (Purchaser of Equity via Mandatory Securities) by JPMorgan, is a variation of the more traditional ""exchangeable bond"" format, where a borrower issues debt that can be converted into shares of another company.
Volcan Investments and JPMorgan declined to comment.
The first bond would have matured in April 2020, if the Indian billionaire had not cashed out, dashing speculation that he was preparing to take over the 30.8 billion pound diversified miner.
The nature of the convertible bond issuance, however, meant that Agarwal's profit was just a fraction of the London-listed miner's massive increase in value of an average 7 pounds per share over the past two years.
Agarwal's gross profit is the 24.7 million shares, or about 1.9% of Anglo, he was left with after repaying the bond. JP Morgan arranged a sale of those shares for 519 million pounds on Thursday.
On top of that, there is the 4% coupon paid on the debt, which comes at about 280 million pounds over a two-year period, and the fees paid to JPMorgan.
M&A consultancy Freeman Consulting Services said convertible bonds issued by Anglo American typically garner fees of around 0.75%-1.25% of the transaction size.
Assuming JPMorgan charged Volcan a similar fee for this convoluted structure, the total cost to Agarwal is 26.25 million to 43.75 million pounds."

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 01:09PM ET</span>",China's Wanda Sports raises $190.4 million in downsized IPO,"By Julie Zhu and Joshua Franklin
HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wanda Sports Group (O:WSG), a sport events owner whose interests include the distribution of media rights in Asia for the FIFA World Cup, said on Friday it priced a smaller-than-expected U.S. initial public offering (IPO) below its targeted range to raise $190.4 million. The Beijing-based company, a unit of Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, sold about 23.8 million American depositary shares (ADS) at $8 each, compared with a previously stated target of selling 28 million ADS between $9 to $11.
The weak pricing values the owner of Infront Sports & Media AG, a Swiss sports marketing company, and World Triathlon Corp, the organizer and promoter of the Ironman race, at around $1 billion. 
It indicates tepid U.S. investor demand for Chinese stocks after China's largest live-streaming platform  DouYu International Holdings  (O:DOYU) priced its $775 million Nasdaq IPO at the bottom of a price range last week. 
On Wednesday, Wanda Sports had already cut the size of its IPO to up to $308 million from a previous size of up to $500 million.
Wanda Sports, which owns sports properties and generates revenue from events operation, sponsorship and media production, in 2018 reported a profit of 54 million euros ($60 million), a 31% drop from a year earlier. The company recorded a loss of 8.6 million euros in the first three months of 2019. 
The IPO follows a string of assets sales by parent Dalian Wanda, which had built a sprawling business empire ranging from real estate to sport to cinemas. In 2015, the conglomerate acquired Infront Sports & Media and World Triathlon for $1.2 billion and $650 million, respectively. 
However, the company, owned by Wang Jianlin, one of China's richest men, has been rattled in the past years by a government-led crackdown on overseas deals and high leverage. 
Wanda Sports plans to use the IPO proceeds to repay debt, fund strategic investments and for general corporate purposes.
Wanda Sports is due to start trading later on Friday under the symbol ""WSG"" on the Nasdaq stock exchange. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are the leading banks of the IPO.

Trump, in a tweet, did not offer any evidence of a problem with Google's business in China but said if there were any issues, his administration would find out about it.
On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he and Trump had both had direct talks with Google's chief executive and were assured that the tech company's work with China was ""very, very limited.""
""The president and I did diligence on this issue, and we’re not aware of any areas where Google working with the Chinese government in a way that in any way raises concerns,"" Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview. ""Google is an American company that wants to help out the U.S.""
Trump has repeatedly slammed U.S. technology companies, including Google, and alleged without offering any evidence that they have discriminated against him and fellow conservatives. He met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai at a White House meeting on Monday with a number of other top tech executives.
""There may or may not be National Security concerns with regard to Google and their relationship with China. If there is a problem, we will find out about it. I sincerely hope there is not!!!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Google, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, declined to comment. Earlier this month, the company’s top government affairs official said at a U.S. Senate hearing that it did little business in China.
""Fundamentally in China we actually do very little today, certainly compared to any other major technology company,"" said Karan Bhatia, vice president for government affairs and public policy.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is working to revise securities and criminal laws as soon as possible in a bid to raise maximum prison terms and fines, the regulator said in a statement on its website.
CSRC, which has made similar statements in the past, did not give a timetable.
Under the current securities law, a listed company that makes false disclosure is fined up to 600,000 yuan ($87,232), while the criminal law states those who conceal or intentionally destroy accounting records can be imprisoned for up to five years and fined up to 200,000 yuan.
CSRC, which made the statement in response to criticism that the cost of cheating in capital markets is too low, said that current laws were too lenient.
CSRC also said it would severely punish negligent auditors and investment bankers and actively support compensation claims made by victims of crime.
There has been a slew of cases recently involving dishonest disclosures by China-listed companies.
Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co (SS:600518), which overstated cash holdings in 2017 by $4.4 billion, faked its books for three consecutive years during 2016-2018, CSRC said in May following an investigation.
In another high-profile scandal, Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co (SZ:002450), a producer of high polymer materials, cooked its books between 2015 and 2018, CSRC said on July 5.

1404,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 10:59AM ET</span>","Twitter shares jump 10% on solid user growth, revenue beat","By Elizabeth Culliford and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) on Friday reported better-than-expected second-quarter revenue as design changes to its microblogging website attracted more users and advertisers, sending its shares up 10%.
Twitter's revenue and number of users have been in focus since the social media platform started deleting millions of spam or fake accounts promoting hate speech or spreading political misinformation, contributing to declines in monthly users through 2018.
Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said the platform saw an 18% drop in reports of spammy or suspicious behavior across all Tweet detail pages, which show the replies to any given Tweet on the service.
The company reported a rise in monthly active users in the first quarter, fueling speculation that Twitter was returning to growth, but has since stopped disclosing its MAU count.
Instead, this quarter it reported monetizable daily active usage (mDAU), a metric it created to measure only users exposed on a daily basis to advertising on the site and exclude those who access Twitter via aggregating sites like TweetDeck.
Its monetizable daily active usage (mDAU) hit 139 million, beating analyst expectations of 135 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""The strong growth in monetizable daily active users shows that Twitter users are sticking with the platform, and that should resonate with advertisers,"" eMarketer senior analyst Jasmine Enberg said.
Dorsey said machine learning improvements to deliver more relevant content helped drive up this count. ""We approach every problem now with technology first, and that has been a pretty marked shift within the company,"" he said.
Twitter's revenue rose 18% from a year earlier to $841 million, beating Wall Street expectations of $829 million, based on Refinitiv data.
Total advertising revenue rose to $727 million, an increase of 21% year-on-year, as the company continued to improve its ad platform and formats.
Twitter has continued to bulk up its live and on-demand video content partnerships. On Thursday, NBCUniversal said they would team up to livestream parts of the 2022 Olympic Games, Twitter's latest move in a series of deals aimed at boosting sports conversation on the platform.
It also expanded its multimedia features, launching a Snapchat-style camera feature in the Twitter app and releasing its own long-awaited tool for clipping and publishing video.
Twitter also recently updated its policies on hateful conduct directed at religious groups and last month introduced a new policy to de-emphasize and label rule-breaking tweets from important sources like politicians, though this has not yet been used.
WEAK FORECAST, HIGHER EXPENSES
However, Twitter forecast third-quarter revenue between $815 million and $875 million, the midpoint of which was below analysts estimates of $869.3 million, partly due to ending some older ad formats.
Total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 21% to $766 million, partly due to plans to hire more employees and reiterated that operating expenses would grow about 20% in 2019.
Twitter's results come against the backdrop of regulatory scrutiny against big tech and social media firms like  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Twitter has also constantly been in the spotlight due to U.S. President Donald Trump's prominent use, as well as criticism, of the platform.
Twitter reported second-quarter profit of $1.1 billion, or $1.43 per share, compared with $100 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. Profit was boosted by an income tax benefit of over $1 billion related to corporate restructuring."

Invimit, an asset-management company owned by Italy's economy ministry, will team up with Deloitte to create the fund, which will be called Dante. Its assets will be public properties in city centers that are already rented out or soon will be. Legal firm DLA Piper will also act as adviser.
Italy plans to raise 950 million euros ($1.1 billion) from the sale and rental of its properties in 2019 and 300 million euros in the following two years.
Invimit is required to contribute 610 million euros, 500 million through the Dante fund and 110 million through the direct sale of properties.
""We expect to become the hub for investors who want to enter the public real estate market in Italy"", Invimit CEO Giovanna Della Posta told Reuters.
Under European Union budget rules, property disposals reduce both public debt and deficit. They will help Italy to meet a 2019 budget deficit goal of 2% of its gross domestic product that it agreed with the European Commission earlier this month.
The Treasury is expected to approve a decree to regulate the fund next week. After that, Invimit will organize a roadshow to sell shares in the Dante fund to domestic and foreign investors.
""We aim to close the placement at the beginning of October,"" Della Posta said, adding she was confident the fund would offer an interesting return on investment.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. FedEx Corp (N:FDX) on Friday again apologized and blamed Washington's ban on Huawei for being ""unclear"" as Beijing deepened an investigation into why the delivery firm was holding up packages meant for the telecoms equipment maker.
Huawei was placed by Washington on a blacklist in mid-May that effectively blocks U.S. firms from doing business with the Shenzhen-based firm.
Chinese authorities investigating FedEx suspect it illegally held back more than 100 Huawei [HWT.UL] packages and has also violated other laws, state news agency Xinhua reported on Friday. 
FedEx in a statement on Friday afternoon said, ""These shipments in question were handled while we were trying to comply with the U.S. DOC BIS order which was unclear and resulted in considerable complexity for our operations. We apologize for any confusion or harm to our customers as a result.""
Beijing started a probe into FedEx last month after Huawei said the U.S. delivery firm had diverted parcels intended for the company. Xinhua said on Friday that investigators also discovered ""clues to other violations"". 
On Thursday, Huawei had accused U.S.-listed Flex (O:FLEX) of seizing its goods in China. 
The developments mark the latest fallout from Washington's trade ban on Huawei, which has not only rattled the global technology supply chain tied to Huawei's $105 billion business but also is causing much confusion among companies and organizations well beyond the U.S. borders regarding the limits of restrictions.
FedEx has apologized for multiple incidents of diversion of Huawei packages, which it attributed to ""operational errors"", but it later sued the U.S. government for what it said was an ""impossible task"" to ""police the contents"" of export shipments. 
FedEx said on Friday that it initiated the suit against the U.S. DOC ""to prevent similar occurrences happening in the future"" and reiterated its commitment to the Chinese market. 
Huawei told Reuters on Thursday that Flex had withheld some 700 million yuan ($102 million) worth of its goods in its China factory, confirming a report by Chinese government-backed newspaper Global Times. 
Flex kept the Huawei assets in its factory in the southern city of Zhuhai after the U.S. blacklisting and caused losses for Huawei, according to the report.
Huawei told Reuters that it has retrieved some 400 million yuan of goods last month after negotiations and is still trying to take back the rest. 
Flex said in an emailed statement to Reuters, ""Flex and Huawei have had a long-standing and successful partnership which has recently been impacted by unforeseen challenges resulting from the US/China trade situation. Both parties are actively working to find a mutually agreeable way forward given these facts.""
A Flex spokesman declined to say whether it still held any Huawei assets or counts Huawei as a customer, but said China remains ""a very important center of production and end-market"" where it employs tens of thousands of people. 
Flex said on Friday in its quarterly earnings statement that it would accelerate a move to reduce its exposure to certain products in China and India after ""recent geopolitical developments and uncertainties"", which primarily impacted ""one customer in China"". It did not name the customer.
""We have seen a reduction in demand for products assembled for that customer,"" it said.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) beat quarterly sales expectations at established U.S. restaurants on Friday, as the world's largest burger chain's attracted more diners with upgraded stores and new promotions, such as the 2 for $5 Mix and Match deal.
The company's stock, a component of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial index (DJI), rose as much as 2% to a record high of $218.96 in morning trading, the third major restaurant chain to hit a peak this week.
McDonald's is the latest restaurant chain to report solid growth driven by new menu additions, expanded delivery services and tech-enhanced stores after strong U.S. sales numbers from  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) and  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX).
""These three (companies) are using their operating scale and their business strength to essentially outflank smaller competitors and generate very strong sales growth and bottom line profits,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Bob Derrington said. 
The U.S. restaurant market has been stagnant with lower customer traffic in recent years, dogged by increasing number of competitors among fast-food chains and the entry of delivery services such as DoorDash and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, forcing established chains to find new ways of attracting and retaining customers. 
McDonald's, like many of its peers, has been remodeling its 14,000 restaurants in the United States - its biggest market - by introducing digital ordering kiosks and new mobile order, pay and pickup services to replicate the success of such upgrades in driving growth abroad.
The Chicago-headquartered company has also tweaked its menu by offering national deals $1, $2, $3 Menu as well as greater variety of breakfast menus and switched many of its burgers to fresh-beef patties from frozen ones to woo diners in a saturated market.
Sales at U.S. restaurants open for at least 13 months rose 5.7% in the second quarter ended June 30, above the 4.47% growth expected by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Globally, same-store sales rose 6.5%, also topping estimates of 5.08%, helped by strong performance in UK, France and Germany. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2yd7dnM)
""By engaging our guests on their terms, whether it's through delivery, an enhanced dining experience ... or through our evolving digital offerings, we're becoming a better McDonald's,"" Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said in a statement.
Total revenue was flat at $5.34 billion, still slightly above expectations of $5.33 billion.
Net income rose 1.38% to $1.52 billion. Excluding one-time items, McDonald's earned $2.05 per share, meeting Wall Street expectations.

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 09:51AM ET</span>",DWS taps into infrastructure boom with new $2.7 billion fund: sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Arno Schuetze
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) asset manager DWS (DE:DWSG) is in talks to raise at least 2.5 billion euros ($2.78 billion) for a new infrastructure fund, three sources told Reuters, tapping into strong investor demand for the asset class.
DWS, 79.5% owned by  Deutsche Bank , aims to reach the first close of the fund soon after the summer, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The fund is expected to beat its 2.5 billion euro target, securing slightly more than 3 billion euros ($3.34 billion) with a first close of almost 1.5 billion euros to be announced towards the end of September, the sources said.
The new fund, known as PEIF III, will be launched next year, they said.
A DWS spokesman declined to comment.
The plan comes as several international investment firms, including Australia's Macquarie (AX:MQG) and France's Ardian, have also recently raised new mega funds taking advantage of investors' confidence that infrastructure will deliver strong returns in a low interest rate environment.
DWS, which last month bought Belgian public transport operator Hansea, is primarily targeting infrastructure investments in the transportation, telecoms and energy sectors, the source said.
It will also allocate part of its new fund to so-called ""core plus infrastructure"" which typically includes assets in adjacent sectors such as smart grids and services businesses.
The Frankfurt-based asset manager, which had 719 billion euros of assets under management as of June 30, raised 1.8 billion euros in 2017 for its second pan-European infrastructure fund along with an additional 800 million euros allocated to co-investments.
The company, which has a market value of around 6.2 billion euros, has been a prolific buyer of infrastructure businesses, bidding for anything from motorways and airports in countries including Britain, Germany and Italy.
It recently expressed interest in taking control of British rail and bus firm Arriva which is in the process of being auctioned off by owner Deutsche Bahn.
Earlier this year, DWS teamed up with Dutch pension fund PGGM for a 26 percent stake in German utility EWE, with final bids due in September, sources previously said.
DWS's fundraising follows last month's closing of Macquarie's sixth European Infrastructure Fund with 6 billion euros of committed capital which went well beyond its initial target of 5 billion euros.
French investment firm Ardian raised 6.1 billion euros for its fifth fund in March, taking less than six months to fulfil its fundraising ambitions."

On Tuesday, the Oslo-based company pared its demand growth forecast for a second time this year, echoing the dimming outlook painted by top U.S. producer Alcoa Corp. last week. Russian giant United Co. Rusal chimed in with similar comments in a trading update on Friday that warned on aluminum demand for the second half.
“With the turmoil that’s going on now, it’s hard to see how it will play out,"" Aasheim said in a phone interview Thursday. Asked if she sees aluminum demand bouncing back, she said “not at this point."" Hydro owns Alunorte, the world’s largest refinery that produces alumina -- the key raw material for the metal.
Aluminum in London has tumbled 13% in the past year amid mounting concerns trade frictions will dim growth prospects, hurting consumption of the metal used in airplanes, automobiles and beer cans. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund said the world economy will expand 3.2% this, weaker than forecast in April and the slowest pace since the financial crisis.
The metal for delivery in three months fell 1.3% to $1,803 a metric ton at 2:03 p.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
“One thing that hurts global growth over time is uncertainty, it affects peoples’ ability and willingness to do capital investments and at the end of the day affects individuals ability and willingness to consume,” Hydro Chief Financial Officer Eivind Kallevik said in the same interview. “It doesn’t mean that if all trade wars are cleared up tomorrow that it would be a great day the day after, but it would certainly send things in a different direction.”
Capacity Stalls
About 12% off smelters are operating at a loss, while capacity additions in China, the world’s top producer and consumer of the metal, have stalled due to low prices, Rusal said in its second quarter results Thursday. The is despite aluminum being in deficit over the first half.
On Tuesday, Oslo-based Hydro predicted that this year’s aluminum demand will grow by 1% to 2%, compared with a forecast range of 1% to 3% in April. The company cited signs of weakness in some market segments and warned of downside risks to its outlook.
Hydro expects its Alunorte facility in Brazil to boost alumina output to as much as 95% of capacity by December, from a range of 80% to 85% now, Aasheim said. The refinery is close to returning to normal operations after a local court ordered it to cut output to 50% of capacity last year. The company’s legal troubles in the South American nation began in early 2018 when heavy rains allegedly caused waste water to leak into local water supplies."

Here's a fresh rundown of how tariffs are hurting bottom lines, realigning supply chains and weighing on the outlook for manufacturing:

  Caterpillar   Inc (NYSE:CAT), the U.S. maker of heavy machinery, said sales growth at dealerships in June was the slowest in two years. One analyst called the company's results a warning shot for capital spending broadly.
Royal Philips (NYSE:PHG), the Dutch maker of goods ranging from medical scanners to electric toothbrushes, is realigning its business into regional manufacturing hubs to contain the fallout from the trade war.
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) had second-quarter earnings dented by tariffs. But the Milwaukee motorcycle maker got approval from the European Union to import bikes from Thailand and mitigate almost all of the $100 million hit it’s feeling from tariffs this year.
BASF (OTC:BASFY), the maker of plastics, pesticides and lubricant additives, is particularly exposed to export-reliant economies in Europe and Asia. The German company reported disappointing results reflecting a downshifting global economy and doesn’t see the situation improving in the second half.
Oslo-based aluminium giant Norsk Hydro (OTC:NHYDY) pared its demand growth forecast for a second time this year, echoing the outlook from top U.S. producer   Alcoa   (NYSE:AA). Russian giant United Co. Rusal chimed in with similar comments.
The trade tensions have worsened an already tough environment for car makers.   Renault   (PA:RENA) lowered its outlook for full-year sales and Ford (NYSE:F) missed earnings estimates. German auto parts supplier   Continental AG   (DE:CONG) joined French rival in predicting a significant slowdown in worldwide vehicle output.
Worried about another wave of tariffs, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) is accelerating plans to shift away from China to new plants in Vietnam and India. The world's largest publicly traded toy maker said U.S. goods produced in China could drop to about 50% by the end of 2020, from just under two-thirds currently.
Next week brings a gust of new manufacturing data. Monthly surveys of purchasing managers are due out Wednesday in China and Thursday in Europe’s big economies. In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s new monthly figures are scheduled for release Thursday.

Charting the Trade War
Global trade languished for a seventh straight month in May, new figures show, as a tariff battle between the U.S. and China heighten uncertainty that’s slowing growth in Europe and elsewhere in Asia.

1423,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 06:42AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Vodafone Goes Ker-Ching; Kering Goes Gooey Over Gucci,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- It’s official:  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) is cooler than Gucci.
Well, ok, not really, but the thing that leaps out from the stock market boards in Europe on Friday is that the debt-laden telecoms group is up over 7%, and  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the holding company for one of the world’s most famous fashion brands, is down by a similar amount amid concerns over a weakening outlook.
Vodafone’s (relatively) new chief executive Nick Read has finally unveiled measures to cut the group’s debt burden substantially, by spinning off its forest of mobile masts around Europe into a separate company.
At the same time, the company also reported an improved operating performance, with last year’s decision to bulk up in Germany starting to pay off and market conditions in Italy improving, after repeated disappointments in recent years.
""We are now at a turning point in our service revenue following the low point in Q4 of last fiscal year,” Reuters reported Read as saying on a conference call. ""We are confident that this improvement in service revenue will continue as the year progresses.""
Vodafone’s shares have now regained the level they were at two months ago, when Read took the painful but inevitable decision to cut the company’s dividend for the first time ever. 
By contrast,  Kering  (PA:PRTP), which has been a market darling for most of recent history due to its exposure to fast-growing demand in China and the U.S., fell as much as 8% before recovering slightly. Its second-quarter earnings, released after the close on Thursday, showed that sales of Gucci actually fell in the U.S. by 2%, from a 5% rise three months earlier.
It’s the second quarter in a row that Gucci sales have triggered a sell-off in the shares (which are now down 12% from the all-time high that they hit in March).
At least  Kering  (PA:PRTP) still has the comfort of knowing that the European Central Bank is trying to keep the euro competitive, for all of President Mario Draghi’s protestations that the bank doesn’t target the exchange rate. After initially rising Thursday on disappointment about the lack of policy easing from the ECB, the euro has now reversed against the dollar and is heading lower again.
That was supporting markets across the euro zone Friday, pushing the benchmark Stoxx 600 up 0.2% to 390.28 by 5:25 AM ET (0925 ET). Spain’s IBEX 35 lagged, falling 0.7% on weak earnings from the banking sector and the prospect of yet another election after Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez failed to form a majority in parliament. The U.K. FTSE 100 was the biggest gainer among the major indexes, rising 0.3% - largely thanks to Vodafone."

“It is not true that its wrong transfer of Huawei parcels were operational errors,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a briefing in Beijing on Friday. “During our investigation we also found out other FedEx activities in violation of the law so we will continue to have in-depth investigations on it.”
The case has stoked concerns that Beijing is starting to crack down on U.S. companies -- a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. venture was recently fined -- in retaliation for Washington placing curbs on Huawei. The moves come amid the broader backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war, which has seen relations between the two superpowers deteriorate and prompted some companies to shift production out of China.
The official Xinhua news agency said earlier in a Weibo posting that FedEx is suspected of holding up more than 100 inbound deliveries involving the Chinese telecommunications giant. FedEx said it’s following up on China’s findings and that it will continue to cooperate with authorities. Huawei declined to comment.
China has been preparing to add FedEx to a blacklist of so-called unreliable entities, people familiar with the matter have said. When China first announced in May its plans to create the list, it said it would target firms that damage the interests of domestic companies but didn’t name any specific firms.
Diverted Packages
The Memphis, Tennessee-based courier first drew the ire of Chinese officials after Huawei said that documents it asked to be shipped from Japan to China were instead diverted to the U.S. without authorization. In a separate incident in June, FedEx said it rejected a package containing a Huawei phone being sent to the U.S. from the U.K. by mistake. Chinese authorities are continuing their probe of FedEx, according to Xinhua.
FedEx shares slipped 0.1% to $175.87 in New York on Thursday. The stock has gained 9% this year.
In its statement, FedEx said the shipments in question were rerouted because the company was trying to comply with “unclear” orders from the U.S. Commerce Department that have complicated operations. That’s why it sued the U.S. government, FedEx added.
The company recently sued the commerce department to block enforcement of tougher restrictions on exports and imports, saying the curbs force it “to police the contents” of millions of packages. In response, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business that FedEx is misinterpreting the rules because the U.S. isn’t asking companies to be a policeman, “just asking them not to conspire.”
The company doesn’t break out its China earnings but in September, it said that package deliveries between the U.S. and China represented 2% of total sales, which would be about $1.3 billion based on 2018 revenue.
FedEx’s woes could be a boon for the competition. China’s State Post Bureau said earlier this month the country plans to encourage its logistics companies to invest overseas to help strengthen their international competitiveness.
Meanwhile, negotiators are preparing for the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks in Shanghai next week."

Australia's fourth-largest bank said on Friday that the breach was not a cyber-security issue, adding that no log-in details or passwords were compromised.
""The issue was human error and in breach of NAB's data security policies,"" Chief Data Officer Glenda Crisp said in a statement on NAB's website.
The data uploaded included customer names, their date of birth, contact details and in some cases, government identity numbers, the statement added.
""There is no evidence to indicate that any of the information has been copied or further disclosed,"" the lender said.
The data service companies told NAB that information they receive is deleted within two hours, it added.
The breach comes a week after NAB hired Ross McEwan, the man credited with turning around Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS), as its new chief executive officer, as it hopes to win back customer trust after damaging findings in a public inquiry into the financial sector.
NAB was among the worst hit of the ""Big Four"" lenders, after the inquiry specifically cited its CEO and Chairman for failing to accept responsibility for the wrongdoings.
Both individuals resigned days later.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 04:41AM ET</span>",Papua New Guinea's Air Niugini developing fleet replacement plan for its 25 planes,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea's Air Niugini is looking to replace its entire fleet of 25 planes in the coming years and has sought information from manufacturers and lessors about options before launching a formal tender, its managing director said on Friday.
""Everything is on the table at the moment,"" Managing Director Alan Milne, a former Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) executive who took on the role in November, told Reuters in a phone interview. ""The board has asked me to do what we can in the fleet simplification space.""
The airline in 2016 placed an order for four  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX jets that had been due to arrive in two batches in late 2020 and mid-2021 before the plane was grounded globally by regulators following a deadly crash in Ethiopia in March.
Two are meant to replace two 737 NG series planes in operation, but the need for the other two is unclear and they could be switched to Boeing widebodies or Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) regional jets once Boeing's deal to buy 80% of the Brazilian planemaker's commercial division closes, Milne said.
""The 767s, I think one of them is due back (to the lessor) in 2020 so I have got a decision to make,"" he said in reference to the airline's two widebodies. ""We can extend the lease. I don't want to.""
Embraer's E195-E2 jet visited Port Moresby this week as part of a global demonstration tour. Milne said it was a potential replacement for the airline's aging Fokker jets. The carrier's complex fleet also includes De Havilland Canada Dash-8 turboprops.
Air Niugini expects responses from lessors and manufacturers from its request for information soon and will later launch a more formal request for proposal, he said.
The airline in October lost one of its 737s when it crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, killing one passenger and seriously injuring 6 others.
The pilots disregarded 13 aural alerts as the plane came in to land, according to a report from the Papua New Guinea Accident Investigation Commission released last week.
The accident was caused by pilot error, according to the report, but it did not delve into why the pilots did not abort the landing.
Air Niugini is bringing in human-factors experts to examine relevant safety issues, Milne said, adding the pilots involved were not currently flying but remained employed at least until an investigation was completed.
""Was it a criminal act? No. Was it an intentional act? No. Was there gross negligence? That is what we've got to answer,"" he said. ""That is the bit that we are doing at the moment."""
1429,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 04:18AM ET</span>",French carmaker Renault cuts 2019 revenue outlook,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) warned revenue may decline this year, scrapping a previous goal, after first-half profit was hit by weakening car demand and an earnings collapse at alliance partner Nissan (T:7201) in the wake of the Carlos Ghosn scandal.
Net income slumped by more than half to 970 million euros ($1.08 billion) in January-June as revenue fell 6.4% to 28.05 billion, the French carmaker said on Friday. Operating profit also dropped 13.6% to 1.65 billion euros.
""Given the degradation in demand, the group now expects 2019 revenues to be close to last year's,"" Renault said - abandoning an earlier pledge to increase revenue before currency effects.
A broad-based auto sales downturn has rattled the sector, prompting profit warnings and compounding challenges for Renault and Nissan as they struggle to turn the page on the Ghosn era. Their former alliance boss is now awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies.
Renault's bottom line was hit by an 826 million-euro drop in earnings from its 43.4%-owned partner. Nissan is cutting 12,500 jobs globally after an earnings collapse that it is keen to blame on Ghosn's leadership.
But Renault's own performance - reflected in an operating margin that declined to 5.9% from 6.4% the year before - compares less favorably with domestic rival PSA Group (PA:PEUP). The  Peugeot  maker bucked the downturn with a record 8.7% profit margin unveiled on Wednesday.
Alliance tensions flared after Ghosn's November arrest, worsened when Renault tried in vain to merge with Nissan then  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), and may be affecting operational performance, investors fear.
Citi analyst Raghav Gupta-Chaudhary flagged a lower-than-usual 258 million euros in joint purchasing savings for Renault. ""We thought this would be weak in light of the well-documented difficulties with the alliance,"" he said.
Renault blamed falling sales in France, as well as Turkey and Argentina, for a 7.7% revenue drop at its core automotive business, whose profit margin slid to 4% from 4.5%.
Operating free cash flow also suffered, coming in at a negative 716 million euros as investment jumped by 742 million euros to 2.91 billion. 
Renault, which is counting on model launches including a new Clio mini to boost performance in the second half of 2019, nonetheless reiterated pledges to deliver positive full-year cash flow and a margin close to 6%.
Renault shares were down 0.5% at 52.02 euros as of 0800 GMT in Paris, after initially falling as much as 2.7%. The stock remains almost 19% below its level on the eve of Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest in Tokyo.

1430,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 03:48AM ET</span>",Billionaire Agarwal Walks Away From Anglo American Stake,"(Bloomberg) -- Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, once the biggest shareholder in   Anglo American   Plc (LON:AAL), plans to exit his stake in the diversified mining company.
  Volcan   Investments (OTC:VOHO)., Agarwal’s holding company, will unwind the position by calling an exchangeable bond, part of an unusual structure that effectively gave him the shares on loan. Cairn India Holdings, an offshore unit of Vedanta Ltd (NYSE:VEDL), said separately that it ended a structured investment in Anglo agreed with Volcan in December that netted a gain of about $100 million in the eight-month period it was held.
Agarwal will likely make about $500 million from his investment and pocket between $200 million and $300 million after fees, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. It’s a small gain considering Anglo shares had soared more than 80% since March 2017, when Agarwal announced his intentions. Anglo fell as much as 5.1% and traded 4.5% lower at 8:05 a.m. in London.
The future of Anglo American, one of the most iconic names in mining, has been in question ever since Agarwal built his surprise stake. Analysts have speculated about plans to break up or merge Anglo, which owns some of the best copper, diamond and platinum mines in the world. But the market moved against Agarwal, making any prospective plans more difficult.
The billionaire maintained that his interest in Anglo was a family investment and he didn’t intend to make a takeover offer. Even so, the structure used to hold the Anglo investment was unusual because it offered Agarwal voting rights and minimal exposure to the stock price.
Lacked Firepower
“As Anglo American’s share price climbed, it became even more clear that Agarwal lacked the firepower to work an approach,” said Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum Capital Markets. “He’s made far less than he would have done with a straight investment, though his bankers would have done well out of it.”
The biggest challenge Agarwal would have faced is the surge in Anglo’s share price since he bought his first tranche. His two listed ventures, Vedanta Ltd. and Hindustan Zinc Ltd., slumped over the same period making any kind of merger hard to execute. At the same time, presumed allies such as South Africa’s Public Investment Corp. looked less aligned.
Agarwal amassed his stake through a mandatory exchangeable bond issued by Volcan and secured by Anglo shares. The bonds were issued in March and September 2017 and financed the $3.5 billion pound ($4.4 billion) investment.
Volcan now plans to call the exchangeable bond, according to a statement released late Thursday, meaning investors who owned the Volcan bond will receive Anglo shares. The mining company could see higher trading volumes in the coming days as the new Anglo shareholders close out the short positions they used as a hedge, said RBC Capital Markets.
“The unwind of this structure will remove, in our view, any tangible potential for Volcan to pursue large-scale corporate activity with Anglo American going forward,” said Tyler Broda, an analyst at RBC. “We would not expect to see any fundamental derating in Anglo American on the back of this adventurous bond coming to an end.”
There were doubts on group sustainability, given debt levels at Volcan and Vedanta Resources Ltd., as well as doubts on whether a bid for Anglo would be mounted, ICICI Securities Ltd. analysts led by Abhijit Mitra said in a note on Friday. Volcan’s decision coincides with factors including Anglo’s share buyback and Chief Executive Officer Mark Cutifani indicating he won’t leave the company until completion of a copper project in Peru, the brokerage said.
Vedanta Resources’ $1 billion 6.125% note due 2024 rose the most since January on Friday, surging 2.2 cents on the dollar to 94.3 cents as of 1:55pm in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg-compiled prices. Vedanta Ltd. shares fell 2.8% in Mumbai ahead of the company’s earnings later in the day. Agarwal’s Volcan Investments is the parent of Vedanta Resources, which in turn owns the Mumbai-listed Vedanta Ltd."

ECB President Mario Draghi on Thursday all but pledged to ease policy further and even hinted at a reinterpretation of the ECB's inflation target, but this disappointed some investors who had hoped for an immediate easing of interest rates.
The pan-European stock benchmark index (STOXX) rose 0.1% by 0711 GMT.
The ECB disappointment stems from strongly dovish notes major central banks had struck last month that spurred a rally in stocks as investors hoped for policy easing as soon as the next meeting. Focus now shifts to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to cut rates by at least a quarter basis point next week.
Shares of Vivendi (PA:VIV) rose 4% after stellar first-half results at its Universal Music Group raised the stakes for the sale of the French media giant's most-prized asset.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - E-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc funded a ""holistic health education"" camp as part of efforts to market directly to school-aged children, members of a U.S. congressional panel said on Thursday, citing internal company documents.
Democrats on a subcommittee of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform released a cache of internal Juul emails and other documents that committee staff described as early attempts to ""enter schools and convey its messaging directly to teenage children."" 
Juul's use of social media influencers to promote its vaping devices in the years after it launched in 2015 also came under scrutiny.
James Monsees, Juul's co-founder and chief product officer, told the committee that the company's target audience from the beginning has been adult cigarette smokers.
Among efforts cited in the Juul documents released were a $134,000 payment to set up a five-week ""holistic health education"" summer camp at a Maryland charter school, recruiting children from third through 12th grades, and offering $10,000 to schools using the company's ""youth prevention and education"" programs for students, including those caught using e-cigarette products. 
""You don't think that sounds strange at all?"" Representative Katie Hill, a Democrat, asked Juul's chief administrative officer, Ashley Gould.
""All of these educational efforts were intended to keep youth from using the product,"" Gould responded. When Juul realized how the school involvement could be perceived as negative, ""we stopped the program,"" she said.
In a statement after the hearing, Juul said the $134,000 donation was to ""facilitate already-existing community outreach and youth-prevention programs,"" and said the company ""did not have any direct interaction with the students.""
Several committee members said Juul's initiatives appeared similar to past efforts by the tobacco industry to reach young people under the guise of smoking prevention programs. Gould said Juul, which is 35 percent owned by Marlboro maker  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO), halted its program last year once it became aware of the tobacco industry's past moves.
Caleb Mintz, 17, a New York city high school student, testified at a separate hearing on Wednesday that a Juul representative came to his school as part of an educational program on mental health and addiction last year. He said in an interview Thursday that students received ""mixed messages"" about the product, being told it was safe but not to buy it.
Mintz said after the hearing that the Juul presentation seemed to be ""playing to the side of teens as rebellious. When a teen is told not to do something, they're more likely to do it."" 
Members of the committee also quizzed Gould and Monsees over the use of social media influencers to promote Juul's vaping devices.
Company executives early on agreed that ""younger consumers age 25 to 34 was going to be the target of our initial campaign,"" Monsees said. ""They would be more receptive to new technology solutions,"" such as the Juul device.

Amid an enormous uptick in teenage use of e-cigarettes in 2018 -- a 78% increase among high school students from 2017 to 2018, according to federal data -- Juul said it ended all social media advertising last fall. Juul also pulled many flavored nicotine pods, except mint, menthol and tobacco, from retail stores, which Monsees said represented more than half of the company's sales at that time.

Wall Street shares fell from record highs on Thursday, with the S&P 500 (SPX) losing 0.53%, following a flurry of downbeat quarterly results from Ford Motor (N:F) and other companies. (N)
But several companies that announced results after the market had closed on Thursday generally beat expectations, and their shares rose in after-hours trade.
Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) jumped 7.9%,  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) 5.1% and Starbucks (O:SBUX) 6.6%. Amazon (O:AMZN), however, dipped 1.6% on its first profit miss in two years.
U.S. stock futures (ESc1) rose 0.23% in Asia.
""Some capital goods makers have reported soft earnings but otherwise U.S. earnings have been generally good, partly because investors had already lowered their expectations,"" said Hitoshi Asaoka, senior strategist at Asset Management One.
""Still, with U.S. share prices already at record levels, further gains are likely to be limited unless we see clearer signs of recovery in global demand,"" he said.
Uncertainties over whether Washington and Beijing will be able to settle gaping differences over trade, technology and even geopolitical ambitions, kept many investors on guard. Negotiators from the two sides will meet in Shanghai next week.
A rally in global bonds ran out of steam after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi cautioned about pulling the trigger too quickly on policy easing, even though he all but pledged to loosen monetary settings further as the growth outlook deteriorates.
Many market players had thought Draghi could cut rates on Thursday.
ECB officials told Reuters after the meeting that an interest rate cut in September appeared certain, while government bond purchases and a revamped policy message were also likely.
The euro's overnight index swaps are pricing in a cut of more than 10 basis points in September, to minus 0.50 percent.
""An interest rate cut of 10 basis points in September looks like a done deal now,"" said Hideki Kishida, fixed income strategist at Nomura Securities.
The 10-year German government bond yield (DE10YT=RR) initially hit a record low of minus 0.463 percent but ended the day up slightly at minus 0.407 percent.
While European bond yields are likely to stay under pressure until the next ECB meeting on Sept 12, Brexit could become a central issue as investors look to the stance of Britain's new government under Boris Johnson.
""If there are signs of easing tensions, we could see temporary rise in European bond yields,"" Nomura's Kishida said.
The U.S. 10-year Treasuries yield also rose 3 basis points to 2.079 percent (US10YT=RR) on Thursday and last traded at 2.107 percent.
Also helping to stem falls in bond yields, new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods surged in June, suggesting some improvement in business investment.
Despite that, investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage point at its policy meeting ending on July 31 to protect the economy from potential damage from the protracted U.S.-China trade war.
An advance reading of U.S. GDP, due at 8:30 a.m (1230 GMT), is expected to show the economy grew 1.8% in April-June, which would be the slowest growth in more than two years.

TORONTO (Reuters) - A new licensing process for legal cannabis producers in Canada limits the ability of smaller companies to attract investment, which could leave the fledgling industry dominated by companies with deep pockets or those who got a foot in the door prior to regulation changes in May, industry executives said. 
The changes came about after Health Canada, the federal health agency in charge of the licensing process, was swamped by applications for licensed producers, putting a strain on its resources and causing months of delays for applicants.
The agency has received over 800 applications for cannabis licenses since 2013. Of those, 457 passed the initial paper-based review, but 70% of them have yet to show evidence they have built a facility.
This backlog is ""contributing to wait times for more mature applications and an inefficient allocation of resources,"" Health Canada spokeswoman Tammy Jarbeau said.
The licensing process has come under increased scrutiny since  CannTrust  Holdings (TO:TRST) revealed this month they were being investigated by Health Canada for selling marijuana grown in unlicensed facilities.
Under its new system, Health Canada requires a new facility to be fully built before one can apply for a license, moving away from a process under which a company could apply for approval after meeting certain milestones.
Industry insiders said the new rules are making the market less accessible for smaller businesses.
""That pretty much put a lot of people out of the running of even applying anymore,"" Mathew Columbro, president and co-founder of Vindica Cannabis Corp, a strategic consulting firm for companies in the cannabis industry.
Under the prior system, companies would leverage milestones achieved in the application process to attract funding for the next steps, Columbro said.
STARTING SMALL
Now to even apply to some day sell cannabis products, a company must have a growing facility built without any guarantee it will receive the license that would make the facility legal and potentially profitable.
Columbro said it is not yet clear whether the changes will have an impact on supply.
Dentons Canada lawyer Eric Foster said several of his clients, as a direct result of the regulatory change, are now looking to build relatively small growing facilities of just a few thousand square feet. 
""This will help reduce the upfront capital costs and also speed up the licensing process as it will take less time to build a smaller facility than a larger one,"" Foster said.
Once their license is approved, the companies will be able to more easily raise additional capital for expansions and build out more, he said.
Industry analysts, lawyers and producers said the new system is not necessarily a bad thing as it will free up Health Canada time and resources for more serious applicants.
""It filters out those who can't get their affairs in order,"" Norton Singhavon, Chief Executive of GreenTec Holdings, said. ""The selfish part of me, I actually like that.""
GreenTec, which operates at all levels of the cannabis supply chain, is reaping the benefits of getting in the door prior to the regulatory change, Singhavon said.
The company has filed license extension applications for several small cannabis farms it recently acquired. With the new build-to-apply requirement, Singhavon said GreenTec is experiencing slightly faster turnaround times for its applications.
But Singhavon, whose company started in 2017, said GreenTec would not have survived without being able to attract investors as it achieved early milestones in the original licensing process, particularly when it was going public in 2018.

""Thank God this machine came in when it came in,"" he said.

(Reuters) - A California judge on Thursday reduced a $2 billion jury verdict, slashing the award for a couple who blamed Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup for their cancer to $86.7 million.
Superior Court Judge Winifred Smith of the California Superior Court in Oakland said the jury's billion-dollar punitive damages awards were excessive and unconstitutional, but rejected Bayer's request to strike the punitive award outright.
Under Smith's final order, California couple Alva and Alberta Pilliod would receive roughly $17 million in compensatory and $69 million in punitive damages, down from $55 million and $2 billion, respectively.
The plaintiffs still have to formally accept the reduced award.
Bayer in a statement on Thursday said Smith's decision to slash the award was a step in the right direction, but added it would file an appeal.
""We continue to believe that the verdict and damage awards are not supported by the evidence at trial and conflict with the extensive body of reliable science and conclusions of leading health regulators worldwide that confirms glyphosate-based herbicides can be used safely and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic,"" the company said.
Bayer faces Roundup cancer lawsuits by more than 13,400 plaintiffs across the United States. The Germany-based company bought Roundup maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in a $63 billion deal last year, but has since seen its share price tumble over the glyphosate litigation.
Plaintiffs allege Roundup causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and that Monsanto for decades tried to influence scientists and regulators to bury cancer evidence. Bayer denies those allegations.
The company had asked Smith to strike the punitive damages award in the Pilliods' case, arguing that hundreds of studies and assessments by regulators worldwide concluded the herbicide to be safe for human use.
But the judge in her Thursday order rejected those arguments.
""In this case there was clear and convincing evidence that Monsanto made efforts to impede, discourage, or distort scientific inquiry and the resulting science,"" Smith said.
Bayer to date has lost three U.S. jury trials in the Roundup litigation, with juries in California awarding multi-million dollar awards. It is appealing the decisions.

In August, the company is scheduled to face its first trial outside California at a courthouse in St. Louis, Missouri. Monsanto has recruited Missouri-based expert witnesses to make its case in a place where it has century-old roots but where juries often hit companies with huge damages.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 10:33PM ET</span>","Four automakers, California strike compromise on vehicle emissions","By David Shepardson and Ben Klayman
WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - Four major automakers said on Thursday they have reached an agreement with California on fuel efficiency rules, bypassing a Trump administration effort to strip the state of the right to fight climate change by setting its own standards.
California and other states had vowed to enforce stricter Obama-era emissions standards, after President Donald Trump proposed rolling back the federal rules. Automakers had worried that court battles between state and federal governments could create years of uncertainty for manufacturers.
Environmental groups had mixed reactions to the California compromise, which is voluntary for the automakers and not legally binding. The plan is more stringent than Trump's proposal but looser than the Obama-era rule. California, the most populous U.S. state, accounts for about 12% of U.S. vehicle sales, and if the administration recognizes the deal it would allow automakers to operate under one set of rules.
""Ensuring that America’s vehicles are efficient, safe and affordable is a priority for us all,""  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), BMW AG (DE:BMWG), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) said in a joint statement. They said the accord could help maintain a nationwide set of fuel efficiency requirements.
The automakers ""didn't want to face the expense, distraction and the bad publicity that comes from being part of a big rollback on clean cars,"" Mary Nichols, who chairs the California Air Resources Board, told Reuters on Wednesday.
She said the state hoped to turn the voluntary agreement ""into enforceable agreements"" and that the companies had agreed not to legally challenge California's vehicle regulatory authority.
The White House showed no willingness to reopen talks, saying ""the federal government, not a single state, should set this standard. We are moving forward to finalize a rule for the benefit of all Americans."" 
Environmental Protection Agency spokesman Michael Abboud called the agreement ""a PR stunt that does nothing to ... provide certainty and relief for American consumers.""
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) said in a statement it looked forward to reviewing the agreement, while General Motors Co (N:GM) said it still hoped for a nationwide deal. 
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers representing major automakers including GM, VW and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), said the deal acknowledged the Obama rules are ""not attainable and need to be adjusted.""
The Trump administration in August 2018 proposed revoking California's right to impose state emissions standards or require more electric vehicles. The administration argued that federal law preempts states from setting their own rules.
Under Trump, federal regulators backed freezing emissions requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026. The proposal by EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is not expected to go to the White House for final review for at least several more weeks, people briefed on the matter said.
Consumers broadly support prioritizing the environment. A Pew Research Center survey showed that a majority of U.S. adults (56%) say protecting the environment should be a top priority for the president and Congress.
However, fuel economy ranked only seventh on a recent Kelley Blue Book quarterly survey of the 12 most important factors for buyers of non-luxury vehicles, behind reliability, safety, affordability, comfort, performance and reputation. For luxury car buyers, it ranked tenth.
The Obama-era rules adopted in 2012 called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration’s preferred option.
California's compromise with the automakers would increase stringency of the requirements at a nationwide average annual rate of 3.7% starting in the 2022 model year through 2026, and 1% of that annual improvement could be covered by credits awarded for building electrified vehicles.
The deal extends credits for building electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel vehicles and also hikes the cap for winning credits for fuel efficiency improvements not captured by traditional testing. California agreed to remove a requirement to account for upstream emissions of fuels.
""A 50-state solution has always been our preferred path forward and we understand that any deal involves compromise,"" the automakers' statement said. They said the deal will let them ""meet both federal and state requirements with a single national fleet ... to ensure meaningful greenhouse gas emissions reductions.""
Nichols said the compromise would allow the White House to declare ""victory"" because it slowed down the pace of required fuel economy improvements. She added California is getting ""substantially the same results in terms of getting cleaner cars onto the road but it makes it happen a year later.""
Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, criticized the California deal, saying it could result in less than half the emissions reductions called for under the Obama rules. The Sierra Club said ""in the face of a total abdication of duties by the Trump administration, today’s announcement is a positive step forward.""
On June 6, 17 major automakers wrote a letter to Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom seeking to revive talks to avoid lengthy litigation. The White House rejected that effort and automakers and California launched private talks.
Automakers credited Trump with reopening the requirements after the Obama administration in its final weeks had sought to lock them in through 2025. In White House meetings, they have urged Trump officials to reach a deal.

Newsom said he expects additional companies to sign on to the agreement. A dozen U.S. states have adopted California's vehicle emissions rules covering more than a third of U.S. sales.

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) attracted more customers in the latest quarter on an expanded line up of beverages and food offerings in the United States and China, leading the coffee chain to raise its fiscal 2019 profit forecast.
Shares of the company rose nearly 6% to $96.40 after the bell and were on track to hit a record high, after the world's largest coffee chain posted its biggest same-store sales growth in three years.
Starbucks has been trying to make its menu more appealing by adding new beverages such as the Dragon drink and Cocoa Cloud Macchiato, while also expanding the delivery side of its business with new partnerships.
The added food options and Nitro Cold brew, a rich coffee that has a foamy texture like beer, lured more customers to stores during lunch hours, which is typically the slowest time of the day, the company said. 
Those efforts led to a 3% growth in traffic in the second quarter.
""(Traffic is) an area where Starbucks has struggled,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ""A lot of investors were asking: 'When are you going to see a traffic increase?' ... This is a nice quarter on that standpoint.""
The in-store traffic trend was encouraging as Starbucks and other restaurants had been raising prices to buffer bottom lines as more customers increasingly use mobile apps to order food and beverages.
The company has also been investing heavily in China by opening new stores and expanding delivery to cater to increased demand for on-the-go coffee.
Same-store sales rose 5% in China and the Asia-Pacific region, beating analysts' estimates of a 3.45% growth, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In Americas, same-store sales surged 7%, above estimates of a 4.43% gain.
The company is now expecting same-store sales near the top end of its fiscal 2019 forecast of 3% to 4% growth and raised its earnings forecast to between $2.80 and $2.82 per share.
Total net revenue for the third quarter rose 8.1% to $6.82 billion. The company earned 78 cents per share. 

Analysts had forecast a profit of 72 cents per share and revenue of $6.68 billion.

Slowing economic growth, low inflation, trade tensions and an environment in which $14 trillion of bonds carry negative yields have complicated decision-making for investors.
They have been forced to question fundamental theories seeing stocks as unequivocal beneficiaries of growth and bonds as havens in times of economic stress.
For funds that manage money across bonds, stocks and alternative assets, a barbell strategy can help balance risk, whether the global economy recovers or tips into recession.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Alan Ruskin, in a Wednesday note, said ""two seemingly contradictory themes"" - long carry trades and extreme risk aversion as interest rates fall - can form part of the same portfolio.
Ruskin's ""barbell"" idea entails short-term long positions on emerging market currencies such as Mexican peso , Indian rupee and Brazilian real and long-term holdings in gold and well-rated government bonds for safety.
For Hou Wey Fook, DBS chief investment officer in Singapore, a barbell approach involves ""outsized exposures"" in two areas – income-generating assets and non-cyclical investments such as technology and e-commerce.
SHOPPING LIST
Included on Hou's shopping list: U.S. tech services firms that are less vulnerable to trade tensions than hardware and consumer electronics; real estate investment trusts offering an attractive and predictable income stream; slightly lower rated investment grade corporate bonds; and Chinese equities.
Kerry Craig, Melbourne-based global strategist for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management has low-risk government bonds at one end of his fixed income barbell and high-yielding or junk bonds on the other.
In adjusting strategy, Craig and others are wrestling with the uncertainty and big headwind the protracted Sino-U.S. trade war has brought.
""The question from here is what happens next?"" said Peter Wilmshurst, a portfolio manager for Franklin Templeton Investments who is pursuing a barbell strategy on a A$320 million ($225 million) equities portfolio.
""Does the trade war continue to recede or does it go hot again? Do we see U.S.-Iranian conflict go more severe which could change expectations for oil prices, inflation and interest rates? And then, where does economic growth go?""
A barbell strategy helps investors avoid overexposure to the binary outcomes from each scenario that could make or break portfolios.

REAL RETURNS
In the current environment, the safe end of the barbell in which bulk of investment resides is in money market funds, highly-rated sovereign bonds and gold. Part of the mountain of negative-yielding developed market debt is also in numerous barbell strategies, showing investors are prepared to pay for the safety and liquidity of some assets.
Risky bets include low-rated corporate bonds and emerging market assets, including equities.
This year, global stocks (MIWD00000PUS) are up nearly 17% with S&P 500 (SPX) and the Nasdaq (IXIC) are around record highs while bond yields are near all-time lows. Gold reached a six-year peak recently while U.S. oil futures (CLc1) had a wild ride in 2018's last quarter, ranging from $76.90 to $42.36 a barrel.
Investors including Templeton's Wilmshurst are wagering on bond-proxies or instruments that provide fixed income, such as infrastructure stocks with revenues largely immune to downturns and real estate investment trusts (REITs).
At the risky end of his barbell, Wilmshurst is advocating exposure to banks he feels reward investors well, such as  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN).
""Financials should be a significant part of your portfolio,"" he said. ""If we do see some recovery in economic momentum they'll be re-rated significantly, and if you don't you're still getting pretty attractive returns"" from dividends and share buybacks.
Australia's A$154 billion sovereign wealth fund recently kicked off a program to sell portions of its private equity and infrastructure investments, to be in more liquid assets.
""Very rarely would we make moves in the portfolio with a view over a shorter timeframe and now is actually one of those times,"" Future Fund chief investment officer Raphael Arndt told Reuters.

1448,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 06:08PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here are the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Amazon Slips, but Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Intel Shine
Today’s big postmarket earnings should help the market tomorrow, although Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) seeing red in after-hours trading could be a hindrance.
Amazon’s earnings missed expectations as operating expenses jumped and the company also warned on third-quarter operating income.
But Google parent Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares jumped sharply following a quarterly report that beat on the top and bottom lines.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) should help the chip sector tomorrow as it climbed on the back of solid numbers, fuelled by demand for its data center chips and high-performance products.
And Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) also impressed investors, with comparable-store sales beating forecasts.
2. U.S. Economy Expected to Show Signs of Slowing 
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will report its preliminary reading on second-quarter GDP at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT) tomorrow.
Economists, on average, expect the economy slowed to a pace of 1.8% in the second quarter from the 3.1% rate seen in the previous quarter.
But some analysts appear more optimistic on the pace of economic growth.
""We forecast GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% in 2Q19, led by strong contributions from consumer spending and government expenditures (see 2Q19 GDP Forecast). In part, historical data that is about to be revised contribute to this forecast,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note.
While GDP will rightfully take the spotlight, consumer confidence will also get at least a cursory look.
The University of Michigan releases its preliminary measure of July consumer sentiment at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Consumer sentiment is expected to tick up slightly to 98.8, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
3. Twitter Readies Earnings 
The tech earnings parade continues Friday, with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) set to release second-quarter earnings before markets open.
Twitter is expected to report a profit of 18 cents per share, according to Investing.com, on revenue of $829 million.
As well as its earnings and guidance, average monetizable daily active users (mDAU) will be one of the closely watched metrics after the company reported an 11% rise to 134 million in the first quarter.
The social media company's report comes against a mixed backdrop for social media companies as user growth has been steady, but the threat of regulatory scrutiny is on the rise.
Dow component McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and consumer products giant Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) also weigh in before the bell."
1449,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 06:07PM ET</span>",Philip Morris launches first Africa store to spark alternative cigarettes demand,"By Nqobile Dludla
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The South African unit of cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc (N:PM) opened its first flagship store in Johannesburg on Thursday, as it tries to grow demand in Africa for its alternative heated tobacco product IQOS.
The store in Sandton gives Philip Morris access to tourists and business people from Africa who frequent Africa's richest square mile, allowing it to use its retail footprint as a springboard to expand in the rest of the continent.
""If you look at Sandton, it's the business hub of South Africa and Africa as well so it's the one place where we need to start with our permanent flagship store,"" Philip Morris South Africa Managing Director Marcelo Nico told Reuters at the sidelines of the launch.
South Africa is the first and only market in Africa where Philip Morris sells IQOS, an acronym for ""I quit ordinary smoking,"" which the company says contains up to 95% fewer toxic compounds than regular cigarettes.
""We are bringing the first experience of commercializing this technology on the African continent and the objective is, based on this experience over time, roll it out in the rest of the continent,"" Nico said.
Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, launched a pilot store in Cape Town in late 2017, which operated for about a year, to test the market's appetite, Nico said. Over time it plans to return to Cape Town with a permanent store.
The firm began selling IQOS in 2017 in South Africa with the affordable 2.4 model and later launched the IQOS 3 and MULTI in November last year.
Unlike traditional smoked cigarettes, IQOS devices electronically heat tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper just enough to generate an aerosol that contains nicotine. They are different from e-cigarettes such as the popular Juul device, which vaporizes a nicotine-filled liquid.
The 160 square meter (1,722 square foot) store's interior is minimalistic with lounge couches, bright lighting and an information section, where consumers are shown the different effects of burnt cigarettes and IQOS through a machine that emits a white cloudy smoke for IQOS and brownish smoke for normal cigarettes.
Consumers can also hold their phones up to the large picture displays in the store in order to get detailed information, demonstrations and videos about the product.
An estimated 70% of South African adults who have switched to the product since the launch have converted fully to IQOS, the company said in 2018.
One such adult is 33-year-old Evans Manyonga, who started using IQOS two years ago because he was ""coughing a lot"" from cigarettes and has since converted two of his friends.
""I don't smell of cigarettes. I don't cough. It's smoother and classier,"" Manyonga, who has been smoking for 10 years, told Reuters at the store's opening.

Neil Borthwick, who was trying IQOS for the first time at the launch, said, ""you can smoke it anywhere without smoke or ash and it gives you that same satisfaction that you have with a normal cigarette.""

1450,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 05:27PM ET</span>",Investors book profits from U.S.-based equity funds ahead of Fed meeting,"By Jennifer Ablan
(Reuters) - U.S.-based equity funds posted more than $8.4 billion of cash withdrawals in the week ended Wednesday, following two weeks of inflows, according to Refinitiv's Lipper.
The withdrawals came ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting. In the same week, U.S.-based money-market funds attracted $26 billion, their fifth consecutive week of inflows, Lipper said.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates next week to bolster the U.S. economy, even as the U.S. unemployment rate sits at its lowest in 50 years. Broad expectations that the Fed would cut rates to counter the impact of a protracted trade war have helped Wall Street's main indexes scale record levels this month.
""Despite plus-side equity returns, both fund investors and ETF investors were net redeemers of equity assets, redeeming a net $8.4 billion for the week,"" said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Lipper.
""Shrugging off progress in the U.S.-China trade talks, a nice start to the Q2 earnings season, and general agreement on the U.S. budget and ceiling, investors showed constraint after learning that Iran had seized a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, increasing geopolitical concerns.""
Roseen said investors moved money from equities to bonds. ""Both fund and ETF investors padded the coffers of taxable and tax-exempt bond funds, investing net new money in longer-dated issues,"" he said.
U.S.-based municipal bond funds attracted $1.96 billion of net new cash, the group's largest weekly net inflows on record going back to 1992, Lipper said. U.S.-based investment-grade corporate bond funds attracted about $2.5 billion in the week ended Wednesday, their eighth consecutive week of inflows, according to Lipper data. At the lower-end of the credit-quality spectrum, U.S.-based high-yield junk bond funds attracted more than $1.3 billion in the week ended Wednesday, their seventh straight week of inflows, Lipper said.
For the fifth week running, investors were net purchasers of money market funds, injecting $26 billion into this safe-haven asset class, Roseen added."

The toymaker also achieved its full-year cost savings target six months ahead of schedule and posted a much smaller loss, as the company benefits from making toys modeled on big Hollywood titles and revitalizing the 60-year-old Barbie brand with variants based on popular celebrities and role models.
Worldwide sales in the action figures, building sets and games segment jumped over 20% in the second quarter, while they rose about 9% in the Barbie unit.
""Toy Story 4"" circles around a group of toys, voiced by Hollywood A-listers Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, has made over $860 million worldwide.

""Historically, it wasn't an area we were focused on but going forward we are looking to do more. The success of 'Toy Story' is an example of our capabilities,"" he said.
Mattel's rival  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) earlier this week also beat quarterly profit and sales estimates on demand for action toys based on ""Avengers: Endgame"", reflecting the toy industry's shift away from developing new original properties to chasing big entertainment titles to grab kids' attention.

The company said its results were boosted by strong sales performances for chips used in data centers and growing demand for higher performance products used in personal computers and related devices. Revenue for its Client Computing Group (basically chips for PCs) was up 1.3% to $8.84 billion, better than the FactSet estimate of $8.13 billion. Its higher-profit Data Center business saw a 10% revenue decline to $4.98 billion, but that also beat the FactSet estimate.
Separately, Intel said it was selling a majority of its smartphone modem business to Apple for about $1 billion. About 2,200 employees will become Apple employees.

OSHKOSH, Wisc. (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration distanced itself on Thursday from suggestions by Boeing (N:BA) that its grounded 737 MAX could resume flying passengers in October, saying regulators do not have a timeline for vetting safety upgrades.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told analysts on Wednesday he was confident the MAX would be back in service as early as October after a certification flight with regulators in September.
But the FAA's top official declined to be pinned down on Boeing's target of October or any other timeline for clearing the plane, which was grounded in March after two fatal crashes.
""We don't have a timeline. Don't have October. Don't have August. Don't have 2021,"" Acting Administrator Dan Elwell told reporters at the EAA AirVenture air show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
""We have one criteria. When the 737 MAX has been - when the complications to it have been satisfactorily assessed, and the MAX is safe to return to service, that's the only criteria,"" Elwell said.
Boeing has stressed that the decision to let the MAX fly again commercially would be made by regulators.
The MAX's return has been delayed as Chicago-based Boeing works to win approval for reprogrammed stall-prevention software and related training materials required in the wake of the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that together killed 346 people in the span of five months.
U.S. airlines are cancelling thousands of monthly flights due to the grounding and have warned of an increasing financial toll in the second half of the year. Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), a top customer, said on Thursday it was scheduling without the MAX until early January and ending operations at Newark Liberty International airport due to a scarcity of planes.
NEW FLAWS, LONG DELAYS
In late June, the FAA said it had identified a new risk as an agency pilot was running a flight simulator test seeking to intentionally activate the so-called MCAS stall-prevention system. During one activation, it took an extended period to recover the stabilizer trim system that is used to control the aircraft.
Boeing has said it is working on a fix to address the problem.
The European Aviation Safety Agency has handed the FAA and Boeing a list of its own concerns that it wants addressed before the MAX re-enters service, people familiar with the matter said.
It includes the behavior of the autopilot - which EASA believes may take the aircraft too close to a stall before automatically cutting out - as well as the physical force needed by pilots to move a backup wheel that is part of the trim system and extra training to help crew cope with simultaneous alarms.
Muilenburg said on Wednesday that all submissions by foreign regulators had been incorporated into Boeing's assessment that the aircraft could re-enter service as early as October.
He warned however that Boeing could have to further cut or even halt 737 production - currently still running at 80 percent of previous output rates in order to avoid disruption to parts production - if its forecasts prove to be too optimistic.
That warning and a record quarterly loss weighed on Boeing shares on Wednesday and at mid-session on Thursday they were down another 3.4% to $349.06."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Gazprom (MM:GAZP), the world's largest conventional gas producer, has received bids worth $3.15 billion for 3 percent of its own shares that it decided to sell after the stock hit its highest level in more than a decade.
Gazprom said on Thursday it had received 494 bids that altogether reached 198.89 billion roubles ($3.15 billion) for 2.92% of its own shares.
The stake is worth $2.3 billion, based on Wednesday's closing price and is part of a wider 6.6% stake known as treasury shares that Gazprom holds in itself.
Earlier on Thursday, the Moscow Exchange said that Gazprom subsidiaries Gazprom Gerosgaz Holdings BV and Rosingaz Limited will offer a combined stake of 693.6 million ordinary Gazprom shares to be sold during the day in one lot.
Gazprom shares were up by 4.5% at 1527 GMT, outperforming the overall market (IMOEX) which was 0.6% up.
Earlier this year, Gazprom, controlled by the Russian state, replaced key executives and promised to boost its dividend payout to 50% of net profits, spurring a rally in its shares to their highest since mid-2008.
Dmitry Marinchenko, an analyst with Fitch, said that the current Gazprom stock environment, partially boosted by the proposed changes in the dividend policy, supported the company's decision to sell part of its treasury shares.
But Vladislav Silayev, a trader with Alfa Capital, said that Gazprom's share sale could be a signal that the rally might now run out of steam.
""The sale usually happens when the seller is happy with the price. Looks like that the seller thinks that the (share price) growth potential is limited,"" Silayev said.
Gazprom's market value is $79.4 billion, second in Russia to Sberbank's $82 billion, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
Gazprom Chief Executive Alexei Miller told the company's shareholders last month that high-level management changes would continue to improve the way Gazprom operates across its businesses.
Ronald Smith, an analyst with Citibank in Moscow, said that since late 2018, six of a total 15 management board members have been replaced.
""While the long-term impact of those efforts to improve efficiency remain to be seen, even in isolation the dividend policy change is profoundly important, something that may well mark a turning point in the company’s history from the point of view of investors,"" Smith said in a July 9th report.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer watchdog on Thursday said it had fined a group of New York-based debt-collection firms and their two owners more than $60 million to settle claims they inflated consumer debts and broke the law when attempting to collect the money. 
The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) also said it had permanently barred the group of companies and their owners from acting as debt collectors, in a joint consent order with the New York Attorney General's office.
Thursday's order alleges that since at least 2009, the companies ""purchased millions of dollars’ worth of consumer debt, inflated those consumer debts, and relied on illegal tactics to extract as much money as possible from consumers for their debts,"" the regulator said.
The settlement with Northern Resolution Group, LLC, Enhanced Acquisitions, LLC, and Delray Capital, LLC and their owners Douglas MacKinnon and Mark Gray, resolves a lawsuit filed by the CFPB and the New York Attorney General's office in 2016. 
MacKinnon and Gray did not admit or deny the allegations. 
MacKinnon as well as Northern Resolution Group, LLC, and Enhanced Acquisitions, LLC, agreed to pay $40 million in redress to consumers and a combined $20 million penalty to both the CFPB and the office of the New York Attorney General, the consent order said.
Gray and Delray Capital, LLC agreed to pay $4 million in redress and a combined $2 million penalty to the CFPB and the New York Attorney General's office.
However, full payment of those amounts would be suspended subject to the defendants paying a $1 civil money penalty to the CFPB and $10,000 for consumer redress, the CFPB said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Thursday urged Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) shareholders to ask management to let them weigh in on board and governance issues as the company buys rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).. 
The request comes one week after the takeover deal's biggest critic, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, laid out plans to shake up Occidental's board.
ISS issued a research note on Thursday recommending that shareholders provide consent for the request to fix a record date, which would determine which shareholders would be able to have a say on possibly electing dissident directors.
The note, written by Cristiano Guerra, who heads ISS's Special Situations Research Group, also says ISS is not backing Icahn's nominees or planned changes.
Occidental said it disagreed with ISS’s recommendation that shareholders should take the first step and request the fixing of a Record Date for the consent solicitation and only later focus on whether the Icahn Group’s proposals would harm or further shareholder interests.
""The Board of Directors has unanimously determined that fixing a Record Date for the Icahn Group’s planned consent solicitation and the proposals the Icahn Group intends to ask shareholders to act on are NOT in the best interests of Occidental or our shareholders,"" the company said in a statement.
Shareholders were prevented from commenting on the company's ""transformational and controversial transaction"" with Anadarko, the ISS note said, and should be given a voice on such issues before next year's annual general meeting. ""There seems to be sufficient reason to address these concerns now, rather than waiting until the 2020 AGM.""
A week ago Icahn, a who owns 4.4% of Occidental and has become the most vocal critic of the $38 billion takeover of Anadarko, filed a solicitation statement with U.S. regulators. He wants to replace four board members with two of his employees and two executives who have financial and oil industry expertise.
Icahn has criticized Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub for the company's financial record and for seeking outside financing for the deal from billionaire investor Warren Buffett that did not require shareholder approval. 
In order to provide consent, Occidental's investors, including mutual fund firm T. Rowe Price among others, must provide a Record Date Request Form and answer a questionnaire that includes their trading history in Occidental stock. They also must instruct their Depository Trust Company to take actions on their behalf. 

Because shareholders cannot vote on this transaction, ""along with the self-evident complexity of the consent solicitation process, suggests that a more open and thorough debate regarding Occidental's strategic direction and overall governance would be beneficial,"" the ISS note said.

PayPal said it expected full-year revenue of between $17.6 billion and $17.8 billion, well below Wall Street’s estimates of $17.92 billion, sending PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) more than 4% lower. Despite the tumble, the shares are up 38% for the year.
The downbeat outlook arrived as the company reported mixed earnings, with beat on the bottom line but a miss on the top line.
PayPal reported earnings of 86 cents share, above estimates of 69 cents in its fiscal-third quarter, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. But revenue of $4.31 billion missed estimates of $4.33 billion.
The weaker guidance, however, appears to have done little damage to PayPal's growth narrative, with some on Wall Street convinced that it is too early to cash in on the stock.
Wedbush maintained its outperform rating on PayPal and a $140 price target on the stock blaming the revenue miss on delays in both revenue contributions from pending partnerships and in price increases. That compares with the consensus 12-month target of $120.24 of analysts tracked by Investing.com.
The brokerage also pointed to the payment company's strong fundamentals seen in the quarter, with total payment volume rising 24% to $172 billion. Active accounts and customer engagement also rose in the quarter.
""The bottom line, the combination of quarterly metrics strength (plus) the benefits of pending strategic partnerships continue to point to a powerful monetization phase at PayPal,"" Wedbush said.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 02:19PM ET</span>",American Airlines annual profit to take $400 million hit from MAX cancellations,"By Tracy Rucinski and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) top two U.S. customers warned on Thursday of an increasing financial toll from the prolonged grounding of the 737 MAX jet, which prompted a ""frustated"" Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) to announce it was ending operations at Newark Liberty International airport.
""It's really all about the MAX. It's the only thing we're dealing with,"" Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly told investors after taking a $175 million hit to operating income in the second quarter from the MAX grounding. 
""Everything else is rock solid,"" Kelly said, pointing to rising revenues and cost management, excluding costs related to roughly 150 daily flight cancellations as the airline manages its operations with a slimmer fleet.
Those costs are set to rise in the second half of the year, the airline said.
Southwest and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) are the two largest U.S. MAX operators, with 34 and 24 jets respectively and dozens more on order. Carriers that rushed to buy Boeing's fuel-efficient jets to open new and longer routes have been reeling from a global grounding in March that followed two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
American, the No. 1 U.S. airline, said it expected the grounding to hit its 2019 pre-tax earnings by about $400 million, about $50 million more than it had previously forecast.
The timing of the MAX's return to service is still uncertain.
The acting administrator for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which must approve Boeing's software fixes and new pilot training before the MAX can fly again, said on Thursday the timeline would be driven by one criteria: safety.
Based on guidance from Boeing, Southwest extended MAX-related cancellations until Jan. 5, 2020, saying it will need one to two months following regulatory approval to train pilots and prepare the jets for fresh commercial service.
It had previously removed the MAX jets from its flying schedule through early November, a timeline that American maintained on Thursday, despite skepticism by analysts.
Shares in American were down about 4.7% on Thursday while Southwest gained 1.6%, recovering from opening losses.
SCRAMBLING TO GROW
Lacking planes, Southwest said it was freezing new pilot hires and upgrades and ceasing service from underperforming Newark, where it had up to 20 daily departures, to consolidate its New York City service at nearby LaGuardia in early November.
However, the airline is resuming its growth plans in California and Hawaii next month, Kelly said. The airline cannot afford competitively to wait any longer, he said.
The low-cost carrier launched Hawaii flights this year. To help service that expansion, it is delaying the retirement of seven 737-700 aircraft.
Still, Southwest said its flying capacity will now fall by as much as 2% this year, a reversal from its earlier forecast of 5% growth. American's capacity will still grow in 2019, the airline said, but at a slower rate than originally planned.
Both Southwest and American said they have held discussions with Boeing about MAX-related damages but have not reached any conclusions.
Boeing, which posted its largest-ever quarterly loss on Wednesday and warned it may have to halt 737 MAX production, has taken a $4.9 billion charge linked to customer compensation. 
FEWER SEATS, HIGHER REVENUES
With fewer planes flying in a strong domestic air travel market, airlines have been able to charge more for seats, leading to stronger rises in unit revenues, based on per available seat mile, for American and Southwest as well as its main rivals.
That trend is expected to continue into the third quarter
American's total operating revenue rose 3% to $11.96 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, while Southwest's grew 2.9% to $5.9 billion, a quarterly record for both.
American said it was extending the lifespan of some of its other 737 models as well as some 757s and A320s. But aside from MAX woes, American is also dealing with about a dozen daily cancellations it attributes to work slowdowns by its two main mechanics unions, which need new contracts.

The unions have denied an intentional slowdown and the issue is being disputed in court, though American Chief Executive Doug Parker said he was determined to get a labor contract in place.

Agarwal began buying into Anglo American through a JP Morgan mandatory convertible bond in March 2017 and announced he was buying a second tranche in September 2017, taking his holding in the mining group to a total of 19.3%.
He would have had to make a decision next year on whether to buy the shares or seek to roll over the arrangement, which is effectively a loan.
On Thursday, Agarwal said in a statement the targeted returns had been achieved ""even sooner than expected"" and Anglo American's share price had nearly doubled since he began his investment.
He said he had encouraged Anglo to refocus on its South African operations and to position its business for ""the many opportunities available in the rapidly growing Indian market"".
Anglo American on Thursday declined to comment.
Earlier in the day it announced its strongest first-half earnings since 2011 and a $1 billion share buyback, its first since 2008.
The bonds issued in 2017 financed a 3.5 billion pound ($1.25 billion) investment by Volcan, Agarwal's family trust.
After paying back the loan, Agarwal is left with a 1.9% stake in Anglo, which he is selling on the open market, industry sources said.
Agarwal, who is chairman of Vedanta (NS:VDAN), has always said the stake was an investment, based on his belief in Anglo as a company, for his family trust. He said it was unrelated to Vedanta and he was not planning a takeover bid."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY), which is set to buy biotechnology company  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG) for $74 billion, posted better-than-expected second-quarter profit on Thursday on strong sales of blood thinner Eliquis and rheumatoid arthritis treatment Orencia.
Shares of the New York-based drugmaker were up 4.8% at $45.30 in afternoon trading.
The earnings follow mixed results released on Wednesday from a closely watched lung cancer trial of its blockbuster immunotherapy Opdivo in combination with either chemotherapy or its other immuno-oncology drug, Yervoy.
""While some of the drug data was disappointing, there was enough positivity for the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy that would suggest there is potential for that to gain share for a longer period of time,"" said Jeremy Bryan, portfolio manager at Gradient Investments.
Sales of Eliquis, which Bristol-Myers shares with  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), rose 24% to $2.04 billion, while Orencia sales rose 9% to $778 million, both exceeding Wall Street expectations.
Opdivo sales rose 12% to $1.82 billion.
Despite the solid growth for Opdivo, there has been widespread investor concern over the dominance of rival drug Keytruda from Merck & Co (N:MRK) in the lucrative lung cancer market. Keytruda has surpassed Opdivo in sales in recent quarters and the company said it expects additional pressure on Opdivo sales next year.
The latest lung cancer data is unlikely to allay those concerns. 
Opdivo combined with chemotherapy failed to extend overall survival more than chemotherapy alone as an initial treatment for advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Keytruda plus chemotherapy has demonstrated a survival benefit in clinical trials.
Opdivo did extend overall survival when used with Yervoy in certain NSCLC patients.
Some analysts and investors have suggested that one reason Bristol launched its bid for Celgene was over concerns about Opdivo losing ground to Keytruda.
Bristol said it still expects the Celgene deal to close in late 2019 or early 2020.
Excluding one-time items, the drugmaker said it earned $1.18 a share for the quarter, beating analysts' expectations by 11 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Bristol-Myers increased its full-year profit forecast by 10 cents and now expects to earn $4.20 to $4.30 a share. 
Revenue in the quarter was $6.27 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $6.11 billion.

The company reported a net profit of $1.43 billion, or 87 cents a share, compared with $373 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 02:27PM ET</span>",ISS urges Occidental shareholders to provide consent to fix record date,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Thursday urged Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) shareholders to ask management to let them weigh in on board and governance issues as the company buys rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).. 
The request comes one week after the takeover deal's biggest critic, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, laid out plans to shake up Occidental's board.
ISS issued a research note on Thursday recommending that shareholders provide consent for the request to fix a record date, which would determine which shareholders would be able to have a say on possibly electing dissident directors.
The note, written by Cristiano Guerra, who heads ISS's Special Situations Research Group, also says ISS is not backing Icahn's nominees or planned changes.
Occidental said it disagreed with ISS’s recommendation that shareholders should take the first step and request the fixing of a Record Date for the consent solicitation and only later focus on whether the Icahn Group’s proposals would harm or further shareholder interests.
""The Board of Directors has unanimously determined that fixing a Record Date for the Icahn Group’s planned consent solicitation and the proposals the Icahn Group intends to ask shareholders to act on are NOT in the best interests of Occidental or our shareholders,"" the company said in a statement.
Shareholders were prevented from commenting on the company's ""transformational and controversial transaction"" with Anadarko, the ISS note said, and should be given a voice on such issues before next year's annual general meeting. ""There seems to be sufficient reason to address these concerns now, rather than waiting until the 2020 AGM.""
A week ago Icahn, a who owns 4.4% of Occidental and has become the most vocal critic of the $38 billion takeover of Anadarko, filed a solicitation statement with U.S. regulators. He wants to replace four board members with two of his employees and two executives who have financial and oil industry expertise.
Icahn has criticized Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub for the company's financial record and for seeking outside financing for the deal from billionaire investor Warren Buffett that did not require shareholder approval. 
In order to provide consent, Occidental's investors, including mutual fund firm T. Rowe Price among others, must provide a Record Date Request Form and answer a questionnaire that includes their trading history in Occidental stock. They also must instruct their Depository Trust Company to take actions on their behalf. 

Because shareholders cannot vote on this transaction, ""along with the self-evident complexity of the consent solicitation process, suggests that a more open and thorough debate regarding Occidental's strategic direction and overall governance would be beneficial,"" the ISS note said.

PayPal said it expected full-year revenue of between $17.6 billion and $17.8 billion, well below Wall Street’s estimates of $17.92 billion, sending PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) more than 4% lower. Despite the tumble, the shares are up 38% for the year.
The downbeat outlook arrived as the company reported mixed earnings, with beat on the bottom line but a miss on the top line.
PayPal reported earnings of 86 cents share, above estimates of 69 cents in its fiscal-third quarter, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. But revenue of $4.31 billion missed estimates of $4.33 billion.
The weaker guidance, however, appears to have done little damage to PayPal's growth narrative, with some on Wall Street convinced that it is too early to cash in on the stock.
Wedbush maintained its outperform rating on PayPal and a $140 price target on the stock blaming the revenue miss on delays in both revenue contributions from pending partnerships and in price increases. That compares with the consensus 12-month target of $120.24 of analysts tracked by Investing.com.
The brokerage also pointed to the payment company's strong fundamentals seen in the quarter, with total payment volume rising 24% to $172 billion. Active accounts and customer engagement also rose in the quarter.
""The bottom line, the combination of quarterly metrics strength (plus) the benefits of pending strategic partnerships continue to point to a powerful monetization phase at PayPal,"" Wedbush said.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), meanwhile, raised its price target on Paypal to $129 from $114, on expectations that offline could represent a valuable growth driver for the company.
""(O)ur new US Digital Wallet model and AlphaWise survey show consumers’ desire to make PayPal usage 'omni-channel,'"" Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.

""Offline could be an incremental driver, providing a higher rate of compounding earnings per share growth, while competition remains more imagined than real,"" it said."
1482,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 02:19PM ET</span>",American Airlines annual profit to take $400 million hit from MAX cancellations,"By Tracy Rucinski and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) top two U.S. customers warned on Thursday of an increasing financial toll from the prolonged grounding of the 737 MAX jet, which prompted a ""frustated"" Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) to announce it was ending operations at Newark Liberty International airport.
""It's really all about the MAX. It's the only thing we're dealing with,"" Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly told investors after taking a $175 million hit to operating income in the second quarter from the MAX grounding. 
""Everything else is rock solid,"" Kelly said, pointing to rising revenues and cost management, excluding costs related to roughly 150 daily flight cancellations as the airline manages its operations with a slimmer fleet.
Those costs are set to rise in the second half of the year, the airline said.
Southwest and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) are the two largest U.S. MAX operators, with 34 and 24 jets respectively and dozens more on order. Carriers that rushed to buy Boeing's fuel-efficient jets to open new and longer routes have been reeling from a global grounding in March that followed two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
American, the No. 1 U.S. airline, said it expected the grounding to hit its 2019 pre-tax earnings by about $400 million, about $50 million more than it had previously forecast.
The timing of the MAX's return to service is still uncertain.
The acting administrator for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which must approve Boeing's software fixes and new pilot training before the MAX can fly again, said on Thursday the timeline would be driven by one criteria: safety.
Based on guidance from Boeing, Southwest extended MAX-related cancellations until Jan. 5, 2020, saying it will need one to two months following regulatory approval to train pilots and prepare the jets for fresh commercial service.
It had previously removed the MAX jets from its flying schedule through early November, a timeline that American maintained on Thursday, despite skepticism by analysts.
Shares in American were down about 4.7% on Thursday while Southwest gained 1.6%, recovering from opening losses.
SCRAMBLING TO GROW
Lacking planes, Southwest said it was freezing new pilot hires and upgrades and ceasing service from underperforming Newark, where it had up to 20 daily departures, to consolidate its New York City service at nearby LaGuardia in early November.
However, the airline is resuming its growth plans in California and Hawaii next month, Kelly said. The airline cannot afford competitively to wait any longer, he said.
The low-cost carrier launched Hawaii flights this year. To help service that expansion, it is delaying the retirement of seven 737-700 aircraft.
Still, Southwest said its flying capacity will now fall by as much as 2% this year, a reversal from its earlier forecast of 5% growth. American's capacity will still grow in 2019, the airline said, but at a slower rate than originally planned.
Both Southwest and American said they have held discussions with Boeing about MAX-related damages but have not reached any conclusions.
Boeing, which posted its largest-ever quarterly loss on Wednesday and warned it may have to halt 737 MAX production, has taken a $4.9 billion charge linked to customer compensation. 
FEWER SEATS, HIGHER REVENUES
With fewer planes flying in a strong domestic air travel market, airlines have been able to charge more for seats, leading to stronger rises in unit revenues, based on per available seat mile, for American and Southwest as well as its main rivals.
That trend is expected to continue into the third quarter
American's total operating revenue rose 3% to $11.96 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, while Southwest's grew 2.9% to $5.9 billion, a quarterly record for both.
American said it was extending the lifespan of some of its other 737 models as well as some 757s and A320s. But aside from MAX woes, American is also dealing with about a dozen daily cancellations it attributes to work slowdowns by its two main mechanics unions, which need new contracts.

The unions have denied an intentional slowdown and the issue is being disputed in court, though American Chief Executive Doug Parker said he was determined to get a labor contract in place.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 01:16PM ET</span>",Five things to look for in Twitter's results,"By Arriana McLymore
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) will have a chance to detail its plans to grow users and ad dollars on Friday when it releases its second-quarter earnings before the market opens.
Investors will have their eyes on Twitter's monetizable daily active users (mDAUs), its revenues, ad growth and products, live-steam partnerships and updates to its prototype app Twttr.
Below is a closer look at each in t DAILY ACTIVE USERS
Twitter reported 134 million average mDAUs in its first quarter, an 11% year-over-year increase. Analysts at Cowen expect a 28-million rise in mDAUs in the second quarter, a 1% increase.
Twitter began reporting mDAUs, a metric that tracks the number of daily users logging on to the platform, instead of monthly active users in the first quarter of this year. The new metric is supposed to help investors and advertisers better understand engagement on Twitter.
Twitter's introduction of mDAUs drew skepticism; however, some analysts think mDAUs paint a better picture of engagement. Investors need to keep an eye on Twitter's mDAU growth and how long people are using the app.
REVENUE
Ads make up a bulk of Twitter's revenue while data licensing are its other major revenue source. Twitter's first quarter saw revenue rise 18% year-over-year.
Twitter's revenues are slated for a slight 1% rise in its second quarter, from $778 million to $832 million, according to Refinitiv's Eikon. Investors should watch out for Twitter's second-quarter ad revenue growth as the company plans to launch more ad products.
AD PRODUCTS
Twitter said last quarter that it planned to improve its ad formats and promotion products on its mobile app, a move that could make more advertisers happy.
""They're getting more attuned with their users' preferences,"" said analyst Michael Pachter at Wedbush Securities. ""They're making ads more likely to be seen.""
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said the company tailors live content to users based on whom they follow.
Investors should watch out for new ad products and how they mesh with advertisers' needs, which could be a catalyst in Twitter's growth.
LIVE-STREAM PARTNERSHIPS
Twitter's live-video deals with NBCUniversal (O:CMCSA) and the National Basketball Association point to the company's efforts to be a conversation hub as it focuses on elevating content that gets people to tweet.
Twitter wants to make following events and interests as easy as following an account. Bigger and better partnerships for the live-streams could catch advertisers' attention.
Some experts are not convinced that the live-streams will have a major impact on daily users or ads as the content is generally available on television and other platforms.
Investors need to look for other major brands partnering with Twitter and the amount of engagement live-streams are able to pull in.
THE PROTOTYPE APP
Wall Street is wondering about Twitter's next steps for its prototype app ""Twttr."" The company launched the app in March to give users a place to test out features and designs. The invite-only platform is, at times, a peephole into Twitter's upcoming tools and an additional avenue for advertisers."

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>",PG&E estimates $4.8 billion of initial contribution to California Wildfire fund,"(Reuters) - Power producer PG&E Corp said on Thursday its initial contribution to California's wildfire fund would be about $4.8 billion, and annual contribution about $193 million.
The company said participation in the fund would impact its financial results.
Earlier this month, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill to create a $21 billion fund to help bankrupt PG&E and other investor-owned power companies in the state to cover liabilities from future wildfires caused by their equipment.
San Francisco-based PG&E will be the largest contributor among power companies to support the fund. Under the legislation, California's investor-owned utilities are required to agree to put a combined $5 billion for improving their electrical grids to access the fund.
The initial contribution would be payable after PG&E emerges from Chapter 11 reorganization, the company said.
The troubled company sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January after severe wildfires in 2017 and 2018 resulted in more than $30 billion in liabilities.
PG&E has been blamed for many of the blazes, including the Camp Fire that killed more than 80 people last November.

Shares of the company were up 2.1% at $19.29 in premarket trading.

1498,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 09:25AM ET</span>","Uber, Lyft and Scooters Are Winning Over Corporate Travelers","(Bloomberg) -- The transfer of funds from firms to ride-hailing companies continues to grow as the apps gain traction among North American business travelers.
  Uber Technologies Inc   (NYSE:UBER) was the most frequently expensed vendor last quarter, according to a report by Certify, a software provider enabling companies to manage travel expenses. Uber receipts made up 12.7% of all corporate transactions among Certify customers. On average, travelers spent $25.37 per Uber transaction.
Rival   Lyft   Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) also gained market share in the second quarter contributing 3.8% of all transactions, a 2.6% increase for the app from two years prior. Taxis lost market share in traditional yellow cab cities New York City and Chicago.
“If you’re a taxi owner/operator, you need to find a new business model because this trend is clear and continues to result in fewer taxi rides taken,” Certify CEO Bob Neveu said.
In an effort to curb traffic congestion and prevent further annihilation of the taxi industry, New York City and state policy makers implemented a series of rules in the past year on ride-hailing apps.
Fast-food chains are a popular choice when dining with the corporate card likely because of their prevalence and convenience. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Chick-fil-A were the top frequented restaurants last quarter. McDonald’s was the most expensed restaurant for both lunch and dinner.
A recent addition to Certify’s reports are electric scooter rides. Lime and Bird were the most-expensed scooter services. The two start-ups operate in more than 100 cities worldwide and they’ve been valued as high as $2.5 billion.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) expenses are most likely technology items and services, such as Amazon Web Services or a laptop charger. The average cost per transaction from Amazon was more that twice that for Walmart, at $121 and $55 respectively.
Certify publishes a quarterly spending report based on more than 10 million business travel transactions from clients including Exxon Mobil Corp, H&R Block, and Garmin."
1499,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 08:52AM ET</span>","Nissan to axe 12,500 jobs after first quarter profit drops 98.5%","By Naomi Tajitsu
YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) unveiled its biggest restructuring plan in a decade, axing nearly a tenth of its workforce and flagging possible plant closures to rein in costs that ballooned when Carlos Ghosn was CEO. 
The cuts announced on Thursday followed a collapse in Nissan's quarterly profit, highlighting how a crisis - brought about by sluggish sales and rising costs - is deepening at Japan's No. 2 automaker in the wake of a financial misconduct scandal over Ghosn. Ghosn has denied the charges.
The dismal quarter will pile pressure on Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, who has been tasked with shoring up the automaker's performance at a time when the industry is struggling worldwide. 
China's slowing economy, further depressed by a trade war with the United States, has hit demand, even as American consumer confidence has faltered.
Tougher emission regulation has taken as toll on diesel-car sales in Europe, and an increase in electric vehicle sales and ride-sharing has worsened a drop in sales at the world's biggest car makers.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F), the second-largest U.S. automaker, is also cutting 12,000 jobs and closing plants, while  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Aston Martin  (L:AML) and supplier Continental (DE:CONG) warned on profits this week.
JOB CUTS
Nissan will reduce at least 12,500 positions globally by March 2023 - its deepest job cuts since 2009 - and slash production capacity, mainly of compact cars at underutilized plants abroad. The move will shrink its product line-up by about 10%, Saikawa said,
The maker of the Rogue SUV crossover and the tiny, low-cost Datsun Redi-Go, had 138,000 employees as of March 2018. 
""We are mainly targeting sites where we made investments to produce compact cars under the Power 88 plan,"" Saikawa told reporters at a briefing at Nissan headquarters, referring to an aggressive growth strategy spearheaded by Ghosn in 2011 to grab 8% global market share and an 8% operating margin.
Saikawa said a total of 14 facilities would be affected.
Nissan's job cuts expand on redundancies initially announced in May, which affected eight facilities including in Spain - where trucks and vans are made - and Indonesia, where the March subcompact hatchback and Datsun models are manufactured.
Nissan also produces compact car models at facilities including in Mexico, Russia, France, and Thailand. 
Roughly half the announced job cuts so far have cost the company around 40 billion yen, and further layoffs could cost about the same, chief financial officer Hiroshi Karube said.
'VERY POOR' PROFITABILITY
Years of heavy discounting and fleet sales, particularly in the United States, has left Nissan with a cheapened brand image and low vehicle resale values, and also hit profits.
Nissan's first-quarter operating profit plunged 98.5% to 1.6 billion yen ($14.80 million), its worst performance since a loss in the March 2008 quarter.
""Profitability is very poor at the moment,"" Saikawa said, but added that the company was pushing to achieve its revenue target of 14.5 trillion yen and operating margin of 6% through the end of fiscal 2022.
The automaker said global vehicle production will fall 10% through the year to March 2023 while global sales till then will increase modestly to 6.0 million units annually from the current 5.5 million.
The company maintained its profit forecast of 230 billion yen for the year ending March 2020, a 28% drop from last year and its weakest in more than a decade.

After its victory over activist shareholder Edward Bramson who failed in his bid to dismantle the British lender's trading operations, Barclays is trying to build up its business serving hedge funds.
Barclays declined to comment.
Germany's flagship lender said on July 7 that it will axe its equities trading business as part of a major restructuring, and that  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) had signed a preliminary deal to serve prime finance and electronic equities clients impacted by the plan.
However, some of Deutsche Bank's clients are weighing alternatives to shifting their business over to the French bank, the sources familiar with the matter said. 
""It is not unexpected and perfectly natural that some clients may wish to move balances to other providers as a temporary measure while our discussions with BNP Paribas are ongoing,"" a spokesman for  Deutsche Bank  told Reuters.
""Our discussions with BNP Paribas are progressing well and we are confident that balances will move back once the deal has been completed.""
The $20 billion worth of client business in Barclays' sights includes around $10 billion with one client with whom it already has a relationship, and who has decided to shift its activities to the British bank following news of Deutsche Bank's planned exit from equities trading, one of the sources said.

BNP Paribas declined to comment.

In a statement, its third in the past 24 hours, Bio-on denied accusations of accounting irregularities and fictitious revenues made by Quintessential - a fund which has said it has an economic interest in the price movement of Bio-on's shares.
Quintessential, however, said the statement by the company failed to address its criticism, adding it would publish new documents in coming days.
Shares in Bio-on did not trade at the open on Thursday morning and only began trading around 1000 GMT when they immediately tanked, triggering another suspension. They were indicated down 75% at 12.5 euros by 1056 GMT.
Bio-on reiterated a position it first issued on Wednesday in response to Italian media reports that had picked up the Quintessential allegations, triggering a 10% fall in its shares.
Bio-on, which says its customers include Italian high-end furniture brand Kartell and consumer goods giant  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNA), said the news circulating about the company and its managers was untruthful, adding it had begun measures to safeguard its image but gave no details.
Italian market watchdog Consob is looking into Bio-on share movements, a source close to the matter said, adding it was a normal move when a stock behaved erratically.
In its report, Quintessential called Bio-on ""a massive bubble based on flawed technology and fictitious sales thanks to a network of empty shell companies""..
Bio-on is listed on the AIM market, an unregulated segment of the Italian stock exchange dedicated to small and medium-sized companies.
The company, which before the allegations had a market capitalization of just over 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion)produces what it says are environmentally-friendly plastics for the agri-food, design and cosmetics industries.
Quintessential is a New York-based hedge fund which says it specializes in exposing corporate wrongdoing.
Last year, a report by the fund into Greek jewelry maker Folli Follie led to an investigation from Greek authorities, the resignation of the company's founders and the firm seeking protection from creditors."

The company said it expected full-year sales to grow 2% compared to prior forecast of an increase of as much as 3%. It also forecast full-year adjusted profit below analysts expectation of $5.75 per share.
Hershey and other package food makers have been facing a dearth of drivers, higher diesel prices and rising prices for some commodities, which has led to record shipping costs.
To overcome that, the company raised product prices by an average of 2.5% earlier this year. The efforts helped Hershey's adjusted gross profit margin to expand 200 basis points to 46.5% in the quarter.
Net income attributable to the company rose 38% to $312.8 million, or $1.48 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from a year earlier.
Excluding items, it earned $1.31 per share and beat analysts' average estimate of $1.18 per share. 
However, sales in North America, its biggest market, rose just 0.5% to $1.57 billion in the quarter. Total sales rose about 1% to $1.77 billion, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 07:37AM ET</span>",Southwest Airlines posts quarterly profit despite 737 MAX blow,"By Tracy Rucinski and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) eked out a small profit in the second quarter on Thursday as strong bookings offset the financial blow of the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets, which forced the carrier to cease operations at Newark Liberty International airport.
Southwest, the world's largest user of the 737 MAX with 34 planes and dozens more on order, said it would be consolidating its New York City presence at LaGuardia beginning Nov. 3, as it extends MAX-related cancellations until Jan. 5, 2020. Earnings for the company at Newark airport in New Jersey came in below expectations. 
The airline had previously removed the MAX jets from its flying schedule through early November.
Shares in Southwest sank about 5% in premarket trading.
Boeing Co's (N:BA) top-selling jet was grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people within a span of five months. U.S. airlines are cancelling thousands of flights every month as they operate with slimmer fleets.
The U.S. airline said it took a $175 million hit to its operating income in the quarter from the MAX grounding, which pushed unit costs 7.5% higher, with additional cost pressure seen in the second half of 2019.
Still, customer demand remained strong and the company is pushing ahead with a Hawaii expansion next month and plans to add more Mexico service early next year.
Total operating revenue rose 2.9% to $5.9 billion in the quarter, helped by its Rapid Rewards Loyalty program, optional boarding fees and the ability to charge more for seats given reduced sector capacity.
Closely watched unit revenue, based on per available seat mile, rose 6.8% in the quarter and Southwest said it expects between 3% and 5% growth in the third quarter.
However, it said overall capacity will now decrease between 1% and 2% in 2019 due to the MAX groundings, compared with its earlier forecast of nearly 5% growth.
Based on Boeing's most recent guidance, Southwest said it is assuming regulatory approval for the MAX in the fourth quarter and will need one to two months to prepare the grounded jets for commercial service.
Net income rose to $741 million, or $1.37 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $733 million, or $1.27 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had forecast on average $1.34 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Boeing, which posted its largest-ever quarterly loss on Wednesday, has announced an after-tax charge of $4.9 billion related to potential compensation to MAX customers.

Southwest said it has had preliminary discussions with Boeing about MAX-related damages but has not reached any conclusions and did not include any amount in its quarterly results.

Massachusetts-based Raytheon and other U.S. weapons makers are expected to benefit from the recently passed $733-billion defense bill for fiscal year 2020, representing an about 2% higher spending over the previous year.
Geopolitical tensions surrounding the safe shipping of oil tankers through the Strait of Hormuz could also aid weapons sales for U.S. contractors this year.
Sales in Raytheon's missile systems unit, which makes radar threat countering high-speed anti-radiation missiles and rapid-fire, radar-guided guns for ships, rose 8% to $2.21 billion in the quarter ended June 30.
Margins in the business increased to 11.4% from 11.3%.
Last month, Raytheon agreed to merge with United Technologies (N:UTX) aerospace business to create a new company worth about $121 billion.
Raytheon said on Thursday, the merger was progressing well and was on track to close in the first half of 2020.
Revenue in Raytheon's space and airborne systems business, its second biggest, jumped 13.2% to $1.82 billion, helped by higher sales of its products including missile warning satellites and tactical radars to international customers.
Margins in the unit fell to 12.6% from 12.8%.

1511,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 06:57AM ET</span>","Fund managers make fast exits in China's new STAR Market, retail investors pile in","By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As China's new Nasdaq-style tech board approaches the end of its first week of volatile trade, fund managers are offloading their holdings to hungry retail investors and locking in bumper profits.
Frothy valuations on Shanghai's STAR Market, which debuted on Monday, have also triggered short selling from Chinese traders betting that shares will fall.
The STAR Market's launch represents Beijing's boldest move yet toward a less-regulated market for initial public offerings (IPOs) and stock trading.
But looser trading rules, China's highly speculative investor community, and severe supply-demand imbalances have sent shares skyward, setting the stage for a sharp selloff.
""The price gains exceeded our expectations,"" said Liam Zhou, founder of Shanghai-based hedge fund house Minority Asset Management (MAM). ""Such pricing represents extreme optimism in the market.""
Taking advantage of STAR Market fever that sent shares surging as much as 520% on Monday's debut, MAM, which held IPO shares worth several hundred million yuan, has ""sold a good portion"" to eager buyers, Zhou said.
""We'll stand on the sidelines and wait for the market to cool down,"" said Zhou, a contrarian investor who embraces behavioral finance - the study of investor psychology - in his investment strategy. 
According to exchange data, trading in the 25 STAR Market companies that listed this week - ranging from chip-makers to healthcare firms - totaled 48.5 billion yuan ($7.05 billion) on their debut, accounting for roughly 13% of turnover in all of China's stock markets, which include nearly 4,000 listed companies. 
Retail investors did most of the buying, accounting for more than 90% of such transactions, while institutional investors, including fund houses and insurers, accounted for most of the sellers.
Mutual funds, which actively participated in STAR Market IPOs, appeared to be big winners. Scores of them saw their net value surge more than 5% on Monday. A fund managed by JX Asset Management led the gains, jumping 9.4%.
More than 80% of the IPO shares that have no lock-up period have changed hands on the STAR Market so far, said Peng Hai, an analyst at Lianxun Securities.
SHORT SELLERS 
The scene has stirred memories of the frenzied launch of Shenzhen's now sluggish ChiNext (CHINEXTC) tech board a decade ago. On Monday, STAR stocks surged an average of 140%, much higher than ChiNext's 106% debut pop.
Short-selling demand and the limited supply of STAR Market shares available for lending has pushed borrowing costs up by as much as 20% on an annualised basis, compared with 8% for stocks elsewhere, traders said. Fuelling this are rules that allow investors to borrow newly-listed shares to sell for the first time. 
Shen Shikang, a veteran trader who has been borrowing STAR stocks to sell, said current prices of many companies on the board have no basis in fundamentals.
On the STAR Market, short-selling transactions accounted for roughly 67% of margin buying, compared with 1.7% in the whole Shanghai market, according to calculations based on official data.
Many long-only institutions have sold the IPO shares they hold. And with such investors departing, investors are now bracing for a wild ride. Roughly 150 listing candidates are queuing up, potentially boosting supply. 
China's retail investors ""may overshoot in speculative buying and then feel betrayed if and when prices deflate,"" said Drew Bernstein, co-managing partner of accounting firm Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk.
""The reality of investing in early-stage tech and biotech stocks is that not every business model pans out.""
Some hope Chinese regulators can resist any temptation to interfere in the face of volatility. 
""If the authorities take the new board's price swings in their stride, it will bode well for the long term liberalization of China's stock markets,"" Thomas Gatley, analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, wrote. 
""If, however, the regulators move to damp down the market's volatility, it will indicate that Beijing's paternalistic, interventionist attitude to China's stock markets lives on.""

Chemical companies have been struggling with uncertainty caused by trade conflicts, weak global demand as well as lower prices for ethylene and polyethylene due to higher supply from the United States, China, Korea and Thailand. 
""Looking ahead, we still see global growth, but the pace of that expansion has slowed, as buying patterns remain cautious due to ongoing trade and geopolitical uncertainties,"" Chief Executive Officer Jim Fitterling said in a statement.

Raytheon said on Thursday, the merger was progressing well and was on track to close in the first half of 2020.
Revenue in Raytheon's space and airborne systems business, its second biggest, jumped 13.2% to $1.82 billion, helped by higher sales of its products including missile warning satellites and tactical radars to international customers.
Margins in the unit fell to 12.6% from 12.8%.
The company now expects its 2019 net sales between $28.8 billion and $29.3 billion, up from a range of $28.6 billion to $29.1 billion, previously.
The company also raised its full-year forecast for earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of $11.50 to $11.70, from $11.40 to $11.60.
Raytheon's income from continuing operations rose to $817 million, or $2.92 per share in the quarter, from $799 million, or $2.78 per share, a year earlier.
Revenue in the quarter rose 8.1% to $7.16 billion.
Analysts on average had expected quarterly earnings of $2.64 per share on a revenue of $7.04 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
1520,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 06:57AM ET</span>","Fund managers make fast exits in China's new STAR Market, retail investors pile in","By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As China's new Nasdaq-style tech board approaches the end of its first week of volatile trade, fund managers are offloading their holdings to hungry retail investors and locking in bumper profits.
Frothy valuations on Shanghai's STAR Market, which debuted on Monday, have also triggered short selling from Chinese traders betting that shares will fall.
The STAR Market's launch represents Beijing's boldest move yet toward a less-regulated market for initial public offerings (IPOs) and stock trading.
But looser trading rules, China's highly speculative investor community, and severe supply-demand imbalances have sent shares skyward, setting the stage for a sharp selloff.
""The price gains exceeded our expectations,"" said Liam Zhou, founder of Shanghai-based hedge fund house Minority Asset Management (MAM). ""Such pricing represents extreme optimism in the market.""
Taking advantage of STAR Market fever that sent shares surging as much as 520% on Monday's debut, MAM, which held IPO shares worth several hundred million yuan, has ""sold a good portion"" to eager buyers, Zhou said.
""We'll stand on the sidelines and wait for the market to cool down,"" said Zhou, a contrarian investor who embraces behavioral finance - the study of investor psychology - in his investment strategy. 
According to exchange data, trading in the 25 STAR Market companies that listed this week - ranging from chip-makers to healthcare firms - totaled 48.5 billion yuan ($7.05 billion) on their debut, accounting for roughly 13% of turnover in all of China's stock markets, which include nearly 4,000 listed companies. 
Retail investors did most of the buying, accounting for more than 90% of such transactions, while institutional investors, including fund houses and insurers, accounted for most of the sellers.
Mutual funds, which actively participated in STAR Market IPOs, appeared to be big winners. Scores of them saw their net value surge more than 5% on Monday. A fund managed by JX Asset Management led the gains, jumping 9.4%.
More than 80% of the IPO shares that have no lock-up period have changed hands on the STAR Market so far, said Peng Hai, an analyst at Lianxun Securities.
SHORT SELLERS 
The scene has stirred memories of the frenzied launch of Shenzhen's now sluggish ChiNext (CHINEXTC) tech board a decade ago. On Monday, STAR stocks surged an average of 140%, much higher than ChiNext's 106% debut pop.
Short-selling demand and the limited supply of STAR Market shares available for lending has pushed borrowing costs up by as much as 20% on an annualised basis, compared with 8% for stocks elsewhere, traders said. Fuelling this are rules that allow investors to borrow newly-listed shares to sell for the first time. 
Shen Shikang, a veteran trader who has been borrowing STAR stocks to sell, said current prices of many companies on the board have no basis in fundamentals.
On the STAR Market, short-selling transactions accounted for roughly 67% of margin buying, compared with 1.7% in the whole Shanghai market, according to calculations based on official data.
Many long-only institutions have sold the IPO shares they hold. And with such investors departing, investors are now bracing for a wild ride. Roughly 150 listing candidates are queuing up, potentially boosting supply. 
China's retail investors ""may overshoot in speculative buying and then feel betrayed if and when prices deflate,"" said Drew Bernstein, co-managing partner of accounting firm Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk.
""The reality of investing in early-stage tech and biotech stocks is that not every business model pans out.""
Some hope Chinese regulators can resist any temptation to interfere in the face of volatility. 
""If the authorities take the new board's price swings in their stride, it will bode well for the long term liberalization of China's stock markets,"" Thomas Gatley, analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, wrote. 
""If, however, the regulators move to damp down the market's volatility, it will indicate that Beijing's paternalistic, interventionist attitude to China's stock markets lives on.""

Chemical companies have been struggling with uncertainty caused by trade conflicts, weak global demand as well as lower prices for ethylene and polyethylene due to higher supply from the United States, China, Korea and Thailand. 
""Looking ahead, we still see global growth, but the pace of that expansion has slowed, as buying patterns remain cautious due to ongoing trade and geopolitical uncertainties,"" Chief Executive Officer Jim Fitterling said in a statement. 
The company said it would spend only $2 billion in 2019, $500 million less than its previous forecast.
Early in July, German chemicals giant BASF (DE:BASFn) forecast a 30% fall in 2019 operating profit instead of a rise as previously predicted, blaming a slowing economy and the U.S.-China trade tiff.
Dow, which makes chemicals used in paints, cosmetics and cleaners, said costs controls as well higher volumes in its packaging and specialty plastics business helped earnings beat estimates. 
Net operating profit, which excludes certain items, stood at $649 million, or 86 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30. 
Analysts on average had expected a profit of 84 cents per share.

Net sales fell to $11.01 billion from $12.85 billion, a year earlier.

1526,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 05:49AM ET</span>","StockBeat: More Gin, But Easy on the Tonic Please","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- It’s been THE drinking trend of the last few years, but is the stock market telling us we’re reaching peak gin?
Shares in  Diageo  (LON:DGE), the world’s largest spirits maker, fell on Thursday as the company indicated that the pace of its share buybacks would slow in the coming three years, even though it said its underlying business outlook was strong.
For a mature business in a market challenged by increasing health consciousness, Diageo has had a terrific run over the last three years, rising some 85% before peaking at the start July. But the shares have fallen 6% since the beginning of the month, and the company’s report for the full fiscal year ending in June did nothing to turn them around on Thursday.
The shares lost 2.1% on a morning when the FTSE 100 was flat and most other European markets were up: the benchmark STOXX 600 rose 0.2%, while the German Dax eked out a 0.1% gain as another miserable Ifo business survey strengthened expectations that the European Central Bank will take action to support the economy.
At first glance there was little in Diageo’s update to make nervous shareholders reach for the bottle. CEO Ivan Menezes said he expected organic sales to continue growing at somewhere around 5% a year and for operating profit to rise at up to 7% a year: that’s the kind of performance that   Unilever   (LON:ULVR), another established consumer goods giant, can only dream about for the foreseeable future, judging by another meh quarterly update that came out at the same time.
Sales of gin and tequila continue to grow gangbusters, with revenue growing faster than volume – always a good sign.
Ironically, the reminder of the underlying strength of Diageo’s business has brought more benefit to Fevertree, the maker of upmarket mixers. Its shares rose 8.3% to their highest in over a month, after a sharp sell-off on the back of its own most recent trading update.
Clearly, the problem for both companies is less the business than the valuation: at 28 times earnings, according to data compiled by Investing.com, Diageo’s shares are not looking cheap – especially when they offer a dividend yield of only a little more than 2%. Buybacks are also slowing to an average of 1.5 billion pounds a year over the next three years, from 2.8 billion this year. However,  Diageo  (LON:DGE) still looks a bargain next to Fevertree (LON:FEVR), which trades at 43 times earnings despite an inevitable slowdown in its growth rate as it scales up."

Dutch Air France subsidiary KLM (PA:AIRF), the main airline at Schiphol, said it had canceled 61 flights to and from Amsterdam on Thursday, after around 200 flights were scrapped the previous day.
Many flights from Europe's third largest airport were delayed on Thursday morning, as airlines tried to get their schedules back on track.
""Many passengers have to find new flights, which is kind of a puzzle,"" a Schiphol spokesman said.
""People are slowly getting on their way, but it is still very crowded at the airport.""
The problems at Schiphol were caused by a fault in the systems that supply fuel to aircraft, which meant planes could not be provided with the fuel they needed to depart.
The airport said all problems with the fuel system were resolved on Wednesday evening, and flights would resume gradually.
This week is one of the busiest in the summer holiday period at Schiphol, with around 225,000 passengers scheduled to travel through the airport on Thursday."

The 29-year-old was scheduled to dine with the American billionaire investor on July 25 in San Francisco after winning an annual auction. He said he hoped the meal would ""bridge the gap between institutional and traditional investors and the realm of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.""
He aggressively promoted the lunch on social media only to postpone it earlier this week, saying he had fallen ill with kidney stones.
Such high-profile events are unusual in China's cryptocurrency industry which has been under heavy regulatory scrutiny for the past two years. Authorities have warned about speculation risk and banned initial coin offerings, prompting many industry players to keep a low profile.
Amid the publicity surrounding the event, reports in Chinese media suggested Sun's businesses were involved in illegal activities and that he had been barred from foreign travel. Sun denied all allegations.
In Sun's Thursday statement posted on his Weibo microblog account, he said he had been immature and ""over-marketed"" himself, and that his original good intentions to arrange the lunch with Buffett had resulted in unexpected consequences that led him to neglect his social and public responsibilities.
""This has resulted in a bad influence on the public, and incited the worries of the regulatory bodies which care for me,"" he said.
He did not specify what prompted the apology, nor did he state when or whether the lunch will be rescheduled.
Sun's company, the Tron Foundation, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. U.S. investment firm  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), which Warren Buffett chairs, did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.
Buffett offered the lunch by auction to raise money for anti-poverty charity Glide, which has said it has received Sun's donation.
Sun said he would actively cooperate with regulatory agencies to discuss his businesses' structure and plans, and that he places great importance on financial stability and curbing risk.
His Weibo post was one of the top trending topics on the microblogging site, attracting over 3,800 comments."

(Reuters) -  Nike  Inc (N:NKE), the world's largest sportswear maker, is exploring options for its surfwear brand Hurley International, including its possible divestment, according to people familiar with the matter.
Nike's potential retrenchment from the surfwear market is emblematic of the stance of most major consumer companies towards the sector. Surf brands have lost their appeal among non-surfing consumers, who now prefer boutique brands and retro streetwear.
Among the options that Nike is considering for Hurley is an outright sale of the Costa Mesa, California-born brand, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.
It is not clear how much Nike could fetch by selling Hurley. Nike declined to comment.
Nike purchased Hurley from founder Bob Hurley in 2002 for an undisclosed sum in an effort to expand beyond athletic-focused apparel and into other sportswear for surfing, skating, and snowboarding.
Bob Hurley founded the company in 1979 and achieved notoriety in the 1970s for shaping the surf board for world champion Wayne ""Rabbit"" Bartholomew.
In the last few years, the burgeoning appetite for clothing associated with the beach lifestyle and culture waned, to the point that former global leader Quiksilver filed for bankruptcy in 2015 before being taken over by private equity firm Oaktree Capital Management (N:OAK).
Mainstream fashion has dropped surfwear in favor of athleisure, while emerging fashion is turning toward urban streetwear brands like Carlyle-backed Supreme, and throwback looks like the revived sportswear brand Fila and Champion.
Last year, Boardriders Inc, the company behind Quiksilver, Roxy and DC Shoes that is owned by Oaktree, acquired its struggling Australian rival Billabong, owner of its namesake brand along with other lifestyle brands such as Element and VonZipper."

(Reuters) - Consumer goods giant  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) reported slightly weaker-than-expected quarterly underlying sales growth on Thursday, hit by wet weather in Europe and moderating growth in India, but kept its full-year sales target intact.
The company said it continues to expect full-year underlying sales growth to be in the lower half of its multi-year 3% to 5% target range and operating margin to reach 20% in 2020. 
Unilever's shares were down 1.1% in morning trade, compared to the broader FTSE 100 index (FTSE), which was flat. 
The maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream said underlying sales rose 3.5% in the second quarter, but that missed analysts' average forecasts for a 3.7% rise, according to a company-supplied consensus.
Wet weather in Europe dampened ice-cream sales following two straight seasons of hot summers, while growth in India slowed again as a late monsoon season and lower food inflation weakened rural demand.
""It seems a bit ironic with (Europe) being at super record temperatures right now, but in the quarter we are reporting, it was quite negative,"" Unilever's chief financial officer said on an earnings call with media. 
Average rainfall across 12 European cities was three times higher in April and May than the prior year, while average hours of sunshine were down between 9% and 25% in the same two months, a Jefferies analysis showed. 
Ice cream makes up 13% of Unilever's group sales and about 20% of its European sales annually. In the second quarter that rises to 30% or about 1 billion pounds ($1.25 billion) in sales, Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said in a pre-earnings note. 
Growth mainly came from emerging markets, where the company continued to win volume share in places like Indonesia and the Philippines, even though sales in India decelerated to 7% in the second quarter from 9% in the previous three months. 
Underlying sales in emerging markets rose 7.4% in the quarter, while they fell 1.6% in developed markets. Emerging markets contribute 60% to Unilever's overall sales.
Turnover inched lower to 13.7 billion euros ($15.25 billion). 

""Unilever themselves describe their markets as mixed, and most investors will look at these numbers as something of a curate's egg,"" said Steve Clayton, manager of the HL Select funds, which holds a position in Unilever.

The offer of 165 pence in cash for each Cobham share represents a 50.3% premium to the average share price over the last three months, Cobham said.
Shares in Cobham, whose technology is found on F-35 fighters and Airbus jets, jumped 35% in early deals to 165.95 pence.
Cobham, which also makes electronic warfare systems and communications for military vehicles, was shaken by a string of profit warnings in 2016 and 2017, forcing it to raise cash from shareholders.
Chief Executive David Lockwood embarked on a turnaround strategy two and half years ago, focused on improving the company's financial and operating performance.
""This offer reflects the potential for future growth and improving performance, and is an endorsement of our turnaround strategy and our hard working people,"" he said.
Lockwood's plan was hampered by problems with Boeing's troubled KC-46 aerial refueling program, but it said on Thursday its free cash flow was better than expected after a 48.7 million pound settlement of the issue.
It announced organic revenue growth of 11% to 1.03 billion pounds and a 12% rise in underlying operating profit to 107.1 million pounds in the half year to June 30.
It also said it had started a strategic review of its aviation services business in Australia.

Kumho Industrial Co Ltd (KS:002990) currently holds 33% of the conglomerate's crown jewel carrier, a stake worth 448 billion won ($379.6 million) as of Wednesday's closing price.
Kumho Asiana Group, the South Korean No.2 carrier's parent conglomerate, has been struggling with debt from an aggressive acquisition spree about a decade ago. It has agreed to sell Asiana under pressure from its lead creditor.
The official did not provide further details of the timeline of the bidding process but said the schedule would ""stay flexible.""
Kumho Industrial on Thursday sought letters of intent from potential buyers and said it was open to preliminary bids.
Its main creditor, Korea Development Bank, said in April that Asiana creditors were targeting the sale of the airline and its two budget affiliates over the next six months.
South Korea's SK Group and Hanwha Group, named as potential buyers in South Korean media reports, have said they are not interested in buying the loss-making airline. Under South Korean law, foreign investors can run but not wholly own a South Korean airline.
The Asiana conglomerate's chairman, Park Sam-koo, stepped down from his chief executive posts of Asiana Airlines and Kumho Industrial in March, after an accounting debacle rekindled concern about the group’s liquidity."
1537,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 03:01AM ET</span>","UK regulator finds Alliance, Advanz carved up market for antibiotic","(Reuters) - The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Thursday said it had found provisionally that sellers of antibiotic Nitrofurantoin broke competition law by ""arranging to carve up the market between them"".
The watchdog said from 2014 to at least October 2017, two suppliers, Advanz Pharma Corp (TO:ADVZ) and Morningside, and a wholesaler, Alliance Healthcare (SI:ALLA), entered into arrangements under which Alliance would buy equal volumes of the drug from each of the suppliers so that they would not compete.
During 2015 and 2016, the two suppliers also committed to supply the drug exclusively to Alliance, the watchdog added.
Nitrofurantoin is one of the most effective options for treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) like cystitis which are among the most common infections world-wide and have become a focal point for concerns about growing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. 
""We've provisionally found that suppliers of this important antibiotic entered into arrangements with the aim of keeping Nitrofurantoin capsule prices artificially high, meaning the NHS wouldn't benefit from the lower prices that come from effective competition,"" said Ann Pope, the CMA's Senior Director of Antitrust.
The CMA said the investigation had focused on the capsule form of Nitrofurantoin rather than tablets or liquid versions.
AMCo, now known as Advanz and formerly Concordia International Corp, was the sole UK supplier of both products, until Morningside entered the market in mid-2014, the watchdog said.

SYDNEY/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asian shares rose after a cautious start, while the euro hovered near two-month lows as soft economic data fueled hopes the European Central Bank could cut rates at its meeting on Thursday.
Those hopes are set to lift European shares, with pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.45%, German DAX futures up 0.43% and FTSE futures up 0.19% in early European trade.
Japan's Nikkei touched nearly three-month highs before trimming gains to be up 0.26%. Australian shares neared a 12-year peak, driven by expectations the ECB and the Federal Reserve will soon lower borrowing costs.
""Lower rates are generally, in a traditional, mechanical way, good news for equity prices,"" said Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan, at Nomura.
Chinese blue-chips added 0.48%, as investors looked with hope to a face-to-face meeting between top U.S. and Chinese negotiators next week, even if there are few signs that it will produce real progress in the two countries' trade war.
But shares in South Korea dropped 0.46% as leading chipmakers shed recent gains amid trade tensions between Seoul and Tokyo.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which had begun the day broadly unchanged, was last up 0.23%.
On Wall Street, tech companies led the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record highs on Wednesday after Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc hinted the slowdown in semiconductor demand would not be as long as feared.
Stock investors have generally been encouraged in recent days by hopes of some headway in Sino-U.S. trade negotiations, and expectations of easier monetary policy.
Cementing such expectations, a series of purchasing manager index (PMI) readings in the United States and Europe on Wednesday were weaker than expected.
""Equities have largely brushed off weaker global conditions given the prospects for central bank easing, and an earnings season that has so far seen around 78% of S&P500 companies beating estimates,"" said Tapas Strickland, director for economics and markets at National Australia Bank.
The Dow, however, fell 0.29% following disappointing earnings from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT).
After the closing bell, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced forecast-beating revenues for the second quarter, sending its shares higher in extended trading.
The stock has surged over 56% so far this year, despite warnings on future revenue growth from new data privacy rules and forthcoming privacy-focused product changes.
Market attention on Thursday will be squarely on the ECB rate decision after PMI data showed euro zone manufacturing contracted for the sixth straight month.
That dragged the single currency to $1.1125, a level not seen since late-May. It was last at $1.1135
""With a rate cut priced at 50%, markets are expecting at least a dovish turn from (ECB chief) Mario Draghi,"" ANZ said in a note.
In the United States, manufacturing activity slowed to a 10-year low in early July with production volumes and purchases falling.
But Nomura's McCafferty said that given the unclear ability of ever-looser monetary policy to jump-start growth, global investors are increasingly looking to signs of fiscal support.
""I think that governments around the world are looking to show a bit of muscle and put some money into the economy, whether that's through tax cuts or spending plans,"" he said.
The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, was a touch lower at 97.707. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was down 0.09% at 108.07.
The weak global backdrop has seen bond prices rise, with U.S. 10-year yields down to 2.0444% from Wednesday's close of 2.05%. German 10-year Bund yields were at -0.38% while the Feb-2029 Bund was near record lows, yielding -0.422%.
Sterling was flat at $1.2480, after falling for several sessions as market participants feared the looming possibility of a no-deal Brexit under Britain's new prime minister, Boris Johnson.
""If talks between the UK and EU break down, the GBP could see further losses,"" said Steven Dooley, currency strategist at Western Union Business Solutions.
In commodities, U.S. crude added 20 cents to $56.08 per barrel while Brent crude climbed 15 cents to $63.33.

1542,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 01:51AM ET</span>",Apple Suppliers See Demand for New iPhones Stabilizing This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s suppliers are preparing to produce components for up to 75 million new iPhones in 2019’s second half, roughly the same number as a year earlier, according to people familiar with the matter.
The volumes planned for the next iPhone launch cycle would signal steady demand for the company’s most important product, despite U.S.-China trade tensions and a decline in the overall smartphone market. The Cupertino, California-based technology giant stopped divulging iPhone shipment numbers in the holiday quarter last year as unit growth turned negative and started providing metrics to highlight the growth of services such as Apple Music. Analysts estimate Apple sold 70 million to 80 million new iPhones in the second half of last year.
The company’s Asian suppliers are gearing up to crank out components for three new iPhone models to meet holiday-season demand, the people said, asking not to be identified citing internal estimates. The U.S. company’s Asian partners could ramp production up to 80 million new phones if needed, one of the people said. Main iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group has stepped up hiring in Shenzhen and is offering staff about 10% more than a year ago to secure a peak-period workforce, another person familiar with the matter said.
Apple has announced new iPhones each September since 2012 and the new models typically go on sale in the final weeks of that month. The company reports third quarter earnings on July 30, and the firm’s guidance could indicate its expectations for iPhone sales at the end of the fourth quarter ending in September. Apple still provides iPhone revenue figures, with the company generating $52 billion from iPhones last holiday quarter, a 15% decline, and $37 billion from new iPhones in the last fourth quarter, a 27% increase. Those numbers, however, include a mix of both last year’s new models and earlier versions of the iPhone.
Jeff Pu at GF Securities estimates that shipments of newly released iPhones will rise to 74 million in the second half, up about 7% from his estimate of 69 million last year, while TF International analyst Ming-Chi Kuo forecast that Apple would sell 75 million to 80 million new iPhones in the second half of 2018. This year’s volumes may signal stabilization after a year of uncertainty, though that’s a far cry from the double-digit growth numbers of years past.
Of course, the fact that Apple suppliers plan to produce parts for 75 million new iPhones doesn’t necessarily mean the company will sell that many. Apple will assess sales after launch and the total shipments may not reach that mark. The company declined to comment.
Apple is struggling with soft smartphone demand as people take longer to replace their gadgets and Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies Co. grab market share. The trade war is also denting Chinese economic growth while souring consumers there on American brands. Analysts have been betting on a 13.3% drop in iPhone shipments to roughly 189 million in fiscal 2019, according to average projections compiled by Bloomberg.
“Apple’s growth has become more cyclical and slowed along with the global smartphone market, leaving it dependent on iPhone upgrades to drive sales,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts John Butler and Boyoung Kim said. “Apple’s inability to raise iPhone prices much higher is constraining growth. Weakness in China due to competition and the trade war with the U.S. remains an issue.”
While Apple is relying on services to take up the slack, sales of the gadget remain its largest revenue driver and the U.S. company needs to get the latest devices into the hands of its users so they can actually download and subscribe to new services like the upcoming Apple Card, Apple Arcade gaming service, and Apple TV+, a Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) rival.
The major attraction in this year’s models lies in enhanced cameras: the two high-end models to replace the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max will include three back cameras, up from two, and a successor to the iPhone XR will include a second back camera. The third camera will serve as an additional ultra-wide lens, Bloomberg News reported in January, allowing the phone to automatically repair parts of an image that may be initially chopped out of a frame. It will also enable a wider range of zoom. All three new models will also include faster A13 processors built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Bloomberg News reported in May.
Beyond the additional rear cameras, the new iPhone models will look similar to the 2018 versions, which looked like the 2017 iPhone X. Apple is planning a more extensive revamp of the iPhone with an updated design, 5G connectivity, and new augmented reality cameras for 2020, Bloomberg has also reported.

Apple may benefit from a U.S. ban on the sale of American technology to Huawei, not to mention Japanese exports curbs to Korea that threaten Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co.

Officials including those from the People’s Bank of China and China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission recently held a meeting with financial institutions in Bank of Jinzhou’s home province of Liaoning to discuss measures to resolve the lender’s liquidity issues, Reuters reported Wednesday citing sources it didn’t identify. PBOC and Bank of Jinzhou didn’t immediately reply to Bloomberg’s requests for comment.
Bank of Jinzhou’s Hong Kong-listed shares have been suspended since April after it failed to disclose its 2018 financial statements. Auditors Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP and Ernst & Young resigned saying there are indications that some loans to institutional customers weren’t used in ways consistent with the purposes stated in documents, Bank of Jinzhou disclosed in May.
China’s smaller lenders have been under increased scrutiny since the surprise government takeover of Baoshang Bank Co. The move led to a repricing of risk for much of China’s banking system which had long operated under an assumption that policy makers would support firms in trouble.
“We expect the regulators to step up their support if more financial institutions run into liquidity issues,” said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc, who declined to comment directly about Bank of Jinzhou. “Over time, the cost of funding between the stronger and weaker financial institutions will see further divergence.”
Bank of Jinzhou was among the lenders named by Jason Bedford, a UBS Group AG analyst, who in 2017 highlighted Baoshang’s troubles. Bank of Jinzhou is the second-most reliant on interbank financing, particularly non-bank financial institutions’ deposits, among more than 200 local banks, Bedford said when reached by phone on Thursday.
The bank’s seven negotiable certificates of deposits -- a type of funding that small banks heavily rely on -- were indicated at yields ranging from 3%-5.5%, higher than valuations of 2.8%-3.45%, according to Bloomberg data. Its dollar-denominated loss-absorbing debt instruments, known as AT1 bonds, fell on Thursday, according to credit traders.
Bank of Jinzhou’s NCDs will continue to face selling pressure until authorities reveal a plan for the lender, said Li Yunfei, an analyst at Pacific Securities Co.
Bank of Jinzhou was set up in 1997 in the northeastern province of Liaoning. It had total assets of $113 billion and total deposits of $53 billion in June 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank listed in Hong Kong in December 2015, and has gained about 50% since its debut.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 01:43AM ET</span>",SK Hynix warns of chip supply disruption on Japan's export curbs,"By Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - Chipmaker SK Hynix Inc warned on Thursday of a supply disruption due to an escalating trade dispute between South Korea and Japan, and said it would cut investment and production to support a nascent recovery in chip demand.
The global memory chip market is bottoming out after more than a year of steep price falls, and hopes of a recovery are being buoyed by Japan's restrictions on exports of some chipmaking materials to South Korea - home to the world's top two memory chipmakers, Samsung and Hynix.
""We are trying to secure inventories of chip materials as much as possible ... but we cannot rule out production disruption if Japanese export controls drag on, so we are keeping a close eye on that,"" Jin-Seok Cha, head of SK Hynix's finance and procurement, told analysts.
SK Hynix, a key Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, joins other local peers scurrying to find alternative suppliers to guard against a supply shortage of high-tech materials restricted by Japan.
The company was working on diversifying vendors and minimizing input of the materials affected by Japanese export curbs, Cha added, without elaborating.
Flat-screen maker LG Display, which also secures such materials from Japan, said on Tuesday it was looking to diversify its supplier base.
South Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee met U.S. tech industry groups on Wednesday to flag concerns about the potential for the Japanese restrictions to hurt global supply chains, a trade ministry official said.
SK Hynix shares jumped nearly 3%, as investors looked beyond disappointing earnings and pinned their hopes on a semiconductor market recovery.
Shares in Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) also rose 1%, outperforming a 0.7% drop in the wider market.
Expectations of a recovery in the chip market also were boosted by Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc's comments that the slowdown in chip demand would not last as long as feared.
SK Hynix said it would cut DRAM output capacity from the fourth quarter and increase its planned NAND wafer input reduction this year to more than 15% from 10% previously. Investment for next year would be ""significantly lower"" than this year, it added.
The world's second-largest memory chip maker behind Samsung reported its smallest quarterly earnings in three years.
April-June operating profit plunged 89% to 638 billion won ($541.9 million) due to weak chip prices, missing a 828 billion won Refinitiv SmartEstimate. SmartEstimates give more weight to recent estimates by analysts who are more consistently accurate.
Prices of NAND flash memory chips have fallen sharply over the past year as output grew faster than demand and the U.S.-China trade war played havoc with global markets for electronics like smartphones.
Prices for DRAM chips, which help devices perform multiple tasks, declined 25% in the second quarter from three months earlier, according to data from tech researcher TrendForce.
Revenue fell 38% from a year earlier to 6.5 trillion won, SK Hynix said."

Seazen has already sold interests in 10 projects for a total of 4.15 billion yuan, representing 13.6% of its net assets in 2018, said Future Land, the country's eighth-largest property developer by sales.
This comes after Future Land's ex-chairman Wang Zhenhua was detained and then arrested by police earlier this month for child molestation, sending its shares into a tailspin. The firm had replaced him with his 31-year old son, Wang Xiaosong.
A unit of Jinke Property Group (SZ:000656) bought six of Future Land's projects for around 1.72 billion yuan, the Chongqing-based group said in a filing on Wednesday.
The proposed and actual transactions will not have material impact on 2019 operating results and financial performance, Future Land said in separate filings late on Wednesday and early on Thursday.
The developer had said earlier this week that Seazen was in talks to sell around 40 projects to recoup part of the land payment made in the first half.
These transactions will increase Seazen's monetary funds, improve the asset and liability structure, increase the current ratio, and strengthen its ability to repay debts, said Future Land in its filing published on Wednesday.
The newly acquired net cash will provide assurances for investments, and stable and safe operations of other projects, it added.
""Large developers usually buy project companies, not sell. While the sales are good for the company's cash flow, it may be a bad signal for its business,"" said Toni Ho, RHB Hong Kong head of research.
Future Land will not be a growth play going forward as it was used to be, he added.
The projects to be sold will only be residential ones that are newly acquired in the open market and not ready for sale, the company said.
It maintained its 2019 annual contract sales target at 270 billion yuan.
Shares of Future Land climbed as much as 2.2% on Thursday morning, compared with a 0.3% rise in the broader market (HSI)."

SoftBank's board will meet on Thursday to approve the commitment, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 
While the first, $100 billion Vision Fund launched with $60 billion in backing from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, SoftBank has pledged to launch its second even without such support as it markets the fund to potential investors.
The second fund has secured investment from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN), WSJ said. 
Goldman hopes the commitment will help secure work on the growing number of SoftBank portfolio companies heading to the public markets, the report said. Kazakhstan's sovereign wealth fund will also invest, the WSJ said. 
SoftBank, Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered declined to comment. 
Tokyo-based SoftBank can tout the 45% internal rate of return made by investors in the first fund's common shares - albeit gains that are mostly on paper.
Since the first fund's launch its biggest outside investor, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), has been pulled further into domestic projects as the government runs a larger-than-expected deficit, potentially limiting its overseas ambitions.
While PIF is among existing investors in talks with SoftBank, any decision to invest in the second fund will be made only after assessing a formal proposal, a source familiar with the talks said. 

With the first Vision Fund having burned though much of its cash in the two years since it launched with investments in more than 80 late stage tech startups, the fund's manager is ramping up its staff numbers as it looks to manage the transition to the launch of the second fund.

The country's second-largest lender by assets has signed a pact to deepen strategic cooperation with the Hunan government on Wednesday, the provincial government said in a statement on its website.
The financing support will help ""promote the high-quality development of manufacturing industry, foster and strengthen key enterprises and 'little giant' enterprises, and prevent and resolve local government hidden desk risks"", it said.
The statement did not elaborate on what the scope of financing support. CCB did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for seeking clarifications.
The landlocked province has come under spotlight due to its shaky state of local government finances. Shaoyang, a city in Hunan, was singled out by the National Audit Office last year for having raised hidden debt worth 7.2 billion yuan.
Leiyang, another city in Hunan, in May last year did not have enough money to pay the salaries of its civil servants, according to local media reports.
Strict control over debt risks partly contributed to the declining infrastructure investment growth in the first six months this year, said the local statistics bureau.
Hunan's economic growth slowed to 7.2% in the first half this year from a 7.8% expansion in 2018, official data showed."

Wu Qian, spokesman of China’s defence ministry, said the People’s Liberation Army could be deployed in Hong Kong if protests continue.
Wu said the “behaviour of some radical demonstrators ... is absolutely intolerable” and that they “challenges the central government’s authority, touching on the bottom line principle of ‘one country, two systems.”
Under a “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong was guaranteed a high degree of control over its own affairs until 2047.
Tensions in the city rose to an unprecedented level following multiple mass protests since June against a proposed extradition bill. Some people believe the proposed law by the government is another sign that Hong Kong citizens’ civil rights are slowly eroding under Beijing’s control.
On Wednesday, Ireland issued a travel warning for Hong Kong while countries including Japan, South Korea and Canada advised their citizens to be wary following violent clashes in Yuen Long over the past weekend that saw a rampaging mob assaulted members of the public in the MTR station, including journalists.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 09:54PM ET</span>","Facebook warns of costly privacy changes, discloses another U.S. probe","By Paresh Dave and Akanksha Rana
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said on Wednesday that new rules and product changes aimed at protecting users' privacy would slow its revenue growth into next year and significantly raise expenses, taking the shine off quarterly revenue results that beat expectations.
The outlook was the latest twist in a day of contrasting news for the world's largest social media company. Facebook earlier agreed to pay $5 billion to settle a U.S. Federal Trade Commission data privacy probe but then disclosed that the regulator was now investigating it for anti-competitive behavior.
The settlement, which lawmakers and privacy experts criticized as a ""slap on the wrist"" for a company whose revenues last year topped $55 billion, suggested that Facebook had moved past a major regulatory challenge that has dogged it over the last year.
But Facebook's chief financial officer, Dave Wehner, warned that operational changes required by the settlement would be costly. In addition, he said, revenue will be hurt by new limits on usage of consumer data being set by governments around the world and by tech companies on whose systems Facebook relies. He did not elaborate.
The guidance demonstrates the lasting effects of Facebook's failure over the last decade to adequately secure some users' personal information and inform users how its business partners were accessing the data.
Still, Facebook said the second straight quarter of above-expectations revenue showed that its namesake app is producing growth even as users gravitate toward newer, more private features whose popularity has outstripped their usage among advertisers.
Second-quarter revenue rose to $16.9 billion from $13.2 billion a year ago, beating analysts' average estimate of $16.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Shares of Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, rose 0.87% after hours to $206.44 after whipsawing amid the results and guidance. The shares have recouped most of the losses sparked a year ago on concerns of slowing usage and the costs of improving privacy.
For the quarter, Facebook reported 2.7 billion monthly users and 2.1 billion daily users across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, both figures about the same as last quarter.
""News regarding FTC and data privacy, along with antitrust investigations and additional headline risks (are) likely to continue to hang over the stock, but it looks like the platform still remains a very popular destination for the users,"" Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said in an email to Reuters.
U.S. PROBES
Facebook has faced questions for the past three years from regulators and users worldwide over how services designed to share news and events with friends and family have become platforms for spreading misinformation about politics and health. It also suffered data breaches, prompting investigations in several countries.
The FTC inquiry settled on Wednesday stemmed from allegations that Facebook allowed information belonging to 87 million users to be inappropriately shared with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.
Facebook, which had set aside $3 billion in the first quarter for the settlement, said it took a $2 billion charge in the second quarter to account for the remainder.
The deal, which is subject to court approval, also requires Facebook to document for the FTC any privacy-related decisions about new products. It must establish a privacy committee on its board, and executives must regularly attest to the company's proper handling of user content.
Wehner said the settlement would require ""significant investment"" in hiring and technology.
The newly disclosed antitrust probe, which Facebook said it learned of from the FTC last month, shows that other regulatory hurdles remain.
Reuters and other news agencies reported in June that the FTC was gearing up to investigate complaints about the massive market power of Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
But Facebook on Wednesday suggested it may also be in the crosshairs of the Justice Department, acknowledging in a statement the agency's announcement a day earlier of an antitrust review of large internet companies. The Justice Department did not specify targets, and Facebook declined to elaborate.
Facebook has expanded programs and promises in response to political pressure on several issues, including policing objectionable content.
Costs jumped 66% compared to a year ago, to nearly $12.3 billion, as Facebook continues to ramp up such initiatives.
The FTC payment in part cut second-quarter profit to $2.6 billion, compared with $5.1 billion a year earlier. Excluding the settlement and a $1.1 billion one-time tax expense, earnings would have been $1.99 per share, Facebook said.
The expectations for its ad business and cost forecasts could hurt profit margins, particularly in the fourth quarter, Facebook said."

ANZ, one of Australia's Big Four banks, said it has been informed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) that the proceedings relate to fees charged for periodical payments in some cases before February 2016.
The fees were the subject of a class action suit settled late last year for A$1.5 million ($1.05 million) and pending court approval, ANZ said. ASIC is seeking penalties for 1.3 million occasions where the fees were applied, the bank said.
The action comes at a time of increased scrutiny of banks following the Royal Commission, a powerful inquiry last year that exposed compliance and governance failures across the financial sector.
The corporate watchdog earlier this month said it could take ""significant enforcement action"" against some of the country's largest banks, including ANZ, over sales earlier this decade of insurance products that it said harmed customers.
""ANZ categorically denies any deliberate wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend any such allegation,"" the bank said in a statement on Thursday, adding it would not provide further comment as the matter will be before the courts.
An ASIC spokesman confirmed the regulator's intent to issue proceedings in the Federal Court against ANZ and said it would comment further once the filing has occurred."

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) on Wednesday pushed back its profit timeline once again after missing financial targets in the second quarter, while announcing that the pioneer of the company's electric batteries, J.B. Straubel, was stepping down from his role as chief technology officer.
A quarterly loss was deeper than expected, and despite record deliveries in the quarter, revenue came in lighter than analysts' expectations. Moreover, margins - a focus of investors - narrowed in the quarter, adding to Tesla's challenges in delivering profit going forward.
Shares fell 11.5% after hours and extended losses after the announcement about Straubel, a founding engineer who will become a senior adviser.
Under pressure to meet his repeated promises to make Tesla sustainably profitable, Chief Executive Elon Musk is trying to contain costs while still spending on major initiatives from a Shanghai factory and assembly-line to upcoming models such as the Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.
Tesla initially promised to be profitable in the third quarter of 2018 and has now pushed back that target multiple times. Now profit is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019, with the current quarter to be break-even, Musk said.
In a statement on Wednesday, Tesla said it was focusing less on profit and more on volume growth, capacity expansion and cash generation. Musk said the company had grown to the point of ""being self-funding,"" indicating he might not need another cash infusion following a record-setting capital raising earlier this year.
Tesla said on Wednesday it had trimmed its capital expenditure target for 2019 to $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion, from $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion. It ended the quarter with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
Investing.com analyst Clement Thibault told Reuters that Tesla's results ""will inevitably lead to more questions about its ability to stabilize and turn a profit.""
Tasked with Tesla's groundbreaking battery technology since Tesla's early beginnings, Straubel directed the development of the audacious plan to make a sportscar powered by bundled laptop batteries. The quiet, retiring Straubel has been seen as a good partner for showy Musk. Straubel had been the last senior executive of long-standing at the very top rank of the company to remain at Tesla.
Even while growing, Tesla has laid off workers and pledged to close some stores to lower costs. Facing increased competition from a slew of European rivals with electric offerings, it has also tinkered with its pricing.
Most recently, it eliminated the least expensive versions of its Model S sedan and Model X SUV, while cutting the starting price of its Model 3 to $38,990.
Tesla's strong second-quarter deliveries assuaged doubts about demand for the Model 3, but concerns linger, especially since a federal tax credit was cut by half on July 1 and expires at the end of the year.
Many analysts note that Tesla will be challenged not only to meet its deliveries target of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year, but to keep profit margins from further eroding.
Automotive gross margins dropped in the quarter from 20% to 19%.
Musk gave bold predictions for the long-term demand for the Model 3 and upcoming Model Y combined, saying that it could reach 2 million vehicles per year.
The company repeated a target of producing 10,000 vehicles per week globally by the end of 2019.
Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said orders in the current quarter were so far higher than those seen in the second quarter.
A 58.7% revenue rise to $6.35 billion in the quarter fell short of the $6.41 billion estimated by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, even as a non-GAAP loss of $1.12 per share was deeper than the loss of 36 cents they expected.
Shares of Tesla are down 22% since the beginning of the year, but they have been rebounding since early June, after hitting their lowest close since early 2016 at $178.97."

(Reuters) -  Xilinx Inc  (O:XLNX) said it had resumed some sales to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd but forecast current-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, citing the impact of U.S. restrictions on selling to the Chinese telecommunications firm.
The forecast and sent the chipmaker's shares down 5.78% to $125.50 in extended trading. Xilinx makes programmable chips that are used in data centers to speed up tasks like artificial intelligence work, as well as chips that are used in 5G telecommunications base stations.
Company executives did not disclose how much revenue the Xilinx derives from Huawei, but said no single customer accounted for more than 10% of its revenue and that Xilinx has cut its sales expectations for Huawei by more than half.
Chief Executive Victor Peng said that Xilinx stopped all sales to Huawei in May when U.S. restrictions took effect. Peng said that during the fiscal first-quarter ended June 29, Xilinx determined that some of its products, such as its older, 28-nanometer chips and some chips not designed for 5G gear, could legally could be sold to Huawei.
Xilinx resumed shipping those chips and has also applied for licenses with the U.S. Commerce Department to resume selling other products to Huawei.
On a conference call, analysts pressed the company on whether Huawei might speed the transition to fully custom chips made by its HiSilicon unit to replace Xilinx's chips. Peng told analysts he did not think that would happen quickly.
""They're certainly not going to give up on 5G,"" Peng said. ""They've architected it in certain ways. That's not something that anybody could just change on a dime.""
The company said it expects second-quarter revenue of between $800 million and $850 million, below analysts' average estimate of $852.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Peng told analysts that the company continues to ship chips to other companies building out networks for 5G, the next generation of wireless data communications, including ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063), which had previously been the target of U.S. restrictions but has since had them removed.
Other chipmakers, such as Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO), have said they expect other electronics makers to step in and eventually fill in lost Huawei sales, but Peng told Reuters that is less likely to happen in the market for 5G gear.
""Infrastructure is just different. There's not as many people who can do it,"" Peng told Reuters in an interview. ""It's a well-known fact that the Chinese operators have favored the domestic suppliers"" such as Huawei and ZTE, among others.
Flores said that the company was ""not reiterating or updating our full-year guidance"" for the full fiscal 2020 year and that its outlook was ""somewhat moderated by trade-related concerns."" In May, the company said it expected between $3.45 billion and $3.6 billion in revenue. Xilinx it will give more details on its full-year forecast in October."

Shares of Facebook moved more than 1% higher after the report, but then retreated into negative territory after warning revenue growth might slow in the second half.
Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
2. Tech Earnings Galore: Amazon, Google), Intel and More!
The earnings season kicks up a gear Thursday, with quarterly earnings from tech heavyweights. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report after markets close.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to report earnings per share of 89 cents for the second quarter on sales of $15.7 billion.
The chipmaker’s data center business, which represents almost a third of total revenue, will likely garner added attention as data center spending has been hurt by a slowdown in China.
With shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) up more than 30% year to date and flirting with $1 trillion in market cap, it may take a lot to impress investors tomorrow.
Performance of the company’s North America segment, which accounts for the bulk of revenue, and its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, will be closely watched.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expected to report earnings of $5.56 a share on revenue of about $62.5 billion, according to estimates compiled by Investing.com.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is expected to report earnings of $11.10 a share on revenue of $38.2 billion.
Margins likely will be closely watched as the search-engine giant has increased focus on lower-margin businesses like Cloud, YouTube and hardware. The company in the first quarter said that it would ramp up spending on marketing. 
3. Jobless Claims, Durable Goods on Tap
Durable goods orders and jobless claims numbers make up the top-tier economic data on the calendar Thursday.
The Commerce Department will report June’s orders for goods lasting three years or more at 8:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Durable goods orders are expected to rebound 0.8% in June following a 1.3% decline in May, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are predicted to have risen 0.2% in June compared with 0.4% in the prior month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Charter Communications  (O:CHTR) submitted a proposal to the Justice Department to buy telecom assets being sold under the T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) and Sprint Corp (N:S) combination, but never heard back from the agency, three sources familiar with the matter said.
U.S. officials decided to accept a deal to sell assets including Sprint's Boost Mobile brand to satellite TV provider Dish Network (O:DISH) to resolve antitrust concerns, ending extensive talks on a merger the Justice Department is expected to approve this week.
The Justice Department's lack of response to Charter could raise concerns among critics of the $26.5 billion merger of wireless carriers T-Mobile and Sprint that officials did not weigh all divestiture offers before deciding on a deal with Dish.
Details of the proposal were not immediately known, but sources said this week Charter had requested that there be an auction process for the divested assets.
The Justice Department and Charter declined to comment.
Ten state attorneys general, led by New York and California and including the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on June 11 to stop the merger, saying it would cost their subscribers more than $4.5 billion annually. Four more states have since joined the lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleges that the merger will reduce competition in the wireless market and be particularly harmful to low-income and rural Americans.
Dish emerged as the leader to acquire the prepaid phone brand Boost Mobile, which T-Mobile and Sprint are selling in order to gain regulatory approval for their merger. Charter began offering its own mobile service called Spectrum Mobile last year, which runs on Verizon Communications’ (N:VZ) network. It served 310,000 mobile lines as of the first quarter. 
Dish, which has been stockpiling billions of dollars worth of wireless spectrum, faces a March 2020 deadline to build a product using the spectrum in order to fulfill the requirements of its licenses. It has focused on building an Internet of Things network, with the goal of eventually having a 5G wireless network. 
The Federal Communications Commission has indicated it is prepared to approve the Sprint and T-Mobile merger.

The Justice Department has historically given parameters for whom they believe should buy assets divested as part of a merger, but often leaves it to the companies themselves to strike an appropriate deal.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 06:11PM ET</span>",J.C. Penney tie-up favorable for Sephora business: LVMH,"PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. sales at beauty retailer Sephora picked up in the second quarter after a sluggish end to 2018, its parent LVMH (PA:LVMH) said on Wednesday, citing its continued tie-up with U.S. department store J.C. Penney (N:JCP).
The 117-year-old money-losing chain based in Paris, which has rolled out hundreds of Sephora shops within its stores across the United States, hired advisers to explore debt restructuring options, Reuters reported last week.
J.C. Penney Co Inc said in a statement it had no significant near-term debt maturities and was not preparing for bankruptcy.
It described working with advisers as ""taking positive and proactive measures, as we have done in the past, to improve our capital structure and the long-term health of our balance sheet,"" and said the company maintained a ""strong liquidity position.""
LVMH, a French luxury goods conglomerate that also owns fashion brands like Christian Dior, declined to comment on J.C. Penney's broader situation.
""We're not in all the (JCPenney) stores but in a large amount of them. The business is not as good as it used to be but is nevertheless quite favorable,"" LVMH Financial Director Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts after the group posted second-quarter sales.
""We are one of the pockets of growth of J.C. Penney, we are important to them, they are important to us,"" Guiony said.
LVMH relies on Sephora as one of its biggest sales drivers after its fashion and handbag brand Louis Vuitton.
The beauty retailer has pushed rapidly into the United States in recent years, taking on rivals like Ulta (O:ULTA), in part by building out stores within JCPenney premises under a partnership that started in 2006.
It now has more than 660 shops under the JCPenney umbrella, which still outnumber the 500 standalone stores it has opened across the Americas. This year, it has announced 35 openings of non-JCPenney U.S. stores, and is also pushing online sales.
Sephora also faces growing competition from the likes of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), as the e-commerce giant pushed into cosmetics with its own brands and a collaboration with singer Lady Gaga.
LVMH's retailing division, which also includes duty-free shopping operator DFS, had posted muted comparable sales growth of 3% in the fourth quarter of last year, partly due to a sluggish U.S. turn at Sephora at a time when make-up sales globally are softening.
""We had a better second quarter than the first quarter, which in turn was much better than the fourth quarter of last year, so gradually the situation is improving,"" Guiony said.
The retailing division grew 7% in the April to June period from a year earlier.
J.C. Penney - which is in turnaround mode and refocusing more on clothing as it tries to counter falling footfall - said in May that sales at stores open for at least a year had fallen more than expected during the first quarter."

DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Wednesday reported a lower-than-expected profit, weighed down by charges to restructure its units in Europe and South America, and the automaker gave a full-year earnings forecast that fell short of analysts' expectations.
Ford shares fell as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading.
Virtually all of Ford's second-quarter pre-tax profit came from North America - its most lucrative market - where highly-profitable pickup trucks drive margins for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker and its Detroit rivals, General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU).
The automaker also posted a small profit in Europe and a far smaller loss in China compared with the second quarter of 2018 as better pricing and new luxury models helped offset a poor performance in that market.
Ford's second-quarter sales in China slid 21.7% in the second quarter after a first-quarter drop of 35.8%. 
In April, Ford said it planned to launch more than 30 new models over the next three years to overhaul its vehicle lineup in China.
The automaker's ongoing restructuring includes cutting costs and overhauling its product lineup in key global markets like China and Europe. The company said Wednesday it had so far only recorded $2.2 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take for the global restructuring. 
Last month, Ford said it would cut 12,000 jobs, close five plants and cut shifts at other factories in Europe by the end of 2020 in an effort to return that region to profitability.
In May, the company said it would eliminate about 10% of its global salaried workforce, cutting about 7,000 jobs by the end of August.
Earlier this month, Ford and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles, deepening a global alliance to slash development and manufacturing costs. The size and timing of the payoff from that alliance remain unclear.
Ford had previously not provided an earnings forecast for this year. The company said on Wednesday it now expects full-year earnings between $1.20 and $1.35 per share. Analysts have estimated the automaker will earn $1.39 per share this year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Speaking to reporters, Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone said the company now expects adjusted 2019 pre-tax profit of up to $7.5 billion, compared with $7 billion in 2018.
""We have a long way to go ... to execute on our redesign,"" Stone said. ""We have a lot of work to do.""
For the first half of the year, Ford reported a pre-tax profit of $4.1 billion, meaning that the automaker will, at best, deliver a weaker pre-tax profit of $3.4 billion for the second half of 2019.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker posted a second-quarter net profit of $148 million, or 4 cents per share, down from $1.1 billion, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time charges, the company earned 28 cents per share. Analysts had expected Ford to earn 31 cents a share.
Excluding a write-down of its stake in a software company, Ford said it would have earned 32 cents per share.

Revenue was flat at $38.9 billion, above the $35.07 billion expected.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 05:44PM ET</span>","Explainer: What Google, Facebook could face in U.S. antitrust probe","By Bryan Pietsch
(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether big technology companies are engaged in anticompetitive behavior, addressing a rising tide of criticism they have become too powerful to the detriment of consumers.
The Justice Department has said it will investigate ""whether and how"" online platforms in ""search, social media, and some retail services online"" are engaging in behavior that stifles competition and harms consumers.
While the Justice Department did not name any targets in announcing the probe on Tuesday, sources have indicated Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, social media giant  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), online retailer Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and possibly Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will likely be reviewed.
Here's what regulators could focus on at the big technology companies:
GOOGLE
The Justice Department is expected to focus on allegations Google harms competitors by favoring its own products in search results, though sources told Reuters the department will look at all of Google's businesses, including advertising and its Android mobile platform.
Google has said it is transparent in how it promotes its own services and that changes to its search algorithms are made with consumers in mind.
Google has also faced criticism for allegedly abusing its dominance in advertising. Platforms that want to host advertising on their own sites often have to go through Google or Facebook to do so.
European antitrust regulators fined Google $5 billion in 2018 and ordered it to stop using its Android platform to block competitors. The European Union alleged that Google's illegal actions include forcing device manufacturers, who use the Android platform on their phones, to pre-install Google apps on devices, blocking out competitors' apps.
Google said in a blog post that it would ""do more to ensure"" that Android users know about other options they can download.
Republican U.S. lawmakers have also charged that Google and other tech companies are biased against conservative voices. Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in April that ""using the powers of monopoly to censor political speech ... raises real antitrust issues.""
Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president of government affairs and public policy, denied those claims in a Fox News op-ed and Democrats say there is no evidence to back the charges.

Facebook has faced criticism it is a monopoly, with over 2.4 billion monthly users as of April this year, about a third of the world's population.
In 2012, Facebook bought social media app Instagram, one of its competitors. In 2014, it bought another of its competitors, messaging platform WhatsApp.
In a U.S. House of Representatives hearing last week, Facebook's head of global policy development Matt Perault stressed Facebook's competitors as evidence it is not a monopoly.
Critics have called for Facebook to sell off WhatsApp and Instagram.
The company has also been criticized for copying the ""story"" function that competitor Snapchat is known for, implementing the option to share a photo temporarily on both Facebook and Instagram.
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
AMAZON
In the United States, half of all online shopping transactions happen on Amazon, giving the e-commerce company sway over merchants that use its platforms. Amazon has been criticized for its power over third-party sellers on its website, who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private label sales by Amazon's own brands.
Amazon has also faced criticism that its low prices have hurt brick-and-mortar retailers, including some who have closed because they could not compete.
But in a 2018 letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said ""Amazon remains a small player in global retail"" because most commerce still happens offline.
Amazon reached an agreement with German antitrust authorities last week to change its agreement with third-party merchants following an investigation of complaints from the sellers that its terms were unfair.
European Union regulators are investigating Amazon's data agreements with sellers. The European Commission has been seeking feedback about Amazon's dual role as a marketplace for merchants and as a competitor in that marketplace.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday there was ""no question"" that Amazon limits competition and has harmed U.S. retailers.
In response, an Amazon spokesman said small businesses are ""thriving with Amazon"" and that independent sellers make up more than 58% of its gross merchandise sales.
APPLE
Last month, app developers Donald R. Cameron and Illinois Pure Sweat Basketball alleged in federal court that Apple's policy of only allowing the downloading of iPhone apps through its official App Store is anticompetitive. Apple mandates developers to price apps in tiers ending in 99 cents and takes up to a 30% commission from developers on app sales.
Music-streaming app Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) has alleged that App Store policies make it difficult to compete against Apple Music for paid subscribers.
Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told CBS News in an interview that Apple does not have a dominant position in any market."

Mnuchin said he looked forward to hearing the results of a Justice Department probe, announced on Tuesday, into whether big U.S. technology firms engage in anticompetitive practices, the strongest sign yet that the Trump administration is stepping up its scrutiny of Big Tech.
""If you look at Amazon, although they're certain benefits to it, they've destroyed the retail industry across the United States,"" Mnuchin told CNBC. ""I don't have an opinion other than I think it's absolutely right the attorney general is looking into these issues and I look forward to listening to his recommendations to the president.""
Amazon defended itself, saying that 90% of all sales occur in brick-and-mortar stores.
""Today, independent sellers make up more than 58% of physical gross merchandise sales on Amazon, and their sales have grown twice as fast as our own, totaling $160 billion in 2018,"" a spokesman for Amazon said.
A Justice Department spokesman declined to say on Tuesday which companies it would scrutinize under the antitrust probe, but said the review would consider concerns raised about ""search, social media, and some retail services online"" - an apparent reference to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), and potentially Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
Mnuchin also said the small amount of work that Google does with the Chinese government did not raise any concerns, despite President Donald Trump's calls last week for his administration to investigate the issue.
""The president did look into that as well as I,"" Mnuchin said. ""Google is an American company who wants to help the U.S."""

Six Flags reported earnings of $0.94 per share for the quarter, down from $0.88 per share a year earlier, missing estimates compiled by Investing.com for earnings of $0.99 a share. Revenue of $477.2 million beat estimates of $469.9 million.
Shares of Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) tumbled about 6%. 
The uptick in revenue, driven by increased attendance, sponsorship and international agreements, was offset by two months of additional expenses for the five parks the company added in June 2018.
Total guest spending per head slid 1% as admissions per head fell 2%, while in-park guest spending gained 1%.
Some on Wall Street, however, continue to back the company.
“With more up-selling to higher-priced memberships, we see continued traction in the Active Pass membership (up 25% year-on-year),” CFRA, an independent research firm, said in a note to clients. CFRA maintained its hold rating and $56 price target. Overall, the consensus 12-month estimate on the stock is $59.42, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 05:16PM ET</span>","Diageo fails to reach pay deal with Scottish unions, faces strikes","By Siddharth Cavale
LONDON (Reuters) - Talks over pay between  Diageo  Plc (L:DGE) and two of its biggest Scottish unions fell apart on Wednesday, threatening the production of some the region's most popular whiskies.
Members of Scotland's Unite and GMB unions, who make up more than half of Diageo's 3,500 Scottish workforce, will ballot workers for strike action after rejecting on Wednesday an offer to increase pay by 2.8%. Last week, the unions rejected a 2.5% pay raise.
Diageo is the maker of whiskies including Johnnie Walker, Black & White, Lagavulin and Talisker. It has 29 distilleries in Scotland and most of the whisky it produces there is exported to 180 countries around the world.
""During these talks it soon became clear that no progress would be made because the company have attempted to repackage the pay offer making it appear more generous,"" Unite's regional industrial officer, Bob McGregor, said.
""The reality is that the latest offer is just as insulting as the previous one, and our members won’t be conned or denied what they deserve,"" he said in an email.
Unite said that 500 of its workers at Diageo's Cameron Bridge, Leven and Shieldhall sites would be balloted to take strike actions from next week. The union also warned of ""discontinuous strike action"" likely to last from late August to November.
GMB was not immediately available for comment.
""Despite improving our offer, the unions did not move from their position to enable meaningful discussions to take place,"" a Diageo spokeswoman said.
""We remain committed to seeking a resolution and ensuring our employees receive an increase on their pay ... we have well developed contingency plans in place in the event of any strike action,” she said.
Shares of Diageo closed down 1.6% at 3,353.50 pence on Wednesday. The company is expected to report half-year earnings on Thursday."
1570,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 05:04PM ET</span>",Facebook to pay record $5 billion U.S. fine over privacy violations; critics call it a bargain,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) will pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine to resolve a government probe into its privacy practices and will boost safeguards on user data, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the social media company said on Wednesday.
After the stock market closed, Facebook disclosed as a part of its earnings report that the FTC told it last month that the commission had opened a separate antitrust investigation of the company. The FTC, which early in the day issued a statement and held a press conference about the privacy settlement, did not mention an antitrust probe.
The FTC probe that resulted in the $5 billion settlement uncovered a wide range of privacy issues. It was triggered last year by allegations that Facebook violated a 2012 consent decree by inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The consultancy's clients included President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.
The FTC voted 3-2 to adopt the settlement, which the three Republican commissioners called the settlement ""a complete home run"" that exceeded any possible court award. Both Democratic commissioners said it did not go far enough or require a large enough fine. The settlement requires court approval.
Republican FTC Chairman Joe Simons stressed the FTC's limited authority and desire to avoid a long court fight.
""Would it have been nice to get more, to get $10 billion, instead of $5 billion for example, to get greater restrictions on how Facebook collects uses and shares data?"" he asked at a press conference. ""We did not have those options. We cannot impose such things by our own fiat.""
Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra complained that the penalty provided ""blanket immunity"" for Facebook executives ""and no real restraints on Facebook's business model"" and does ""not fix the core problems that led to these violations"" or limit Facebook's ability to collect data.
Facebook confirmed it would pay the $5 billion fine and said the settlement would provide ""a comprehensive new framework for protecting people's privacy."" Its shares closed about 1% higher.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Facebook agreed to pay an additional $100 million to settle allegations that it misled investors about the seriousness of its misuse of users' data.
Under the settlement, Facebook's board will create an independent privacy committee that removes ""unfettered control by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over decisions affecting user privacy.""
Facebook also agreed to exercise greater oversight over third-party apps, and said it was ending access to friend data for  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Corp (T:6758). 
The Republican FTC majority said the settlement ""significantly diminishes Mr. Zuckerberg's power -- something no government agency, anywhere in the world, has thus far accomplished.""
Under the deal, Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives must sign quarterly certifications attesting to privacy practices. The FTC said a false certification could result in civil and criminal penalties. 
Facebook also is barred from asking for email passwords to other services when consumers sign up. It is barred from using telephone numbers for advertising if they are obtained in a security feature like two-factor authentication. The company must also get user consent to use facial recognition data. 
Facebook said it may find additional problems as it initiates a review of its systems and warned it will take longer to roll out updates.
In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg said"" ""we're bringing our privacy controls more in line with our financial controls."" He added that when features are added or modified, ""we’ll have to document any risks and the steps we're taking to mitigate them.""
The FTC also said that Cambridge Analytica's former CEO Alexander Nix and former app developer Aleksandr Kogan had agreed to a settlement restricting how they conduct business.
Several lawmakers criticized the settlement. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called it ""a fig leaf"" that offers ""no accountability for top executives.""
""By relying on a monetary fine to deter Facebook, the FTC has failed to heed history’s lessons. Facebook has already written this penalty down as a one-time-cost in return for the extraordinary profits reaped from a decade of data misuse,"" said Blumenthal, a Democrat.
Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri also criticized the deal, saying it ""does nothing to hold executives accountable. It utterly fails to penalize Facebook in any effective way.""
Facebook confirmed that marketing vice president Michel Protti had been nominated to be chief privacy officer for product but under the settlement he must be approved by the new board committee overseeing privacy.
Other legal issues loom. On Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms into whether they engage in anticompetitive practices. The department did not specify Facebook or any other company but cited concerns raised about ""search, social media, and some retail services online.""
Leaders in those areas include Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook and possibly Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
FTC DECIDED TO SETTLE PROBE
The Democrats on the FTC complained that the $5 billion penalty may be less than Facebook's gains from violating users' privacy. ""Until we address Facebook's core financial incentives for risking our personal privacy and national security, we will not be able to prevent these problems from happening again,"" Chopra said.
The other Democratic commissioner, Rebecca Slaughter, said the FTC should have taken Facebook and Zuckerberg to court. She also criticized the FTC's decision to grant Facebook and its executives a release from liability for any claims that prior to June 12, 2019 it violated the earlier FTC settlement.
Slaughter said the FTC failed ""to impose any substantive restrictions on Facebook's collection and use of data from or about users.""

Chopra said the settlement means ""the commission -- and the public -- may never find out what Facebook knows... It is difficult to conclude that the commission got the better end of the bargain.""

The automaker reported a loss of $1.12 per share on revenue of $6.35 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had forecast a loss of $0.41 a share on revenue of $6.52 billion.
Tesla shares lost about 10% following the report. The shares are down more than 20% this year.
The company said it was simplifying its guidance for investors and did not offer any prediction on profit or revenue looking ahead, but the company did say it still expected to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year.
Tesla said at the start of the month it delivered 95,200 vehicles in the second quarter.
“We continue to aim for positive GAAP net income in Q3 and the following quarters, although continuous volume growth, capacity expansion and cash generation will remain the main focus,"" the company said. ""Our 2019 capex is expected to be about $1.5 to $2.0 billion, a reduction from prior guidance.”
Striving to improve margins and post a profit later this year, Tesla has laid off workers and pledged to close some stores to lower costs. It has also tinkered with its pricing and dropped some model variants in recent months.
The company also said it was looking to produce 10,000 vehicles of all models per week by the end of 2019.
Tesla made good on Musk's promise of delivering record number of electric cars in the second quarter, citing improved logistics system, and temporarily quelling fears about demand for its cars.

Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN) jumped 7.4% after the company hinted that a global slowdown in microchip demand would not be as long as feared, powering the Philadelphia chip (SOX) index up 3.1% to a record high.
""Semiconductor investors are looking past right now and saying that maybe in the second half of this year, economic concerns will start to abate a little,"" said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
However, trade-sensitive Caterpillar Inc (N:CAT) dropped 4.5% following disappointing earnings on weak sales in China and higher production and restructuring costs.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) fell 3.1% after the world's largest planemaker posted its largest-ever quarterly loss on the back of this year's grounding of its best-selling 737 MAX after two deadly crashes.

Overall earnings per share, however, are now expected to fall 0.1%, compared with a prior estimate of a rise of about 1%.
Wall Street has hit record levels in July on bets the Federal Reserve will lower rates next week to counter the impact of a protracted U.S.-China trade war on economic growth. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) dipped 0.29% to end at 27,269.97 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.47% to 3,019.56.

The Russell 2000 small cap index (RUT) jumped 1.64% to its highest close since early May. That suggests investors have grown more confident in the U.S. economy, Delwiche said.
For the year, the S&P 500 is now up 20%, while the Nasdaq has gained 25%.

Another bright spot on Wednesday was  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), up 8.7% and among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 index, after the world's biggest package delivery company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

MADRID (Reuters) - Amancio Ortega, Europe's richest man and founder of retailer  Inditex  (MC:ITX), had commercial property assets worth nearly 10 billion euros ($11 billion) at the end of 2018, up 11.5 percent from the previous year according to his investment firm on Wednesday.
Using the huge dividend payouts from Inditex, octogenarian Ortega has made largely debt-free purchases of buildings ranging from prime shopping real estate in London and New York to office buildings in central Madrid.
Most of Ortega's commercial holdings have been consolidated into a company called Pontegadea Inversiones which owns a 50.01 percent stake in Inditex alongside billions of euros in real estate investments.
Pontegadea's annual results showed real estate assets of 9.767 billion euros at the end of 2018.
Earlier this year, Pontegadea completed the purchase of two Seattle office blocks, currently leased to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), in the Spanish fund's biggest ever deal in the United States.
Pontegadea carried out real estate investments to the tune of 416 million euros during 2018 in addition to the purchase of 9.99 percent of Spanish telecommunications infrastructure company Telxius for 378 million euros, Pontegadea said.
Stripping out the Inditex shareholding, Pontegadea's revenues, mostly related to real estate activity, increased 5.2 percent on year in 2018 to 405 million euros.

1581,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>",Growth warnings roils Facebook shares,"Investing.com - Facebook shares jumped nearly 5% after hours and then tumbled quickly after its chief financial officer warned that revenue growth could decelerate in coming quarters.
The warning came after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reported earnings that topped expectations thanks to better-than-expected average user spend in the second quarter.
The social-media giant's shares were briefly off as much as 20% but then mostly recovered. At 5:45 p.m., the shares were off 0.6%.
The selling was prompted when Chief Financial Officer David Wehner forecast the “deceleration” in the company’s revenue growth by “high single-digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially” in the third and fourth quarters of this year, the San Jose Mercury-News reported. Wehner said the reasons for expected growth deceleration include currency headwinds, Facebook’s experimentation in new technologies like Stories, and giving users more choices on privacy.
The disclosure came after Facebook reported earnings per share of $1.99 on revenue of $16.89 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $1.87 on revenue of $16.5 billion. That compared with EPS of $1.74 on revenue of $13.23 billion in the same period a year earlier. The company had reported EPS of $0.85 on revenue of $15.08 billion in the previous quarter.
The better-than-expected results were bolstered by an increase in average user spend, a key performance metric.
Average revenue per user rose to $7.05, above forecasts of $6.87. Daily and monthly active users, meanwhile, were in-line with forecasts at 1.59 billion and 2.41 billion, respectively, for the quarter.
Facebook also revealed that it was informed by the Federal Trade Commission in June that the agency had opened an antitrust probe into the company. The company reached a settlement with the FTC of $5 billion and agreed to significantly enhance its practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight.
""In particular, we have agreed to implement a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program, including substantial management and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, and a process to regularly certify our compliance with 2 the privacy program to the FTC,"" Facebook said in its earnings report. ""In the second quarter of 2019, we recorded an additional $2.0 billion accrual in connection with our settlement with the FTC, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet.""
Against the backdrop of increased regulatory scrutiny into Facebook's data privacy practices, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would continue to invest to beef up privacy protection on its social media platforms.
""We had a strong quarter and our business and community continue to grow,"" Zuckerberg said. ""We are investing in building stronger privacy protections for everyone and on delivering new experiences for the people who use our services."""

Money fund assets grew by $28.94 billion to $3.240 trillion in the week ended July 23, their highest level since the week of Jan. 12, 2010, when they totaled $3.251 trillion.
Despite Wall Street hovering at record highs, some investors have been withdrawing money from domestic stock funds, totaling some $58 billion year-to-date.
Conflicts between the United States and its trading partners and worries about a slowing global economy have led some investors to favor cash-like vehicles which are yielding about 2% - comparable to the yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries notes (US10YT=RR).
Since the end of 2018, investors have poured $269 billion into money funds.
In the latest week, taxable money fund assets rose by $30.23 billion to $3.103 trillion, which was the highest since the week of Aug. 4, 2009 when they stood at $3.111 trillion, according to the report, published by iMoneyNet.
Tax-free fund assets fell by $1.29 billion to $137.64 billion.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day simple yield for taxable money funds dipped to 1.96% from 1.97% a week ago. The weighted average maturity among taxable funds was unchanged at 30 days.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day yield for tax-free and municipal funds rose to 0.90% from last week's 0.86%, which the lowest since last August. The weighted average maturity of tax-free funds was unchanged at 29 days.

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 02:17PM ET</span>",MAX jetliner grounding crisis pushes Boeing to biggest-ever loss,"By Eric M. Johnson and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) posted its largest-ever quarterly loss on Wednesday due to the spiraling cost of resolving issues with its 737 MAX, warning it may have to shut production of the grounded jet completely if it runs into new hurdles with global regulators getting its best-selling aircraft back in the air.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said he was confident the MAX would be back in service as early as October, but acknowledged for the first time that Boeing may have to slow or completely halt production of the 737 MAX, a step it has not had to resort to on any commercial plane for more than 20 years.
The world's largest planemaker also reported a fresh delay on its 777X widebody program as  General Electric  Co (N:GE) engine problems pushed the first flight into 2020.
Boeing is looking to restore customers' faith in its 737 MAX and to satisfy the requirements of regulators by reprogramming the software pinpointed as a common factor in two deadly crashes in the span of five months.
""This is a defining moment for Boeing,"" Muilenburg told analysts. He said Boeing has held weekly technical calls and a number of conferences with MAX operators around the world and nearly 225 sessions in flight simulators testing its software. 
Muilenburg's comments came after the company posted its largest-ever quarterly loss, diving nearly $3 billion into the red while burning $1.01 billion in cash in the quarter. 
Investors shrugged off the large loss after Boeing announced heavy charges last week, bringing the total cost so far of the 737 MAX crisis to more than $8 billion, mainly due to compensation the planemaker will have to pay airlines for the delayed deliveries and lower production.
Boeing's shares dipped only slightly after second-quarter results were announced, but slipped 3 percent after Muilenburg's comments on the possibility of lowering production further, or stopping it temporarily.
Chicago-based Boeing has been unable to deliver any 737 MAX aircraft since the single-aisle plane was grounded worldwide in March after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. 
Click here to view an interactive graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2MaWqTt.
PRODUCTION CUTS POSSIBLE
Muilenburg said the company would consider further 737 output cuts below the current rate of 42 aircraft per month, or potentially suspending production if warranted - a step Boeing has not taken since 1997 when it halted 747 production and delayed introduction of a new 737 so suppliers could catch up.
Boeing reduced the number of single-aisle aircraft it produces monthly in the Seattle area to 42 from 52 after the second crash in Ethiopia while suspending deliveries to airlines, cutting off a key source of cash and hitting margins.
The lower rate means Boeing has to pay more for parts, which are priced according to the volume Boeing buys. Boeing said it was working toward building 57 of the 737s a month in 2020. 
Boeing also faces issues with other planes. It said its first flight of the 777X - the latest iteration of its popular long-range twin-aisle aircraft - is now delayed until early 2020 due to the engine problems announced last month, while its current plan for a first delivery to customers in late 2020 faced significant risk. 
The 777-9, the larger of two new jets in the 777 family, was initially scheduled for first flight in the fourth quarter of 2018 with delivery to the first customer in the second quarter of 2020, according to a Boeing certification plan seen by Reuters. 
Boeing would have to sell more 777 freighters to avoid a slowdown in output caused by 777X delays, but Muilenburg pointed to what he called ""strong demand signals"" despite global trade tensions. 
NEW MID-MARKET PLANE? 
The grounding of the 737 MAX has sent shockwaves through the industry and also pushed back the launch of a new Boeing aircraft, a twin-aisle jet for the middle of the market. 
That jetliner, known as NMA, is not just a crucial piece in Boeing's fight with archrival Airbus (PA:AIR) in the lucrative longer-haul market but also lays foundations for the eventual development of a 737 replacement, industry sources have said. 
Muilenburg said the company is making progress on building the business case for NMA, but getting the MAX flying commercially remains its ""top priority.""
""We're not going to run to any artificial timeline,"" Muilenburg said, referring to a decision whether to launch the aircraft. 
Boeing said free cash flow fell to a negative $1.01 billion in the quarter, the first full quarter of operations since the MAX was banned commercially, though that was narrower than the negative $2.09 billion analysts had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
'COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE'
Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts the 737 MAX compensation to airlines could hurt cash flow in 2019 and beyond, and said Boeing will continue to ""diligently review all levers available"" to minimize the financial impact. 
Industry sources say the company has already embarked on cost cuts across the board.
Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said in a note, however, that Boeing's results ""could have been worse."" 
""Although the headline numbers for 2Q look pretty grim, they are not as bad as we had been forecasting,"" he said.
The company said it would issue a new 2019 outlook at a future date. It suspended giving any 2019 guidance in April.
Boeing's net loss for the second quarter was $2.94 billion, compared with a profit of $2.20 billion, a year earlier. 
Sales slipped 35% to $15.75 billion and also came in below the average estimate of $18.55 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Global airlines have had to cancel thousands of flights and use spare aircraft to cover routes that were previously flown with the fuel-efficient MAX, eating into their profitability.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgian prosecutors charged TBC Bank Group's (L:TBCG) chairman and his deputy on Wednesday with money laundering, a move the bankers said was absurd and damaged prospects for attracting investment to the country.
Mamuka Khazaradze, chairman of the group that owns Georgia's biggest retail bank and also a prominent government critic, and his deputy Badri Japaridze were charged with ""laundering illegal revenues worth over $16.75 million,"" prosecutors said.
TBC Bank JSC, the corporate division of TBC Bank Group, was investigated this year by the National Bank of Georgia, or central bank, and the office of public prosecution over transactions that took place in 2007 and 2008.
Khazaradze said in February he had been forced to quit his additional role as chairman of TBC Bank JSC due to government pressure.
TBC, which is listed in London, said the two executives were no longer involved in day-to-day management and said there was no suggestion charges would be brought against TBC or its units.
""These charges have nothing in common with money laundering,"" Zviad Kordzadze, the lawyer representing both executives, told reporters, dismissing the accusations.
Khazaradze, who said this month he planned to set up a civil movement that analysts say could be turned into a political party before a parliamentary election in 2020, called the charges against him and his colleague ""absurd"".
""This is an orchestrated attack on us, ... but they harm Georgia's investment climate,"" he said after leaving the prosecutor's office, adding that the bank's reputation and investor confidence was being damaged.
Khazaradze founded TBC Bank in 1992, according to the TBC Bank Group website.
The bank's London-listed shares fell 11% on Wednesday.
Japaridze said TBC Bank Group would not be deterred from implementing projects it was working on, including building a deep-sea port in Anaklia on Georgia's Black Sea coast. The Anaklia project, worth $2.5 billion, has U.S. support.
The government of the former Soviet state sparked protests last month for inviting a Russian lawmaker to address parliament. Russia briefly invaded Georgia 11 years ago and the opposition accuse the government of not standing up to Moscow.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Caterpillar  Inc's (N:CAT) earnings on Wednesday missed Wall Street's estimates, hurt by a combination of weak sales in China and higher production and restructuring costs, sending its shares lower.
The heavy equipment maker said its full-year earnings are expected to be at the lower end of its earlier forecast.
The Deerfield, Illinois-based company, a proxy for global economic activity, benefited in the past year from the strongest global growth since 2010. However, a tariff war between the United States and trade partners including China has sapped business confidence, dampening economic activity.
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday lowered its forecast for global growth this year and next, its fourth downgrade since October.
Caterpillar said while some of its customers are turning more circumspect in making large capital expenditures, overall demand remains positive.
""We continue to expect modest sales growth for the year,"" Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby told analysts on an earnings call.
The sales outlook is driven mainly by an expected ramp-up in demand for mining machines and solar turbines.
In a worry for the company, sales of construction machines in China declined, dragged down by slowing economic activity and competitive pricing.
The world's second-largest economy accounts for up to 15% of Caterpillar's construction equipment sales. It is facing competition from local Chinese players trying to chip away at its market share through aggressive pricing.
The company said it was looking to counter the competition with new products rather than price cuts.
Profit in the June quarter suffered because of $110 million in restructuring costs, as well as a $328 million increase in manufacturing costs due to higher raw material prices, including a $70 million tariff bill.
Caterpillar still expects the tariffs to cost the company between $250 million and $350 million this year. But it said input prices are moderating and freight costs have stabilized.
Restructuring costs are also projected to be significantly lower in the second half of the year.
Some analysts have warned that more than half of Caterpillar's end markets have already peaked or will peak this year, which could translate into lower earnings next year.
The world's largest heavy-duty equipment maker experienced the longest downturn in its history when sales dropped more than 40% between 2012 and 2016.
Chastised by the sales slump, the company has been spending money on expanding its services and parts business, which has higher margins and is less cyclical. It is aiming to increase services revenue to $28 billion by 2026, up from $18 billion in 2018 and double what it was in 2016.
In the second quarter, Caterpillar reported net income of $1.62 billion, or $2.83 per share, compared with $1.71 billion, or $2.82 per share, a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, expected earnings of $3.11 per share.
The company retained its 2019 earnings outlook of $12.06-$13.06 per share, but said profit is expected be at the lower end of the forecast.

Its shares were down 4.5% at $131.95 on Wednesday afternoon, weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI).

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 01:59PM ET</span>",EBay to launch warehousing and shipping service next year,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - EBay Inc (O:EBAY) said on Wednesday it would launch a warehousing and shipping service for merchants selling through its site starting next year, a new strategy that is expected to attract more sellers to the e-commerce platform.
The program is currently in trial in the United States and Germany and is similar to Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) ""Fulfillment By Amazon"" service, or FBA, which allows merchants to rent space in warehouses worldwide so they can store inventory closer to customers.
It is poised to help eBay ship products faster, increasingly a key consideration of shoppers when they browse for items online. EBay sellers send about 1.5 million packages daily in the United States.
EBay, based in San Jose, California, held the mantle of being the top online destination for sellers before Amazon's marketplace gained traction over a decade ago with the help of FBA. That gave the Seattle company far more control over the shipping process.
While EBay long resisted growing its logistics footprint, Amazon raised the stakes further this April, announcing it would halve delivery times to one day via its loyalty club Prime, a service that costs U.S. members $119 per year. At the same time, improved logistics networks and high warehouse capacity made a delivery service more feasible for eBay.
Devin Wenig, eBay's chief executive, said the company was targeting free two-day shipping under the program.
""What this is not about is us trying to win a fast shipping war,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""Our 182 million consumers shop on eBay because of the value and uniqueness of our inventory. We’re not the one-hour delivery guys. We're never going to be that, but consumer expectations are changing.""
Some 40% to 50% of items on eBay will qualify, while the company can offer its guaranteed three-day delivery program announced in 2017 for the remainder, Wenig said.
Wenig did not discuss how much eBay would spend on the service, known as ""Managed Delivery,"" but he said it can be a profitable business on its own right.
Sellers in the program will be charged a fee for warehousing and for shipping once an item is sold. The service will let them fulfill orders placed on eBay or on other online platforms, the company said.

(Reuters) - U.S. oilfield supplier National Oilwell Varco Inc (N:NOV) is trimming its workforce, according to people familiar with the matter, as oil and gas customers have cut spending on services and equipment.
The company recently began offering voluntary early retirement to eligible employees, three people said. Any discussion of workforce cuts would be part of its second-quarter earnings call next week, said a spokesman for the Houston-based company, who declined to comment further.
Although global oil prices have rebounded from the market's 2014-16 downturn, profits at the service companies that provide drilling and well-completion services have not recovered to the same extent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors edged into the U.S. stock market last week, as the benchmark S&P 500 index hovered near record highs, by adding $1.1 billion into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold domestic stocks, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute.
The $1.1 billion was the lowest weekly amount of positive inflows since late February and was less than half the roughly $2.4 billion investors sent into U.S. stocks the week before.
For the year to date, investors have pulled nearly $58 billion out of domestic stock funds even as the S&P 500 continues to hit record peaks. The benchmark index is up nearly 20% since the beginning of the year, thanks in part to expectations of at least one equity-friendly interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year.
Instead, investors continued to rush into bonds by sending $11.1 billion into taxable and municipal debt funds. That continued a streak of positive inflows over every full week for the year to date which has garnered nearly $245 billion into the category.
World stock funds, meanwhile, continued to leak assets by losing $1.8 billion in outflows, extending an 8-week losing streak. Over the year to date, world stock funds have dropped $19.5 billion in outflows."

BMW said it was investing $10 million in a new battery assembly line which will be capable of operating in a two shift system ahead of the introduction of the BMW X3 plug in hybrid vehicle by the end of the year.
BMW made 15,000 batteries last year with a one shift system and currently produces a plug-in hybrid version of the X5 offroader. A new version of the X5 will be produced at the Spartanburg plant from August onwards, the company said.
BMW said it planned to employ 120 staff to manufacture different types of batteries, and the additional staff gave it the capacity to double production.
In the past four years BMW workers assembled 45,000 batteries, the carmaker said."
1605,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 10:52AM ET</span>",Big Tech faces broad U.S. Justice Department antitrust probe,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms into whether they engage in anticompetitive practices, the strongest sign the Trump administration is stepping up its scrutiny of Big Tech.
The review will look into ""whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers,"" the Justice Department said in a statement.
The Justice Department did not identify specific companies but said the review would consider concerns raised about ""search, social media, and some retail services online"" -- an apparent reference to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), and potentially Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
A Justice Department spokesman declined to provide a list of companies that would be scrutinized.
Google and Apple declined to comment, referring to prior statements by executives, while Facebook and Amazon did not immediately comment.
Facebook fell 1.7% in after-hours trading, while Alphabet fell 1%, Amazon was down 1.2% and Apple was 0.4% lower.
The announcement comes a day before the Federal Trade Commission is set to announce a $5 billion penalty to Facebook for failing to properly protect user privacy.
Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said the Justice Department ""must now be bold and fearless in stopping Big Tech’s misuse of its monopolistic power. Too long absent and apathetic, enforcers now must prevent privacy abuse, anticompetitive tactics, innovation roadblocks, and other hallmarks of excessive market power.""
In June, Reuters reported the Trump administration was gearing up to investigate whether Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet's Google misuse their massive market power, setting up what could be an unprecedented, wide-ranging probe of some of the world’s largest companies.
A person briefed on the matter said the Justice review may also include some state attorneys general.
The Justice Department said the review ""is to assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want.""
Reuters reported on May 31 that the Justice Department was preparing an investigation of Google to determine whether the tech giant broke antitrust law.
Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill alike are expressing growing concerns about the size of the largest tech firms and their market power. Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook and unwinding prior acquisitions.
Last week, the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel pressed executives from the four firms about their competitive practices and noted that Google, Facebook, Amazon had a rising share of key markets.
Congress held a series of hearings last year looking at the dominance of major tech companies and their role in displacing or swallowing up existing businesses. It is rare for the government to seek to undo a consummated deal. The most famous case in recent memory is the government’s effort to break up  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact.
""There is growing consensus among venture capitalists and startups that there is a kill zone around Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple that prevents new startups from entering the market with innovative products and services to challenge these incumbents,"" said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat who heads the subcommittee.
Apple CEO Tim Cook told CBS News last month that scrutiny was fair but ""if you look at any kind of measure about is Apple a monopoly or not, I don't think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion that Apple's a monopoly. Our share is much more modest. We don't have a dominant position in any market.""
Google's Adam Cohen told the House Judiciary subcommittee last week that the company had ""created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals.""
Technology companies face a backlash in the United States and across the world, fueled by concerns among competitors, lawmakers and consumer groups that they have too much power and are harming users and business rivals.
U.S. President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of social media companies and Google, accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co's self-driving unit, Cruise, said on Wednesday it was delaying the commercial deployment of cars past its target of 2019 as more testing of the vehicles was required.
Cruise Chief Executive Officer Dan Ammann said the company would expand testing in San Francisco https://medium.com/cruise/the-next-steps-to-scale-start-in-san-francisco-713315f3a142, and added in a blog post that Cruise was working with Honda Motor Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to develop purpose-built autonomous vehicles. 
Ammann did not say when the company now expects to deploy a ride-hailing service using self-driving vehicles. It had earlier hoped to deploy such a service https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-selfdriving/gm-faces-pushback-on-u-s-self-driving-vehicle-plan-idUSKCN1SS2TQ by the end of 2019, but in April, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra declined to repeat that goal.
Cruise has raised $7.25 billion during the past year from investors including SoftBank, Honda Motor Co and investment firm T. Rowe Price. As GM and Cruise executives have done in the past, Ammann said Cruise would launch its commercial service when it was sure the vehicles would be safe.
""When you’re working on the large scale deployment of mission critical safety systems, the mindset of 'move fast and break things' certainly doesn’t cut it,"" Ammann wrote in a post on Medium on Wednesday.
Ammann alluded in his post to broader concerns about the trustworthiness of ""Big Tech"" and said Cruise was in talks with regulators about how to measure when its technology ""will have a net positive impact on safety on our roads."" 
Cruise's decision to formally postpone deployment of self-driving cars this year comes as rival autonomous vehicle companies and automakers acknowledge it will take more time and money than they had expected to make autonomous vehicles safe for unrestricted use on public roads. 
The capital and technology challenges of self-driving cars are pushing automakers to forge alliances to share the cost burdens. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co earlier this month said they would partner to develop autonomous vehicles, and invest in self-driving technology company Argo AI. German automakers BMW AG and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) also have struck self-driving car partnerships. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo robo-taxi unit has begun offering rides for hire in Arizona, but continues to operate its vehicles with human attendants ready to take the wheel.
Ammann, who took over as Cruise's chief executive last November, told Reuters last year that developing self-driving cars capable of safely navigating urban traffic was ""the engineering challenge of our generation."" 
Against what promises to be a long period of development and technology evolution, initial delays would not be that meaningful, he said.
Cruise is working with GM and Honda engineers to develop a next-generation of electric, autonomous vehicles, Ammann said.
""This is not a concept car — hundreds of the best Honda, GM and Cruise engineers are working together on-site in Warren, Michigan, where they are deep into the vehicle development process. This new vehicle completely reimagines from the ground up what a car can be and we can’t wait to share more in the near future,"" Ammann wrote.
GM has sought clearance from federal safety regulators for self-driving cars that do not have conventional controls such as a steering wheel. The U.S. Department of Transportation has delayed action on GM's petition to test such vehicles for more than a year, and earlier this year said it would seek public comments on the proposal.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T) exceeded analyst expectations on Wednesday for net wireless subscribers who pay a monthly bill, as it eked out some growth in a saturated market and continued to bundle media content from Time Warner into new wireless plans.
But the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers lost more premium TV subscribers than the previous quarter as viewers moved to streaming services like Netflix Inc (O:NFLX). 
AT&T lost 778,000 premium TV subscribers, a category that includes DirecTV satellite and U-verse television customers, much more than the 544,000 lost in the first quarter. The company also lost 168,000 streaming DirecTV Now accounts. AT&T said it expects a similar level of video losses to continue in the current quarter. 
Still, it added a net 72,000 phone subscribers, beating analyst estimates for 27,000, according to research firm FactSet. 
Postpaid phone churn, or the rate of customer defections, was 0.86%, up from 0.82% in the previous year. 
Shares of the company were up 2.1% at $32.77.
AT&T closed its $85-billion acquisition of media company Time Warner in June last year, creating a new business segment called WarnerMedia to house assets including the Turner TV networks and premium channel HBO. 
The new WarnerMedia segment, which includes Turner and premium TV channel HBO, reported revenue of $8.4 billion, against analyst expectations for $8.3 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company said WarnerMedia's new streaming service HBO Max is slated to launch in spring of 2020.
AT&T has been focused on paying down its debt after the purchase of Time Warner, which pushed its net debt load to about $180 billion last year. 
The company spent $6.8 billion on paying off the debt in the second quarter, and said it was on track to cut its net debt load to about $150 billion by the end of the year.
AT&T also raised its free cash flow guidance for 2019 to around $28 billion.
""The debt we have will be at a very reasonable place as we exit this year, (and) I fully expect that we'll be buying some stocks back as we go on this year and (expect) cash flows to continue,"" Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said in a conference call with analysts. 
He also said that AT&T strategy will not be impacted by the result of the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint for the next three years. The Department of Justice is expected to make a decision on the merger this week.
Total operating revenue in the second quarter rose 15.3% to $44.96 billion. Analysts were expecting $44.85 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net income attributable to AT&T fell to $3.71 billion, or 51 cents per share, from $5.13 billion, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, AT&T earned 89 cents per share, in line with estimates.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Unilever  (L:ULVR),  Tesco  (L:TSCO) and Nestlé (S:NESN) are among the best prepared to capitalize on the trend for plant-based meat substitutes, according to a report from an investor group managing $5 trillion in assets.   
    The report by the Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR) coalition showed 25 major retailers and manufacturers were developing strategies for sustainable protein products, recognizing the risk of a strategy reliant on animal protein.
    ""Many have now begun a journey to diversify the protein products away from being predominantly animal-based, and towards low carbon and less resource intensive sources that are plant-based,"" said Jeremy Coller, founder of FAIRR, which includes institutions such as UBS (S:UBSG) and  Schroders  (L:SDR).
Unilever, Tesco and Nestle were awarded top rankings for their work in understanding the impact and reducing risks associated with intensive animal agriculture, such as the emission of greenhouse gas.
They were also among the firms that had strong sustainable sourcing programs and had targets to reduce emissions, said Aarti Ramachandran, FAIRR's head of research and engagement.
The report, titled ""Appetite for Disruption"", found 87% of retailers were increasing their own-brand plant-based products, while 64% of the 25 firms that FAIRR engaged with had referred to ""vegan"" and ""plant-based"" in their annual reports.
The alternative protein market has taken off in part due to the inclusion of such products at global restaurant chains such as Burger King (TO:QSR) and McDonalds Corp (N:MCD), as well as the blockbuster listing of  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND).
The alternative protein market is now valued at $19.5 billion and is expected to capture 10% of global meat market, the report said, citing research from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). The market is expected to reach $100 billion in value in 15 years.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) fared lower in the rankings and were described as ""reactive"" in part because of their limited work in sustainable sourcing of animal protein.
While manufacturers were expanding alternative protein portfolios, 56% of those companies were responding to consumer demand rather than taking a more proactive approach.
""We can't tackle climate change ... unless food companies more rapidly diversify their protein portfolios away from animal agriculture,"" Coller said.
Only four companies had undertaken a risk assessment to stress test the resilience of their protein supply chain, FAIRR’s report said."

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 10:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russia's finance ministry seeks delay of Basel III reform - letter,"By Tatiana Voronova and Darya Korsunskaya
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has asked the central bank to postpone reforms requiring banks to increase capital buffers under the ""Basel III"" international financial rules, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The request for the delay focuses on disagreement about how the banks' risks are assessed, with the central bank saying it will do in-house assessment and the finance ministry arguing it should be based on ratings by domestic agencies.
Siluanov's request, which had not been previously reported, comes at a time of broader tension between the Russian government and central bank over the banking sector and tools for aiding economic growth.
The central bank's priority is stability of the financial system, but ministers are worried that economic growth - and households' real disposable incomes - is stagnating, hitting the Russian leadership's ratings.
Some ministers have been pressing the central bank to change the way it supervises banks to encourage more lending which will in turn contribute to growth.
The move to increase banks' capital buffers - part of the Basel III rules developed after the financial crisis of 2008-09 - is likely to have the effect of holding down lending, the chief executive of Russia's second bank has said.
In the letter dated July 17, Siluanov wrote to central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina saying the introduction of the higher capital buffers in line with the Basel III changes should be tied to the introduction of domestic ratings for the banks.
""We have in mind a postponement of the increase in additions to the requirements of the banks' capital adequacy,"" Siluanov wrote.
Under the central bank's proposals, banks are already increasing capital buffers as part of the Basel III process and should fully comply during the next couple of years.
No government officials have said how long it would take before domestic ratings can be used as the basis for Basel III changes.
A Finance Ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to discuss non-public correspondence, confirmed the authenticity of the letter.
CENBANK SEES LENDING OPPORTUNITIES
In an emailed response to Reuters, the central bank said preliminary data shows that its risk assessment would allow the freeing up of banking capital across the system and ""give additional opportunities for lending to the real economy sector... in the nearest future.""
""At the same time, the central bank continues work to create conditions for national rating agencies' ratings usage in the banking supervision in the future,"" the central bank said.
Officially, the Finance Ministry declined comment on the letter.
Reuters has not been able to establish which of the rival methods of assessing risk would result in banks having to increase their capital buffers more.
However, Russia's domestic ratings, whose active development started only a couple of years ago, lack deep statistics on defaults and cover a limited number of companies, said Ekaterina Trofimova, a partner at Deloitte CIS and former head of Russian ratings agency ACRA.
""In these conditions, it's only possible to apply a combination of the two methods, with a multi-year transition period to the approach of using ratings,"" Trofimova said.
In his letter to Nabiullina, Siluanov argued that using rating agencies would produce a better outcome.
He said that under the Basel III changes proposed by the central bank, banks may try to mislead the regulator on their asset quality, seeking to reduce the amount by which they are forced to increase their capital buffers.
""ACCUMULATION OF RISKS""
Siluanov also said the requirement being planned by the central bank under the Basel III reforms for a borrower to have publicly traded instruments was unacceptable, as the three banking groups the central bank had to rescue back in 2017 were on paper meeting that requirement.
""Implementation of the method announced (by the central bank) ... may lead to the accumulation of risks to financial stability and in the end to the direct losses for society's prosperity,"" Siluanov wrote.
The central bank and some parts of the government are already at odds over economic growth, as the central bank is targeting inflation and opposing the finance ministry's idea to start spending a rainy-day fund.
Since Basel III calls for setting aside more funds to form the enlarged capital, the banks have repeatedly asked the central bank to postpone the switch to the new rules.
Andrey Kostin, the powerful CEO of state-owned VTB (MM:VTBR), has called for domestic ratings to be used when evaluating a borrower's risk, saying they more fairly represent the reality.
For VTB alone, Basel III means increase of the capital by 450 billion roubles. The bank has already partially beefed up its capital and was allowed by the Finance Ministry to cut dividends on last year's profits so it could afford to comply with the central bank's switch."

YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) warned on Wednesday that first-quarter profit tumbled around 90% percent, a day before it is expected to announce more than 10,000 job cuts as the crisis deepens at Japan's second-largest automaker.
The dismal earnings, due to be formally announced on Thursday, mark one of Nissan's worst quarterly performances in around a decade. The automaker is fighting to rein in its operations after years of aggressive expansion under former chairman Carlos Ghosn, ousted last year in a dramatic scandal that shook the industry.
The planned job cuts over the next few years include the 4,800 detailed in May and will mostly be at factories overseas with low utilization rates, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. 
Nissan declined to comment on the job cuts. It said a Nikkei business daily report that it suffered roughly a 90% year-on-year drop in first-quarter operating profit was ""broadly accurate"". Its shares ended the day up nearly 1.0% earlier. 
Nissan is struggling to improve weak profit margins in the United States, a key market where Ghosn for years pushed to aggressively grow market share during his time as chief executive.
Years of heavy discounting to grow sales in the world's second-biggest auto market have left Nissan with falling demand for the Altima sedan and other models, a cheapened brand image, low resale values, and a nearly battered bottom line.
""Deteriorating performance in the United States is a big issue that we're facing,"" Motoo Nagai, chairman of the automaker's newly formed audit committee, said on Wednesday. 
""For a long time we were concerned with increasing volume (sold in the market). We were chasing numbers. Now it's time to enhance the brand,"" he said.
The job cuts to be disclosed this week would exceed 7% of Nissan's 138,000-strong workforce and are part of a broad ""turnaround"" strategy to be rolled out later this year, said another source, a top executive who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak with the media. 
The plan would be ""aimed at unwinding Ghosn’s negative legacies"", which has led to excess, he added. 
Regions with significantly under-utilised manufacturing capacity which could be affected by job cuts included India and Brazil, another source said. 
The latest job cuts highlight the extent of problems facing Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, who is also grappling with fractured relations with French alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) following the arrest of Ghosn, their shared former chairman.
Ghosn has been charged with financial misconduct in Japan and denies wrongdoing.
Saikawa kept his job in a vote at an annual shareholders meeting last month, fighting off a rare rebuke by top proxy advisory firms who urged shareholders not to reappoint him considering he was groomed for leadership by Ghosn.
But an extended tenure for Saikawa at Nissan may be unlikely, as the automaker has tasked a newly formed nominations committee with finding his successor. 

""We want to start the process to find a successor to the CEO as soon as possible,"" said Masakazu Toyoda, the automaker's lead external director who also chairs the new committee which will meet for the first time later on Wednesday.

Shemesh said Wix generated cash of $30 million in the quarter, pushing its cash reserves to $850 million. He said the company was not looking for acquisitions for now, preferring to focus on organic growth.

Wix's shares have jumped 62% this year after a 57% rise in 2018.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 06:33AM ET</span>",Hilton quarterly profit rises 20%,"(Reuters) - U.S. hotel operator  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT) topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by a steady demand for its rooms in the United States. 
However, the owner of Waldorf Astoria and Conrad hotel chains lowered the high end of its 2019 outlook for RevPAR - a key performance metric for the hotel industry - amid slowing global economies. 
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday lowered its estimate for global growth in 2019, as the U.S.-China trade spat and Brexit uncertainties are seen eroding business confidence and weakening investment spending.
The slowing growth directly affects travel budgets of corporates. 
Hilton said it now expects full-year RevPAR to increase between 1% and 2%, down from an earlier range of 1.0% to 3.0% rise.
The company now expects adjusted earnings for 2019 between $3.78 and $3.85 per share, compared to their previous forecast of $3.74 to $3.84 per share.
Hilton's net income attributable to stockholders rose to $260 million, or 89 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $217 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, Hilton earned $1.06 per share in the quarter beating analysts' average estimate of $1.02 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue rose 8.4% to $2.48 billion.

1627,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 06:23AM ET</span>",A $1.6 Trillion Fund Warns of a Ticking Liquidity Bomb,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Bank of England Governor Mark Carney says investment funds that promise to allow customers to withdraw their money on a daily basis are “built on a lie.” The chief investment officer of Europe’s biggest independent asset manager agrees with him.
“There is no point denying we are faced with a looming liquidity mismatch problem,” says Pascal Blanque, who oversees more than 1.4 trillion euros ($1.6 trillion) as the CIO of Amundi SA.
As I wrote earlier this month, market liquidity can melt away faster than a dropped ice-cream in a heatwave. That prospect is one of “various things keeping me awake at night,” Blanque told me earlier this week.
In the wake of the global financial crisis, regulators have obliged investment banks to bolster their balance sheets. That has reduced the amount of capital those institutions are willing to commit to the securities markets. So in many areas, liquidity is already drying up. For example, daily turnover in U.S. high-yield debt is at its lowest since 2014, as noted by my Bloomberg Television colleague Lisa Abramowicz:
Market making, where firms generate prices at which they are willing to either buy or sell financial products, is effectively “a public good,” Blanque says. As that activity declines, the drop in turnover reduces the banking industry’s exposure to a collapse in prices or a surge in volatility. But the dangers are simply transferred, rather than diminished.
“Market making is falling off a cliff at the level of individual banks, but creating a systemic problem,” Blanque says. “The banks are less risky – but the risks have been shifted to the buy side.”
That poses a problem for regulators, something the Bank of England acknowledged in a working paper published earlier this month. As the funds industry has supplanted banks as a source of credit in the past decade, households and companies have benefited from a useful alternative source of financing. But, the report warned, we don’t know how this market-based system will respond under stress.
Modelling such a scenario “can generate an adverse feedback loop in which lower asset prices cause solvency/liquidity constraints to bind, pushing asset prices lower still,” the BOE found. In other words, the new market structure may be worse than the old.
The difficulty for asset managers in such an eventuality is finding sufficient cash to repay exiting investors while preserving the structure of the portfolio without distorting market prices, according to Blanque. “We don’t know the channels of transmission, we don’t know how the actors will act,” he says. “It is uncharted territory.”
Part of Amundi’s response to the issue is to include liquidity buffers in its portfolios, which may mean holding securities such as German bunds and U.S. Treasuries, which should always trade freely. But the industry needs to come up with a common definition so that liquidity is included along with risk and return when assessing a portfolio’s robustness, Blanque says.
For now, asset managers have to cope with what Blanque called “the sacred cow” of allowing clients to withdraw funds on a daily basis. “It is a bomb, given the risks of liquidity mismatch,” he warns. “We don't know if what is sellable today will be sellable in six months’ time.”
Regulators are slowly coming to realize that the fund management industry has increased exponentially in both size and systemic importance in the past decade. I’ve argued before that asset managers should be stress tested in the same way as banks are forced to assess their ability to withstand market shocks. The recent distress experienced by customers of Tim Haywood, Neil Woodford and Bruno Crastes suggests that need is becoming more urgent."

1630,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",Aston Martin Plunges After Cutting Vehicle Sales Forecast on Challenging Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Aston Martin Lagonda fell the most since listing after reducing its full-year sales forecast because of intensifying weakness in key markets. The shares dropped as much as 24%.
The luxury sports-car manufacturer now expects wholesale deliveries to decline as much as 14% to as low as 6,300, the Gaydon, England-based company said Wednesday. That compares with a plan for 7,100 to 7,300 vehicle sales the carmaker anticipated in May.
The reduction is another blow in Aston Martin’s struggle to convince that it can make the transformation from niche player to successful listed company after an initial public offering last year. Since listing in October, the shares have more than halved compared to its IPO price of 19 pounds.
The carmaker joins a range of manufacturers dialing back expectations due to worsening demand. Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) most recently warned this month of lower-than-expected profits, followed this week by parts supplier  Continental AG  (DE:CONG).
Aston Martin was down 20% at 823.20 pence in early trading in London.
“We are today taking decisive action to manage inventory and the Aston Martin Lagonda brands for the long-term,” Chief Executive Officer Andy Palmer said in a statement.
Aston Martin also made a provision of 19 million pounds ($24 million) that’ll be accounted for during the second quarter. Taken together with the reduced sales outlook, that will result in an expected operating return on sales of about 8% for this year. The company said it’s taking actions to boost efficiency and reduce costs."
1631,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 05:49AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank posts 3.15 billion euro second-quarter loss on restructuring costs,"By Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) reported a bigger than forecast quarterly loss of 3.15 billion euros ($3.5 billion), underlining the challenges it faces as it attempts to turn around its struggling business.
Deutsche Bank had this month flagged it would lose around 2.8 billion euros in the quarter when it announced a restructuring plan that will see 18,000 jobs go and cost 7.4 billion euros overall.
The scale of the loss, compared with a profit of 401 million euros a year ago, prompted the bank's shares to slide as much as 5.8% in Frankfurt. The bigger loss stemmed from higher goodwill impairment charges than foreseen when the bank announced its restructuring on July 7, it said.
The bank, Germany's largest, is considered one of the most important banks for the global financial system, along with U.S. heavyweights JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
But Deutsche has been plagued by losses and scandal, prompting it to embark on one of the biggest overhauls to an investment bank since the aftermath of the financial crisis.
Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said on Wednesday that the bank had already taken significant steps in implementing the strategy. More than 900 employees had given notice or been told they would be made redundant. 
In a note to employees, Sewing said that the lender's underperforming investment bank faced ""strong headwinds"" in the quarter, including questions about the bank's future that spooked clients.
""Now we can look ahead with more optimism,"" he wrote.
TALE OF WOE
Deutsche's troubles peaked with a $7.2 billion U.S. fine in 2017 for its role in the mortgage market crisis, in a major blow that caused clients to flee.
A new leadership, with Sewing at the helm since last year, has tried to revive Deutsche's fortunes, but problems have persisted.
In April, the bank called off nearly six weeks of talks to merge with cross-town rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
It then embarked on a plan for ""tough cutbacks"" to its investment bank, representing a major retreat from investment banking for Deutsche Bank, which for years had tried to compete as a major force on Wall Street.
As it reshapes, the bank now expects 2019 revenue to be lower than in 2018. The forecast marks a further scaling down in expectations from previous quarters. 
Net revenue in the quarter fell 6% to 6.2 billion euros. Analysts on average had expected 6.3 billion euros in revenue, according to a consensus forecast posted on the bank's website. 
Revenue at Deutsche's cash-cow bond-trading division dropped 4% in the quarter, while equities sales and trading revenue dived 32%.
The declines underscore the continued weakness at the lender's investment bank, which saw an 18% drop in net revenues during the period.
RBC Capital Markets wrote that Deutsche's earnings illustrated the ""long road until we have visibility on the many stepping stones"" to a turnaround.
Among details of the overhaul announced earlier this month, Deutsche said it planned to scrap its global equities business and scale back its investment bank. It also reshuffled management. 
The bank will set up a new so-called ""bad bank"" to wind down unwanted assets, with a value of 74 billion euros of risk-weighted assets.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that it will take years to shed those unwanted assets, tying up capital that could have generated income of 500 million euros a year.
Some investors have told Reuters they doubted these moves would be enough to turn around its flagging fortunes in the face of intense competition and low interest rates.
Others investors have said they were worried Deutsche Bank would backtrack on a pledge not to tap shareholders for additional cash, particularly in view of its capital constraints.
""I really can't say that I see the positives in this plan. I remain a bitter curmudgeon,"" said Barrington Pitt-Miller, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.

The shares dropped as much as 24%.
The luxury sports-car manufacturer now expects wholesale deliveries to decline as much as 14% to as low as 6,300, the Gaydon, England-based company said Wednesday. That compares with a plan for 7,100 to 7,300 vehicle sales the carmaker anticipated in May.
The reduction is another blow in Aston Martin’s struggle to convince that it can make the transformation from niche player to successful listed company after an initial public offering last year. Since listing in October, the shares have more than halved compared to its IPO price of 19 pounds.
The carmaker joins a range of manufacturers dialing back expectations due to worsening demand. Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) most recently warned this month of lower-than-expected profits, followed this week by parts supplier  Continental AG  (DE:CONG).
Aston Martin was down 20% at 823.20 pence in early trading in London.
“We are today taking decisive action to manage inventory and the Aston Martin Lagonda brands for the long-term,” Chief Executive Officer Andy Palmer said in a statement.
Aston Martin also made a provision of 19 million pounds ($24 million) that’ll be accounted for during the second quarter. Taken together with the reduced sales outlook, that will result in an expected operating return on sales of about 8% for this year. The company said it’s taking actions to boost efficiency and reduce costs."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) reported a bigger than forecast quarterly loss of 3.15 billion euros ($3.5 billion), underlining the challenges it faces as it attempts to turn around its struggling business.
Deutsche Bank had this month flagged it would lose around 2.8 billion euros in the quarter when it announced a restructuring plan that will see 18,000 jobs go and cost 7.4 billion euros overall.
The scale of the loss, compared with a profit of 401 million euros a year ago, prompted the bank's shares to slide as much as 5.8% in Frankfurt. The bigger loss stemmed from higher goodwill impairment charges than foreseen when the bank announced its restructuring on July 7, it said.
The bank, Germany's largest, is considered one of the most important banks for the global financial system, along with U.S. heavyweights JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
But Deutsche has been plagued by losses and scandal, prompting it to embark on one of the biggest overhauls to an investment bank since the aftermath of the financial crisis.
Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said on Wednesday that the bank had already taken significant steps in implementing the strategy. More than 900 employees had given notice or been told they would be made redundant. 
In a note to employees, Sewing said that the lender's underperforming investment bank faced ""strong headwinds"" in the quarter, including questions about the bank's future that spooked clients.
""Now we can look ahead with more optimism,"" he wrote.
TALE OF WOE
Deutsche's troubles peaked with a $7.2 billion U.S. fine in 2017 for its role in the mortgage market crisis, in a major blow that caused clients to flee.
A new leadership, with Sewing at the helm since last year, has tried to revive Deutsche's fortunes, but problems have persisted.
In April, the bank called off nearly six weeks of talks to merge with cross-town rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
It then embarked on a plan for ""tough cutbacks"" to its investment bank, representing a major retreat from investment banking for Deutsche Bank, which for years had tried to compete as a major force on Wall Street.
As it reshapes, the bank now expects 2019 revenue to be lower than in 2018. The forecast marks a further scaling down in expectations from previous quarters. 
Net revenue in the quarter fell 6% to 6.2 billion euros. Analysts on average had expected 6.3 billion euros in revenue, according to a consensus forecast posted on the bank's website. 
Revenue at Deutsche's cash-cow bond-trading division dropped 4% in the quarter, while equities sales and trading revenue dived 32%.
The declines underscore the continued weakness at the lender's investment bank, which saw an 18% drop in net revenues during the period.
RBC Capital Markets wrote that Deutsche's earnings illustrated the ""long road until we have visibility on the many stepping stones"" to a turnaround.
Among details of the overhaul announced earlier this month, Deutsche said it planned to scrap its global equities business and scale back its investment bank. It also reshuffled management. 
The bank will set up a new so-called ""bad bank"" to wind down unwanted assets, with a value of 74 billion euros of risk-weighted assets.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that it will take years to shed those unwanted assets, tying up capital that could have generated income of 500 million euros a year.
Some investors have told Reuters they doubted these moves would be enough to turn around its flagging fortunes in the face of intense competition and low interest rates.
Others investors have said they were worried Deutsche Bank would backtrack on a pledge not to tap shareholders for additional cash, particularly in view of its capital constraints.
""I really can't say that I see the positives in this plan. I remain a bitter curmudgeon,"" said Barrington Pitt-Miller, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 05:45AM ET</span>",Philippines' Jollibee buying U.S. firm Coffee Bean for $100 million,"By Neil Jerome Morales
MANILA (Reuters) -  Jollibee Foods  Corp (PS:JFC), Philippines' largest food service network operator, is buying U.S. brand Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (CBTL) for $100 million as part of an expansion outside its home market.
Jollibee, which has a market value of nearly $5.5 billion, is buying loss-making CBTL from private equity firm Advent International and other investors including the Sassoon family, a large shareholder in CBTL.
Los Angeles-based CBTL has 1,189 outlets spread across the United States, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and is rapidly growing in Asia. Nearly three-fourths of its outlets are franchised.
Jollibee will invest $100 million for an 80% share in a Singapore holding company that will acquire CBTL. The remaining 20% stake will be owned by Jollibee's partner in its Vietnam coffee and restaurant business.
As part of the transaction, Jollibee will fork out another $250 million, a portion of which was allotted to pay CBTL's debt. The amount will be paid back by the holding company.
""The acquisition of Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf will be Jollibee's largest and most multinational so far with business presence in 27 countries,"" Jollibee Chairman Tony Tan Caktiong said in a statement on Wednesday.
The deal allows Jollibee to be a key player in the large, fast-growing and profitable coffee business, said Tan Caktiong, adding that the priority is to accelerate Coffee Bean's growth in Asia. The acquisition will add 14% to Jollibee's global system-wide sales and 26% to its total store network, he said.
""They really want to diversify their income stream. At the same time it is a business they know,"" said Robert Ramos, senior vice-president and trust officer of Eastwest Bank in Manila.
Jollibee believes higher income in the Philippines will support spending on higher-end products like specialty coffee, said Ramos, who helps manage 30 billion pesos ($585.94 million), including an index fund that holds Jollibee shares.
Shares in Jollibee fell 8% on Wednesday, their biggest daily drop in nearly three years, which Ramos attributed to the spending the company will be making. The broader Philippine index (PSI) closed 1.1 lower.
Known for its sweet-style spaghetti, burgers and fried chicken, Jollibee is dominant in the Philippines, outselling McDonald's and Yum Brands' KFC. It operates the largest fast-food chain in the Southeast Asian nation with 3,195 restaurants.
Jollibee also has 1,418 stores across various brands overseas. It is expanding overseas, including in China and the United States, by investing in restaurant chains catering to local tastes.
CBTL posted $312.95 million in revenues and $21 million in net losses last year. It had debt of $83.56 million as of end-2018.

(Reuters) - European stock markets were flat on Wednesday, subdued by dour signals from  Deutsche Bank  and  Aston Martin  as well as a slide in commodity-linked stocks, with weak euro zone manufacturing and services surveys adding to worries on the outlook for growth.
The purchasing manager (PMI) surveys showed euro zone business growth was weaker than expected in July, hampered by a deepening contraction in manufacturing, and some indicators suggested conditions will get worse next month.
France's CAC 40 (FCHI) erased early gains to fall 0.2% after the data, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) pared gains.
""German manufacturers especially in the car industry are pretty anxious about looming tariffs which seems to be suppressing the sentiment within the sector,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank.
""It all depends on how things will go between U.S. and China and the U.S. and European Union because the manufacturing industry is very export oriented.""
On the earnings front, shares in Germany's biggest bank (DE:DBKGn), in the midst of sweeping changes to reboot its business, fell 3.7% after it reported a bigger than expected loss, while those in luxury car maker Aston (L:AML) sank 23.2% after it cut its annual forecast for wholesale sales.
Positive signs on U.S.-China trade talks and the prospect of a supportive message from the European Central Bank on Thursday offset those blows, along with some positive earnings from French carmaker  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and German chemicals maker  Covestro AG  (DE:1COV).
By 0808 GMT, the pan-European stocks benchmark STOXX 600 (STOXX) was trading flat, hovering around two-week highs hit a day earlier.
Stocks have been shakier in the past fortnight after recovering strongly from falls in May that were the worst in more than two years.
While investors have dialed down forecasts for corporate earnings in the near-term, expectations that major central banks will loosen monetary policy continue to prop up sentiment.
""We view the behavior of the equity market as driven by expectations of Fed easing and a consequent recovery in the economy,"" Nordea strategist Sebastian Galy said in a morning note.
""We also view earnings as in a slight recession for the next two quarters, (which) the market is looking beyond ... looking at longer-term growth and whether current policies will achieve them.
Basic materials (SXPP) slid 1.5%, with a fall in iron ore prices and a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) downgrade to 'underperform' taking shares of  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO) down 4%.
That pushed London's commodity-heavy FTSE 100 (FTSE) 0.5% lower.
Shares of Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), and Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) rose between 1.1% and 2.4% after results from Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN) hinted that a global slowdown in microchip demand would not be as long as feared.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were mostly lower by mid-morning on Wednesday as fresh business surveys suggested the contraction in manufacturing deepened in July, a trend also borne out by more gloomy outlooks and disappointing earnings figures.
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.3% at 390.52 by 4:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), while the U.K. FTSE was down 0.9% and the German DAX was up 0.1%. 
The “flash” reading for IHS Markit’s purchasing manager index for the Eurozone manufacturing sector fell to its lowest in six years, with the German index dropping to its lowest since 2009, dashing hopes for some stabilization. Evidence that the problem is a global one had come earlier, with declines in the comparable indexes for both Australia and Japan. The Richmond Federal Reserve’s manufacturing survey on Tuesday, meanwhile, had also shown business conditions at their weakest in six years.
Against that backdrop, Peugeot's (PA:PEUP) report of an 11% rise in operating income for the first half stood out, driving the stock 2.1% higher, even though the company revised down its expectations for the global auto market this year at the same time.
At the other end of the scale,   Aston Martin   Lagonda (LON:AML) fell over 20% after slashing its sales and margin guidance for the year, citing “macro-economic uncertainty and enduring weakness in UK and European markets.”
Somewhere in between was   Daimler   (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz, which rebounded from early losses after saying it would step up its cost-cutting plans in the face of weak demand.
Stocks had started the morning with a tailwind out of Asia on the news that the U.S. and China would resume high-level talks on trade for the first time in weeks. That follows a meeting between President Donald Trump and U.S. tech companies to thrash out issues relating to the conditions under which they can sell to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.
Elsewhere in Europe,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares fell below 7 euros again after it announced a bigger second-quarter restructuring charge than expected in the wake of its slash-and-burn exercise a couple of weeks ago.  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE), one of the world’s biggest renewable power companies, rose 1.1% after it reported profit above expectations and said it now expects full-year profit to rise more than 10%.
In the U.K., broadcaster   ITV   (LON:ITV) rose 5.5% after reporting a smaller drop in revenue than feared, and announcing two new series of its “Love Island” moneyspinner. Shares in iron ore miners fell though after Brazil’s Vale (NYSE:VALE) announced the restart of production at one of its largest mines."

1646,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 04:22AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank’s Long Trading Slump Deepened in Run-Up to Revamp,"(Bloomberg) --  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) said lower interest rates will increase pressure on revenue after its trading slump deepened in the second quarter, adding urgency to Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing’s overhaul plans.
The bank again underperformed Wall Street peers in trading, with income from buying and selling securities slumping 12%, led by a decline of about a third in the equities business. The bottom line result was also worse than expected after the bank booked a 3.4 billion euro restructuring charge.
Shares of the lender slumped in early trading as Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke suggested the outlook for lower rates could complicate the turnaround. Sewing this month unveiled the biggest cutbacks yet to the investment bank, including the wholesale exit from equities trading. Speculation about the future of the unit compounded the impact of Wall Street’s worst first half for securities trading in a decade.
“Frankly it does represent a revenue pressure for us and all of the banks if rates from here go down further,” von Moltke said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “It’s something that, as you say, is a significant risk to us.”
Deutsche Bank fell 5.2% at 9:22 a.m. in Frankfurt trading, the worst performer among the large European lenders.
‘Very Aware’
Von Moltke said earlier this month that the goal of lifting return on tangible equity to 8% in 2022 “is realistic given the interest rate environment we’re facing.” The bank wants to boost its annual revenue by 2 billion euros through 2022, helped by a “modest improvement” in rates.
“We provided a set of numbers,” von Moltke said on Wednesday. “As one always does, one has to make some planning assumptions, those happened to be at the end of May and we are very aware that the outlook deteriorated during June.”
He said that if the European Central Bank does lower rates, he expects it to shield commercial banks from further harm through deposit tiering, in which some overnight deposits that banks park at the ECB are excluded or charged a less punitive rate.
“Client retention risks, an unfavorable interest rate environment and negative secular trends across divisions present material headwinds to management plans,” Thomas Hallett, bank analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London, wrote in a note. “These results do little to allay market concerns on the ability to deliver on those targets.”
Deutsche Bank bank booked 3.4 billion euros ($3.8 billion) of restructuring charges in the second quarter, more than it had guided, resulting in a 3.2 billion-euro net loss for the second quarter. It previously said it expected a net loss of around 2.8 billion euros. Adjusting for the charges, net income would have been 231 million euros, higher than the bank had indicated when it announced the restructuring.
Deutsche Bank’s trading result in the second quarter compares with a decline of around 8% at the five biggest Wall Street banks. UBS Group AG on Tuesday reported a 9% slump in equities trading and 7% lower revenue from fixed income.
Deutsche Bank said it started losing business during the quarter as it became clear it would exit equities trading. Sergio Ermotti, the UBS CEO, said Tuesday that some of the balances from the German lender’s business are coming to his bank’s prime brokerage unit.
Fixed income trading, a traditional strength of Deutsche Bank, declined 11% when adjusting for a one-time item, the bank said. Sewing is keeping that business, while reducing the amount of capital it uses.
As part of its exit from equities, the German lender had agreed to transfer some 150 billion euros of balances linked to hedge funds to French rival  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA, but clients have been pulling about $1 billion of funds per day and going elsewhere as the firms iron out the details, people familiar with the matter have said. Deutsche Bank is planning to auction its equity derivatives portfolio and kick off the process in the coming weeks, a person familiar with the matter said.
At the global transaction bank, which Sewing is separating from the investment bank to make it the centerpiece of a new corporate bank division headed by Stefan Hoops, revenue was essentially flat when adjusting for a one-time gain a year earlier.
The German lender’s overhaul resulted in the departure of investment banking head Garth Ritchie. Sewing has taken over oversight over the division at the management board level while operational oversight has been split between Hoops; Mark Fedorcik, head of the investment bank; and Ram Nayak, in charge of fixed-income trading. Christiana Riley, who’s running the bank’s U.S. operations, will join the management board pending regulatory approval.

1647,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 03:41AM ET</span>","PSA Group profit jumps on pricing, Opel synergies","By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) delivered a sharp increase in first-half profit, defying a global industry downturn as new models and cost savings from the integration of Opel-Vauxhall more than made up for weaker emerging market sales.
Standing out against profit warnings from peers such as  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), PSA said on Wednesday its efficiency drive produced a 10.6% operating income gain even as deliveries went the other way - with a 12.8% decline posted earlier this month.
That lifted the  Peugeot  maker's operating margin to a new 8.7% record from 7.8% a year earlier, boosted by a 270 million euro ($301 million) increase in cost savings on purchasing, research and development and overheads.
""Our results are proving the sustainability of our performance despite the weakness of global markets,"" Chief Financial Officer Philippe de Rovira told reporters on a call.
The recurring operating income came in at 3.34 billion euros, with net income up by almost a quarter to 1.832 billion as revenue slid 0.7% to 38.3 billion.
""PSA continues to buck the trend being seen among most carmakers,"" Citi analyst Raghav Gupta-Chaudhary said. Barring any new merger opportunities, PSA could have about 3 billion euros in excess cash to return to shareholders, he added.
PSA's pricing and profitability also benefited from new models such as the Citroen C5 Aircross SUV and a trio of commercial van launches - with strong gains in evidence at Opel-Vauxhall, acquired from General Motors (N:GM) in 2017.
PSA shares were up 0.8% as of 0713 GMT in Paris, set against a smaller decline for European automotive stocks (SXAP). Much of the operating-cost improvement stemmed from steady integration of the vehicle technologies and architectures underpinning new models across the Peugeot, Citroen, DS, Opel and Vauxhall brands.
PSA's bottom-line improvement came despite a 302 million-euro hit from China that included a 139 million asset writedown reflecting a steady plunge in the group's sales - down another 61% in the first half.
The French carmaker is seeking to cut capacity at its manufacturing venture with its 12.2% shareholder Dongfeng, De Rovira said on Wednesday.
For the full year, PSA predicted further auto-market contractions of 1% in Europe, 4% in Latin America and 7% in China, with Russia growing 3%.
But European sales disruption in late 2018 - when tougher emissions rules forced competitors to suspend key models including the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Golf - means the market is likely to grow in the latter half of 2019, the CFO said.
The risk of a hard Brexit, however, make it ""difficult to predict what the operating environment will be"", he added.

PSA said its positive free cash flow came to almost 1.6 billion euros at group level in the first half, with 2.29 billion euros at the core car-manufacturing business.

1650,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 01:36AM ET</span>","Citi Private Favors Corporate, EM Bonds, Underweight Stocks","(Bloomberg) -- Citi Private Bank is advising its wealthiest customers to put more money into U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds and bank loans, while staying underweight government debt and equities.
The  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) unit that caters for clients with a minimum $10 million also favors emerging-market bonds, which are likely to benefit as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, said Roger Bacon, head of investments Asia Pacific based in Hong Kong.
“Extending duration is something the clients are very focused on,” Bacon said in an interview in Singapore. “We are increasing allocation to U.S. investment-grade corporate debt. We are increasing client allocations to certain parts of emerging-market debt.”
The average Citi private client’s balanced portfolio now has a 1.5% overweight in income-producing securities, and an average underweight of 2% for stocks, Bacon said, citing data as of June.
Bonds have rallied around the world this year as the Fed has signaled a willingness to ease policy amid signs global growth is faltering. A Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index of U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds has returned 10% over the past 12 months, while the MSCI World Index of stocks has gained just 3%.
Bacon says the Fed will probably cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points in July and by the same amount in September, which matches the pricing given by fed fund futures. “We are now in the cutting part of the cycle, which we wouldn’t have said 12 months ago,” he said.
Citi Private Bank also favors the debt of companies that are domestically focused, such as those in the food and beverage industry, which are likely to outperform amid the U.S.-China trade war.
“We’ve been taking the opportunity to raise quality within clients’ fixed-income portfolios,” Bacon said.

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2019 01:31AM ET</span>",KKR buying Australian Tim Tam cookie maker from Campbell for $2.2 billion,"By Paulina Duran and Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - KKR & Co (N:KKR) said it is buying  Campbell Soup  Co's (N:CPB) Australian snacks unit Arnott's that will give it ownership of top-selling biscuit brands such as Tim Tam, in a deal local media reported was worth $2.2 billion.
""I can confirm that KKR's offer for Arnott's was accepted by Campbell's late last night,"" an Australia-based spokeswoman for the New York-headquartered buyout firm said in an email, without specifying the price or commenting further.
The Australian Financial Review reported earlier without citing sources that the agreed sale price was $2.2 billion, less than the over $3 billion the seller reportedly wanted for the asset.
A Campbell Soup spokeswoman declined to comment on the report and said the unit had not yet been sold.
""The process to divest Arnott's and the rest of our international operations is ongoing,"" the spokeswoman for the U.S. food company said in a statement.
The sale marks the second change of offshore ownership of a large Australian food and drink brand in a week, after Belgian beer maker  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) agreed to offload its Australian operations - with best-selling labels like VB and Carlton Draught - to Japan's Asahi (T:2502) for $11 billion.
In 2016, Philippines-based Universal Robina Corp (PS:URC) paid $460 million for the maker of some of Australia's best-known salty snacks, including CC's, Kettle chips and Thins, from local interests.
Two years before that, Universal Robina paid $470 million for New Zealand's top snack maker Griffin's Foods Ltd from Australian private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners (PEP). 
Companies like Arnott's and the AB InBev unit ""have a long history in Australia, and therefore have a degree of customer loyalty that can be harnessed to create value for these companies and expand their market share,"" said Matthew Reeves, an analyst at IBISWorld.
""Being located in the Asia-Pacific, close to many developing economies, Australia is a springboard to expand into these countries,"" he added.
Though Australians are used to Arnott's being owned by foreign interests - Campbell bought it in 1997 - the sale gives KKR control of assets that have been synonymous with snacking in the 12th-largest economy for a century and a half. Arnott's also makes Iced Vovos, SAO, Wagon Wheel, Monte Carlo and Mint Slice biscuits.
Australian media had reported PEP bid for Arnott's. Mondelez (O:MDLZ) was also cited by Australian and other media as interested in the business, which the U.S. company has declined to comment on. Representatives for PEP declined to comment. 
Campbell put its international unit and ""fresh"" units up for sale last August under pressure from investors to improve profitability and stock performance.

This month, it sold its Danish unit Kelsen Group to an affiliate of Nutella maker Ferrero SpA for $300 million.

The dismissals come on top of the plan unveiled in May to shed 4,800 jobs, revamp car models and boost poor sales in the U.S. The further cuts would take the total number of reductions to 10,000, or more than 7% of Nissan’s workforce. Nissan shares rose 1.1% in early trading on Wednesday in Tokyo.
A representative for Nissan in Japan declined to comment. Kyodo said Nissan is expected to reveal the plan when it reports quarterly results on Thursday.
Nissan is under pressure to revive its business following car-inspection scandals as well as last year’s arrest and ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, bringing deep tensions with alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) to the surface. The carmaker’s operating profit fell to the lowest in a decade in 2018.
Nissan’s operating profit will decline 66% to 37.2 billion yen ($344 million) in the first fiscal quarter through June, according to the average of analysts’ projections compiled by Bloomberg. Sales will decline 3% to 2.63 trillion yen, analysts predict.
Ghosn, arrested in November in Tokyo on allegations of financial misconduct, is free on bail as he prepares for a trial that will probably start next year. The former chairman of the alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., has denied all charges against him.

1655,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 09:51PM ET</span>",Bank drops objection to financing request by bankrupt Philadelphia Energy Solutions,"By Laila Kearney
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A bank dropped its objection on Tuesday to Philadelphia Energy Solutions Inc's initial bankruptcy requests after the two sides struck an agreement over the terms of new financing.
PES filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday after a fire last month prompted it to close the largest refinery on the U.S. East Coast.
ICBC Standard Bank Plc [SBKJLS.UL], which finalized an intermediation agreement to buy PES's crude and refined products last month, initially objected to the terms of the debtor-in-possession financing sought by PES because it did not give the bank priority over any insurance payouts stemming from the June fire that destroyed a section of the refinery.
ICBC Standard, a joint venture between a South African bank and Chinese bank, said PES owes it more than $300 million in early termination fees and other costs, according to filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. But the two sides struck a deal on the terms of the financing during a hearing on Tuesday in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware, according to a spokesman for the bank.
The hearing, which largely dealt with less complicated requests, was the first since the refiner filed for bankruptcy protection.
The fire tore through an alkylation unit at the Girard Point section of the refinery, scattering debris across nearby highways. PES said days later that it would have to shut the complex and lay off about 1,000 workers.
Nobody died in the blaze, which is currently under investigation by at least three federal agencies.
At the time of the fire, ICBC Standard said it had $1.6 billion worth of crude and products stored at the 335,000 barrel-per-day Philadelphia plant, and the bank has not been able to gain access to all of it.
PES in recent weeks attempted to tap in to $1.25 billion in property damage and loss of business insurance coverage, but its request was denied, the company said in court filings.
The refinery said that refusal forced it to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy over the weekend. With the infusion of funds, PES said it could have kept the facility open, but instead it is in the process of draining the 1,300-acre site of its inventory and idling the facility.
""These insurance proceeds are the very heart of these Chapter 11 cases: the sooner the debtors (PES) can recover, the sooner the business can complete its recovery,"" PES said in a filing, signed by its chief restructuring officer, Jeffrey Stein.
By the time PES filed for bankruptcy, the company had only $45 million of cash in deposit accounts, which was ICBC collateral. The funds were not enough to pay for the extraction of inventory or wind down the facility, PES said.
Instead of receiving an advance on its insurance payout, PES is seeking $100 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its current lenders to pay for the shutdown process, bankruptcy and other obligations."
1656,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 09:26PM ET</span>","Australia's Westpac brings forward RBA rate cut forecast, A$ slips","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp has brought forward the timing of its forecast for the next rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to October, from November previously, chief economist Bill Evans said on Wednesday.
The Australian dollar slipped to a 1-1/2-week trough of $0.6984 after Evans' note, extending losses for a fourth straight day and further drifting away from a recent three-month top of $0.7082.
The RBA has chopped the cash rate twice to 1% since June as it awaits a revival in inflation, which has undershot its 2-3% medium-term target for more than three years now.
The unemployment rate has also risen in recent months to 5.2% from 4.9% in February. The RBA estimates full employment at 4.5% - the level at which wage pressures could emerge.
Evans said the unemployment forecast is going to challenge the RBA.
""By October, we expect that the path of the unemployment rate will be sufficiently contrary to the RBA's plans that they will have appropriate justification to ease policy a little earlier than we had previously expected,"" Evans wrote to clients in a note.
Westpac's own forecast for the jobless rate by end-2019 is 5.4% with a range of leading indicators signaling a slowdown in employment growth over the remainder of 2019 and into 2020.
Evans said there is a chance the RBA could cut the cash rate to 0.75% in September but the Board will likely wait for more data before moving again. He expects another cut in February 2020 to 0.50%.
""Our forecasts of inflation and unemployment emphasize the extent of the challenge faced by the RBA in boosting demand and wages and reaching their own targets. We expect that the RBA will eventually see only one more rate cut, in October, as being an insufficient response."""

(Reuters) - Shared office space manager WeWork is looking to go public as soon as September, earlier than previously expected, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
The company is expected to make its initial public offering paperwork public in August, the person said.
The developments were first reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.
WeWork declined to comment.
WeWork will host an analyst day for Wall Street banks on July 31 as part of preparations for its IPO, Reuters reported last week.
WeWork is also looking to raise $5 billion to $6 billion through a bond offering before the IPO, the source added, requesting anonymity because the matter is private. This is more than it had previously been looking to raise.
The debt offering could provide comfort to those investing in the IPO who might be concerned that the cash burn at WeWork is so great it will need to raise more money after the initial offering, which would dilute their shareholdings.
""That's a very known psychology by underwriters and IPO investors, and (that fear), that’s something people try to guard against,"" said Adam Troso, head of real estate corporate advisory at Greenhill & Co in New York.
WeWork was recently valued at $47 billion in a private fundraising round, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world.
However, the money-losing company has faced questions about the sustainability of its business model, which is based on short-term revenue agreements and long-term loan liabilities.
The losses at WeWork's parent company narrowed slightly in the first quarter of 2019 to $264 million as revenue continues to double annually."

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and aides were expected to leave for Shanghai on Monday, Bloomberg reported, with two days of talks scheduled. But the report suggested a deal wasn't near.
Nonetheless, the first face-to-face talks since May were good news for investors, already disposed to buying thanks to strong quarterly results from soft-drink giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), toymaker Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) and paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) and buying in Hershey (NYSE:HSY) ahead of its second-quarter earnings report due Thursday.
The S&P 500 jumped over 3,000 again and added 0.68%. The Dow Jones industrials also jumped 0.65%. And the Nasdaq Composite added 0.58%.
Wednesday could well be a drama-queen kind of day. Aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) reports second-quarter results before the open, and the earnings call will probably focus on issues besetting the grounded 737 Max jetliner. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reports second-quarter earnings after the close.
Lastly, traders will have a chance to react to a Wall Street Journal report that the Justice Department is opening a broad inquiry into whether dominant technology firms are unlawfully stifling competition. That could threaten Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google business, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the Journal said.
The probe will look at the practices of online platforms that dominate internet search, social media and retail services, the story said.
Shares of all four were higher (barely, in Facebook's case) in regular trading but were down about 1% each in after-hours trading.
Coca-Cola was the big Dow winner, hitting a 52-week high after handily beating Street estimates for the quarter. The company cited success with new and reformulated beverages.
Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) was the leader among S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 stocks, jumping nearly 10% and hitting a 52-week high as it said its tie-ins on products with Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) blockbuster films this summer have been highly successful and should continue for some time.
Twenty-two Nasdaq 100 stocks were lower on the day. Some, like Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), were modestly lower as some investors were ready to cash in profits. Both stocks have jumped more than 37% this year.
After the close, social-media company Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) shares were up more than 11% after losses narrowed and its user base grew in the latest quarter. Shares of chipmaker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) were up 5.6% after hours after it beat estimates, even if lower than a year ago.
The one downside to Tuesday's bullishness was a disappointing existing-home-sales report from the National Association of Realtors. The seasonally adjusted sales rate in June of 4.69 million units was off 1.5% from May and 1.7% from a year ago. Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said sales were back to 2015 levels.
Homebuilder shares were pummeled. PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) fell 8.3%. DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) dropped 2.6%. Hovnanian (NYSE:HOV) slumped 10.5%. 
The bullishness about the U.S.-China news pushed oil prices higher because a deal theoretically could boost global oil demand.West Texas Intermediate crude rose 49 cents to $56.77 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, added 57 cents to $63.83.

(Reuters) - Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc provided some relief that a global slowdown in microchip demand would not be as long as feared, posting quarterly profit and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates on Tuesday.
Shares of the company rose 6.4% to $127.70 in extended trading and were on track to open at a record high on Wednesday.
The company had previously warned that the slowdown may last a few more quarters, as China's economy cools and manufacturers face the fallout of a prolonged U.S.-China trade dispute.
When asked whether the trade dispute was impacting the company's ability to conduct business in China, Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said, ""No, not at all"".
The market was also encouraged by the numbers from one of the first chipmakers to report earnings for the quarter, as there were uncertainties around demand due to higher tariffs and the fallout from China's Huawei Technologies.
Texas, whose broad lineup of products makes it a proxy for the chip industry, said it expected third-quarter revenue to be between $3.65 billion and $3.95 billion. The company also estimated a profit of between $1.31 and $1.53 per share.
Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $3.83 billion and profit of $1.38 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""Guidance reflects the improved sequential demand due to seasonality in all of its end-markets, offset by the on-going macro uncertainty,"" Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said.
Chan, however, expressed concerns about the continued choppy demand in industrial and automotive markets due to slowing growth in China.
Sales from industrial and automotive units, its fastest growing areas, together accounted for more than half of the company's revenue in 2018.
Net income fell to $1.31 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from $1.41 billion, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts had expected a profit of $1.22 per share.

(Reuters) - Snap Inc's Snapchat on Tuesday beat analysts' estimates for user growth and revenue, getting a boost from a better version of its Android app and the launch of new augmented reality photo lenses.
The company said the number of daily active users rose to 203 million in the second quarter ended June 30 from 190 million in the prior quarter. The user metric was also up from 188 million a year earlier.
Shares of Snap jumped 9% to $16.29 in after-hours trading.
The AR lenses, which are filters that can overlay everything from bunny ears to freckles onto a user's photo, went viral when it introduced a lens that let users switch their gender in photos.
The latest daily active user figure, widely watched by investors and advertisers, beat analysts' average estimate of 192.2 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
After struggling last year with declines in users and high executive turnover, Snap finally returned to growth in the first quarter.
In recent months, it scored wins with its augmented reality lenses, launched mobile games within Snapchat in partnership with game developers such as Zynga Inc and invested in more content on Discover, the part of the app that houses original shows and content from media partners.
""The popularity of these lenses drew millions of people into our rebuilt Android application, where they experienced the new and improved Snapchat that led to increased engagement,"" Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said on the earnings call with analysts.
Snap's revenue, which it earns from selling advertising on the app, jumped about 48% to $388 million and beat Wall Street's average estimate of $359.7 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Snapchat has been largely untouched by privacy issues plaguing  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google's YouTube, two of Snap's rivals for digital ad dollars, because of its disappearing messages that make it difficult to broadcast misinformation or unsavory content.
Snap expects daily active users to be between 205 million and 207 million in the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen said.
Of the 13 million daily active users Snap gained during the second quarter, 7 million to 9 million were from the new augmented reality lenses, Andersen said.
Analysts questioned whether Snap could retain the new users it gained from the lenses, during the earnings call.
Spiegel said the lenses not only attracted new users but re-engaged returning users.
It is unclear if Snap can continue having hits like viral lenses every quarter, ""but if you can keep engagement going, that's the key,"" said Ron Josey, an analyst with JMP Securities. Average revenue per user jumped more than 36% to $1.91 in the quarter.
Snap emphasized its investment in content on Discover, which increased the time spent on the app by 60% compared with last year, said Kamal Khan, an analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.
""That trend will continue in the near and medium term, but just like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), it’s betting a lot on content against rivals with much, much deeper pockets,"" he said.
Net loss narrowed to $255.2 million, or 19 cents per share, from $353.3 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company lost 6 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 10 cents per share.
Snap expects third quarter revenue in the range of $410 million to $435 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $402.1 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
1661,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 06:53PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Deutsche Bank's problem derivatives cloud recovery - sources,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  AG's (DE:DBKGn) turnaround strategy rests in large part on shedding 288 billion euros of unwanted assets. Three bank insiders said it will take years, tying up capital that could have generated income of 500 million euros ($557 million) a year.
The opportunity cost of unloading the assets, which has not been previously reported, underscores the challenges facing Chief Executive Christian Sewing as he attempts to turn around the bank and restore confidence among investors who have seen the value of their shares decline by 75% in the past four years.
Sewing said earlier this month that Deutsche, Germany's largest lender, would set up a bad bank to house the assets, which include equity, credit and interest-rate derivatives. The bank said it wants to offload most of its derivatives by 2020. Executives managing the book can either sell positions or allow them to gradually wind down over time, depending on which is more profitable. 
The bank is planning an auction of its short-dated equity derivatives book, having already received ""significant expressions of interest,"" the sources familiar with the matter said. However, its long-dated interest rate and credit derivatives are expected to be much harder to offload, the sources said. 
Deutsche Bank has held on-and-off talks with potential buyers of some of those assets over the past two years, three people said. The sales did not happen because the prices offered would have resulted in hundreds of millions of euros in losses for the bank, they said. 
The bank's decision to maintain the derivatives, rather than sell them at current market values, was strategic, Group Treasurer Dixit Joshi told Reuters Tuesday. He declined to comment on the 500 million euro figure.    
""The metric we look at is how much capital are we freeing up from the capital release unit, net of any costs attached to that,"" he said. ""At the end of the process, the CRU (capital release unit) will release substantial capital that allows us to undertake the restructuring."" 
The derivatives themselves are not creating losses, but global regulations introduced following the financial crisis have forced the bank to hold more capital against them, which means Deutsche Bank cannot use those dollars for more profitable investments, the people said. 
The 500 million euro figure is measured by how much the capital requirement is dragging on Deutsche Bank's return on tangible equity, the people said. It is a key measure of how much profit a bank generates from shareholder funds. 
Derivatives profits are often booked in their entirety when trades are made. But the assets sit on a bank's books for the duration, meaning the bank must hold capital against them and take gains or losses as markets affect values. 
""NO NEED FOR A FIRE SALE""
Deutsche Bank's derivatives plan is part of a broader restructuring, in which it will shed 18,000 jobs worldwide.
The full extent of the bank's derivatives exposure is still being assessed as the bank examines each position being placed in the bad bank, said the people, who include senior Deutsche Bank staff in New York and London.
It is doubtful that the bank would be able to sell the positions in their entirety without taking a large write-down requiring the bank to raise capital from shareholders, the three people said.
When it announced its restructuring plan, Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the likely cost of offloading problem assets. However, it categorically ruled out a capital raise.
""We're confident we will fund our transformation within our existing resources,"" Joshi told Reuters. 
Deutsche Bank has already done four capital raises totaling 29.3 billion euros since 2010. It is uncertain investors would be willing to pony up yet more cash.
Sewing hopes to free up capital that can be returned to shareholders while retaining profitable businesses such as transaction banking. The bank wants to begin returning 5 billion euros of capital to shareholders in 2022.
Deutsche Bank has said that its capital levels will fall while it winds down assets in its bad bank and has regulatory approval for its common equity to drop from its current level of just over 13.5% to 12.5%. It is unclear if its supervisors would tolerate a decline below that.
Deutsche Bank built up its derivatives book during a time of aggressive expansion when it wanted to compete with Wall Street giants such as Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). The size of the book peaked in 2011, and has fallen since. 
Joshi said the bank can avoid deep discounts in shedding the derivatives. ""We have no need for a fire sale given the quality of the assets and the run-down profile,"" he said. 
Many investors remain skeptical.    

""They are not in a position to mark these things down and sell them off because they don't have the capital to spare and it's not clear where the next capital injection will come from,"" said Ali Miremadi, portfolio manager at shareholder GAM. ""Really, they have no choice but to sit there and wait for them to unwind.""

The maker of Snapchat reported a second-quarter loss of 6 cents per share, much narrower than the loss of 22 cents per share forecast by analysts polled by Investing.com.
Revenue came in at $388 million, better than the $360 million expected.
Daily active users, a key measurement for engagement, were 203 million, better than the 192 million Wall Street was looking for.
The stock rose more than 11% in after-hours trading, adding to gains of nearly 5% in regular trading.
Looking ahead, Snap said it expect third-quarter revenue of $410 million to $435 million and an adjusted loss of $85 million to $60 million, both ahead of estimates from S&P Capital IQ.
Snap expects daily active users to be between 205 million and 207 million in the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen said.
After struggling last year with declines in users and high executive turnover, Snap finally returned to growth in the first quarter. In recent months, it scored wins with its augmented reality lenses and the launch of mobile games within Snapchat in partnership with game developers such as   Zynga Inc   (O:ZNGA).
One such lens, which allow users to change their gender in photos, has gone viral among Snapchat users.

(Reuters) - Shared office space manager WeWork is looking to go public as soon as September, earlier than previously expected, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
The company is expected to make its initial public offering paperwork public in August, the person said.
The developments were first reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.
WeWork declined to comment.
WeWork will host an analyst day for Wall Street banks on July 31 as part of preparations for its IPO, Reuters reported last week.
WeWork is also looking to raise $5 billion to $6 billion through a bond offering before the IPO, the source added, requesting anonymity because the matter is private. This is more than it had previously been looking to raise.
The debt offering could provide comfort to those investing in the IPO who might be concerned that the cash burn at WeWork is so great it will need to raise more money after the initial offering, which would dilute their shareholdings.
""That's a very known psychology by underwriters and IPO investors, and (that fear), that’s something people try to guard against,"" said Adam Troso, head of real estate corporate advisory at Greenhill & Co in New York.
WeWork was recently valued at $47 billion in a private fundraising round, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world.
However, the money-losing company has faced questions about the sustainability of its business model, which is based on short-term revenue agreements and long-term loan liabilities.
The losses at WeWork's parent company narrowed slightly in the first quarter of 2019 to $264 million as revenue continues to double annually."

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and aides were expected to leave for Shanghai on Monday, Bloomberg reported, with two days of talks scheduled. But the report suggested a deal wasn't near.
Nonetheless, the first face-to-face talks since May were good news for investors, already disposed to buying thanks to strong quarterly results from soft-drink giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), toymaker Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) and paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) and buying in Hershey (NYSE:HSY) ahead of its second-quarter earnings report due Thursday.
The S&P 500 jumped over 3,000 again and added 0.68%. The Dow Jones industrials also jumped 0.65%. And the Nasdaq Composite added 0.58%.
Wednesday could well be a drama-queen kind of day. Aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) reports second-quarter results before the open, and the earnings call will probably focus on issues besetting the grounded 737 Max jetliner. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reports second-quarter earnings after the close.
Lastly, traders will have a chance to react to a Wall Street Journal report that the Justice Department is opening a broad inquiry into whether dominant technology firms are unlawfully stifling competition. That could threaten Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google business, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the Journal said.
The probe will look at the practices of online platforms that dominate internet search, social media and retail services, the story said.
Shares of all four were higher (barely, in Facebook's case) in regular trading but were down about 1% each in after-hours trading.
Coca-Cola was the big Dow winner, hitting a 52-week high after handily beating Street estimates for the quarter. The company cited success with new and reformulated beverages.
Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) was the leader among S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 stocks, jumping nearly 10% and hitting a 52-week high as it said its tie-ins on products with Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) blockbuster films this summer have been highly successful and should continue for some time.
Twenty-two Nasdaq 100 stocks were lower on the day. Some, like Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), were modestly lower as some investors were ready to cash in profits. Both stocks have jumped more than 37% this year.
After the close, social-media company Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) shares were up more than 11% after losses narrowed and its user base grew in the latest quarter. Shares of chipmaker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) were up 5.6% after hours after it beat estimates, even if lower than a year ago.
The one downside to Tuesday's bullishness was a disappointing existing-home-sales report from the National Association of Realtors. The seasonally adjusted sales rate in June of 4.69 million units was off 1.5% from May and 1.7% from a year ago. Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said sales were back to 2015 levels.

(Reuters) - Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc provided some relief that a global slowdown in microchip demand would not be as long as feared, posting quarterly profit and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates on Tuesday.
Shares of the company rose 6.4% to $127.70 in extended trading and were on track to open at a record high on Wednesday.
The company had previously warned that the slowdown may last a few more quarters, as China's economy cools and manufacturers face the fallout of a prolonged U.S.-China trade dispute.
When asked whether the trade dispute was impacting the company's ability to conduct business in China, Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said, ""No, not at all"".
The market was also encouraged by the numbers from one of the first chipmakers to report earnings for the quarter, as there were uncertainties around demand due to higher tariffs and the fallout from China's Huawei Technologies.
Texas, whose broad lineup of products makes it a proxy for the chip industry, said it expected third-quarter revenue to be between $3.65 billion and $3.95 billion. The company also estimated a profit of between $1.31 and $1.53 per share.
Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $3.83 billion and profit of $1.38 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""Guidance reflects the improved sequential demand due to seasonality in all of its end-markets, offset by the on-going macro uncertainty,"" Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said.
Chan, however, expressed concerns about the continued choppy demand in industrial and automotive markets due to slowing growth in China.
Sales from industrial and automotive units, its fastest growing areas, together accounted for more than half of the company's revenue in 2018.
Net income fell to $1.31 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from $1.41 billion, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier.

(Reuters) - Snap Inc's Snapchat on Tuesday beat analysts' estimates for user growth and revenue, getting a boost from a better version of its Android app and the launch of new augmented reality photo lenses.
The company said the number of daily active users rose to 203 million in the second quarter ended June 30 from 190 million in the prior quarter. The user metric was also up from 188 million a year earlier.
Shares of Snap jumped 9% to $16.29 in after-hours trading.
The AR lenses, which are filters that can overlay everything from bunny ears to freckles onto a user's photo, went viral when it introduced a lens that let users switch their gender in photos.
The latest daily active user figure, widely watched by investors and advertisers, beat analysts' average estimate of 192.2 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
After struggling last year with declines in users and high executive turnover, Snap finally returned to growth in the first quarter.
In recent months, it scored wins with its augmented reality lenses, launched mobile games within Snapchat in partnership with game developers such as Zynga Inc and invested in more content on Discover, the part of the app that houses original shows and content from media partners.
""The popularity of these lenses drew millions of people into our rebuilt Android application, where they experienced the new and improved Snapchat that led to increased engagement,"" Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said on the earnings call with analysts.
Snap's revenue, which it earns from selling advertising on the app, jumped about 48% to $388 million and beat Wall Street's average estimate of $359.7 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Snapchat has been largely untouched by privacy issues plaguing  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google's YouTube, two of Snap's rivals for digital ad dollars, because of its disappearing messages that make it difficult to broadcast misinformation or unsavory content.
Snap expects daily active users to be between 205 million and 207 million in the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen said.
Of the 13 million daily active users Snap gained during the second quarter, 7 million to 9 million were from the new augmented reality lenses, Andersen said.
Analysts questioned whether Snap could retain the new users it gained from the lenses, during the earnings call.
Spiegel said the lenses not only attracted new users but re-engaged returning users.
It is unclear if Snap can continue having hits like viral lenses every quarter, ""but if you can keep engagement going, that's the key,"" said Ron Josey, an analyst with JMP Securities. Average revenue per user jumped more than 36% to $1.91 in the quarter.
Snap emphasized its investment in content on Discover, which increased the time spent on the app by 60% compared with last year, said Kamal Khan, an analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.
""That trend will continue in the near and medium term, but just like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), it’s betting a lot on content against rivals with much, much deeper pockets,"" he said.
Net loss narrowed to $255.2 million, or 19 cents per share, from $353.3 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company lost 6 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 10 cents per share.
Snap expects third quarter revenue in the range of $410 million to $435 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $402.1 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
1670,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 06:53PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Deutsche Bank's problem derivatives cloud recovery - sources,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  AG's (DE:DBKGn) turnaround strategy rests in large part on shedding 288 billion euros of unwanted assets. Three bank insiders said it will take years, tying up capital that could have generated income of 500 million euros ($557 million) a year.
The opportunity cost of unloading the assets, which has not been previously reported, underscores the challenges facing Chief Executive Christian Sewing as he attempts to turn around the bank and restore confidence among investors who have seen the value of their shares decline by 75% in the past four years.
Sewing said earlier this month that Deutsche, Germany's largest lender, would set up a bad bank to house the assets, which include equity, credit and interest-rate derivatives. The bank said it wants to offload most of its derivatives by 2020. Executives managing the book can either sell positions or allow them to gradually wind down over time, depending on which is more profitable. 
The bank is planning an auction of its short-dated equity derivatives book, having already received ""significant expressions of interest,"" the sources familiar with the matter said. However, its long-dated interest rate and credit derivatives are expected to be much harder to offload, the sources said. 
Deutsche Bank has held on-and-off talks with potential buyers of some of those assets over the past two years, three people said. The sales did not happen because the prices offered would have resulted in hundreds of millions of euros in losses for the bank, they said. 
The bank's decision to maintain the derivatives, rather than sell them at current market values, was strategic, Group Treasurer Dixit Joshi told Reuters Tuesday. He declined to comment on the 500 million euro figure.    
""The metric we look at is how much capital are we freeing up from the capital release unit, net of any costs attached to that,"" he said. ""At the end of the process, the CRU (capital release unit) will release substantial capital that allows us to undertake the restructuring."" 
The derivatives themselves are not creating losses, but global regulations introduced following the financial crisis have forced the bank to hold more capital against them, which means Deutsche Bank cannot use those dollars for more profitable investments, the people said. 
The 500 million euro figure is measured by how much the capital requirement is dragging on Deutsche Bank's return on tangible equity, the people said. It is a key measure of how much profit a bank generates from shareholder funds. 
Derivatives profits are often booked in their entirety when trades are made. But the assets sit on a bank's books for the duration, meaning the bank must hold capital against them and take gains or losses as markets affect values. 
""NO NEED FOR A FIRE SALE""
Deutsche Bank's derivatives plan is part of a broader restructuring, in which it will shed 18,000 jobs worldwide.
The full extent of the bank's derivatives exposure is still being assessed as the bank examines each position being placed in the bad bank, said the people, who include senior Deutsche Bank staff in New York and London.
It is doubtful that the bank would be able to sell the positions in their entirety without taking a large write-down requiring the bank to raise capital from shareholders, the three people said.
When it announced its restructuring plan, Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the likely cost of offloading problem assets. However, it categorically ruled out a capital raise.
""We're confident we will fund our transformation within our existing resources,"" Joshi told Reuters. 
Deutsche Bank has already done four capital raises totaling 29.3 billion euros since 2010. It is uncertain investors would be willing to pony up yet more cash.
Sewing hopes to free up capital that can be returned to shareholders while retaining profitable businesses such as transaction banking. The bank wants to begin returning 5 billion euros of capital to shareholders in 2022.
Deutsche Bank has said that its capital levels will fall while it winds down assets in its bad bank and has regulatory approval for its common equity to drop from its current level of just over 13.5% to 12.5%. It is unclear if its supervisors would tolerate a decline below that.
Deutsche Bank built up its derivatives book during a time of aggressive expansion when it wanted to compete with Wall Street giants such as Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). The size of the book peaked in 2011, and has fallen since. 
Joshi said the bank can avoid deep discounts in shedding the derivatives. ""We have no need for a fire sale given the quality of the assets and the run-down profile,"" he said. 
Many investors remain skeptical.    

""They are not in a position to mark these things down and sell them off because they don't have the capital to spare and it's not clear where the next capital injection will come from,"" said Ali Miremadi, portfolio manager at shareholder GAM. ""Really, they have no choice but to sit there and wait for them to unwind.""

The maker of Snapchat reported a second-quarter loss of 6 cents per share, much narrower than the loss of 22 cents per share forecast by analysts polled by Investing.com.
Revenue came in at $388 million, better than the $360 million expected.
Daily active users, a key measurement for engagement, were 203 million, better than the 192 million Wall Street was looking for.
The stock rose more than 11% in after-hours trading, adding to gains of nearly 5% in regular trading.
Looking ahead, Snap said it expect third-quarter revenue of $410 million to $435 million and an adjusted loss of $85 million to $60 million, both ahead of estimates from S&P Capital IQ.
Snap expects daily active users to be between 205 million and 207 million in the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen said.
After struggling last year with declines in users and high executive turnover, Snap finally returned to growth in the first quarter. In recent months, it scored wins with its augmented reality lenses and the launch of mobile games within Snapchat in partnership with game developers such as   Zynga Inc   (O:ZNGA).
One such lens, which allow users to change their gender in photos, has gone viral among Snapchat users.

Lighthizer and a small team will be in Shanghai through Wednesday, according to people familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified. The meeting will involve a broad discussion of the issues outstanding and isn’t expected to yield major breakthroughs, a senior administration official said.
President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met at the Group of 20 summit in Japan last month and declared a tentative truce in their year-long trade war. The leaders directed their negotiators to resume trade talks. Since then Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Lighthizer and their Chinese counterparts have spoken by phone.
According to a senior administration official, the Chinese requested that the meeting take place in Shanghai, rather than Beijing.
Stocks jumped to their high for the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.6% as of 2:45 p.m. in New York.
Structural Issues
U.S. officials have played down the likelihood of a quick deal with China.
“It is impossible to judge how long it will take when the president’s objective is to get a proper deal or go ahead with tariffs,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. “It is not important whether it be done a week from Tuesday or a month or two months.”
The sides remain at odds over significant issues like Washington’s demands for structural reforms to China’s economy and Beijing’s call for the U.S. to remove existing punitive tariffs on imported Chinese goods.
The talks in recent weeks have focused on Huawei licenses and agriculture purchases, and lacked engagement on structural issues that the U.S. wants addressed in any trade deal.
People familiar with next week’s meeting say it’s a positive step for talks overall but caution that it’s likely to feature a wide-ranging discussion of where things stand, rather than a chance for substantive negotiations. It’s still unclear what the starting point will be for deeper discussions. Talks collapsed in May because the two countries disagreed on draft terms of a deal.
Trade Negotiators
The meeting will be the first time that China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan joins the core group of negotiators, which on the Chinese side has been led by Vice Premier Liu He.
Zhong is seen as more of a hardliner than Liu and some China watchers say he was added to the talks to ensure that a more hawkish view is represented at the table. Zhong is a known quantity for many U.S. officials, including Lighthizer who has met him several times over the past two years at international meetings such as Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summits.
On Monday, Trump and senior White House officials, including Mnuchin and Lighthizer, met with chief executives of U.S. technology companies in a step toward easing a ban on sales to China’s Huawei Technologies Co., which has been another point of tension in the relationship.
National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told reporters Tuesday that the meeting was positive and cited it as one reason he’s optimistic that in-person talks with China were likely to resume soon.

By David Randall and Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bond fund managers Kathleen Gaffney and Henry Peabody left  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Corp at the end of June and have been replaced by existing members of the firm's fixed-income team, a spokeswoman told Reuters.
Among other duties, the pair managed the $364 million Eaton Vance Multisector Income fund, whose 6.1% annualized return over the last 3 years puts it in the top 8th percentile among the 296 funds in its Morningstar category. Over the last year, however, the fund has returned 3.2%, dropping it into the 97th percentile among its peers over that time period.
Peabody told Reuters he has since joined MFS Investment Management, while Gaffney said separately that she is still in the process of determining to which firm she will move.
Eaton Vance said the two left to pursue ""other opportunities"" and Gaffney and Peabody would not say why they left.
The management shakeup does not affect the fund's rating, Morningstar wrote in a report. The fund currently has a negative process pillar rating due to its concentrated risks.
""While it is possible that there will be changes to the approach under its new management team, there is not enough information to revisit the Process rating at this point,"" the report said.
Gaffney joined Eaton Vance in 2012 after co-managing the then-$22 billion Loomis Sayles Bond Fund with investor Dan Fuss."

Shares of LSC were down to $2.22 in heavy trading, while Quad/Graphics shares were up 7.9% at $8.20.
Quad/Graphics had said in October it would buy LSC Communications in an all-stock deal, bringing together two of the biggest companies that print books, magazines and catalogs.
""This result is a victory for American consumers and publishers, and a testament to the Division’s resolve to enforce the antitrust laws,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who heads the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement.
""Had this merger gone forward, it would have harmed competition that benefits publishers, retailers, and, ultimately, consumers through lower prices and greater availability of printed products from popular books to grade school textbooks.""
Wisconsin-based Quad/Graphics had revenue of $4.2 billion in 2018, while LSC Communications Inc, which was spun off by printing firm R.R. Donnelley in 2016, had revenues of $3.8 billion last year.
""We disagree with the DoJ's conclusion regarding our transaction, especially in the context of industry trends,"" LSC Chief Executive Officer Thomas Quinlan said.
Quinlan said the companies decided to terminate the deal because of the cost and time involved in challenging the Department of Justice.
The Justice Department had said the two companies were each other's biggest rivals, citing internal documents that refer to a price war and a ""two-horse race between LSC and Quad.""
In its complaint, filed in federal court in Illinois, the Justice Department had said Quad and LSC were the only realistic option for many publishers because of their complex printing equipment.
It cited at least one bidding war between the two that resulted in the offer of a $10 million signing bonus.
Quad/Graphics said it will pay LSC a reverse termination fee of $45 million while LSC Communications said it would suspend its quarterly dividend in order to bring down its debt and fund its restructuring programs.
LSC said suspending the dividend will allow the company to redeploy about $35 million in cash annually.
LSC also cut its full-year sales forecast as well as its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) forecast range due to a drop in demand in its magazines, catalogs and logistics segment."
