Think about all the profits reaped by those who were able to take advantage of the major trends of the last decade like cloud computing, e-commerce, and smartphones. Many believe that the next big trend in the next decade will be space. Here’s why Trimble (TRMB) is the top space stock.The impact of technological breakthroughs aren’t always easy to appreciate when they’re emerging but with the benefit of hindsight, we can fully understand their significance.
Think about Steve Jobs introducing the first Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone in 2007, which has changed multiple aspects of how people live, socialize, and do business. Or, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) launching AWS which made high-power computing affordable and accessible for everybody. 
I believe a similar breakthrough is Elon Musk and SpaceX’s successful space launch, which is lowering the cost of space travel and exploration. Many analysts believe that space will be the next great investing frontier and has the potential to grow into more than a $1 trillion industry over the next decade. While there are a variety of stocks that will benefit from this trend, I believe that Trimble, Inc. (TRMB) is the best choice.

1,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 10:26AM ET</span>","Aldi to hire more than 20,000 U.S. workers ahead of holiday season","(Reuters) - Grocery chain Aldi said on Monday it is hiring more than 20,000 new workers and raising its wages in the United States as it gets ready for the busy holiday season at a time when retailers and restaurants are scrambling to find workers.
The U.S. arm of the German discount supermarket group said it has increased its average national starting wages for store and warehouse workers to $15 and $19 per hour, respectively.
Aldi will host a hiring week in September to fill an array of positions, including cashiers, stockers and associates, at its more than 2,100 stores and 25 warehouses across the country.
The company is one of the first retailers to announce hiring for the holiday season, which could account for up to 40% of annual sales for certain retailers.

Several restaurant operators have been forced to cut their operating hours and limit operations to drive-thru only due to labor shortages, while retailers have had to increase wages and offer $1,000 sign-on bonuses to lure workers.
However, Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) Co Chief Executive Officer Todd Penegor said on an earnings call last week that the hamburger chain had seen an improvement in staffing as federal benefits rolled off and schools closed for the summer.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Saudi Aramco (SE:2222) is looking to raise at least $17 billion from the sale of a significant minority stake in its gas pipelines, higher than the $12.4 billion raised from its oil pipeline deal, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Potential bidders including North American private equity and infrastructure funds, as well as state-backed funds in China and South Korea have been approached by Aramco through its advisors before a formal sale process kicks off in the next few weeks, they said.
The deal size may include $3.5 billion of equity and the remainder will be funded by bank debt, one source said, while another source said the transaction size could top $20 billion.
Saudi Arabia is the world's sixth largest gas market,according to Aramco, whose Master Gas System (MGS) derives valuefrom a range of gas deposits and helps deliver it to consumers. 
""The gas deal is about the long-term view of gas utilisation and consumption in Saudi Arabia,"" said one source familiar with deal, explaining why the gas deal may generate higher proceeds.
The source said many industries will shift to gas under the economic Vision 2030, meaning domestic gas demand will rise.
Aramco is working with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on the deal to tap potential buyers, sources have said.
The companies tapped include the ones who took part in the stake sale process for Abu Dhabi National Oil Co's gas pipelines, which was bought by a consortium of investors including Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), Brookfield, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and European gas infrastructure owner and operator SNAM .
Aramco, JPMorgan and Goldman declined to comment.
Brookfield and SNAM declined to comment. GIP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other potential bidders showing interest in the Aramco sales process include China's Silk Road, Chinese state-backed investment fund CNIC Corp, South Korea's sovereign wealth fund Korean Investment Corp (KIC) and NH Investment & Securities, sources said.

KIC declined to comment, while the other companies did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Aramco, similar to Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), used a lease and lease-back agreement to sell a 49% stake of newly formed Aramco Oil Pipelines Co to the buyer and rights to 25 years of tariff payments for oil carried on its pipelines.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 10:01AM ET</span>","Sydney Airport rejects improved $16.8 billion buyout bid, open to higher offer","By Jamie Freed and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Sydney Airport Holdings Pty Ltd on Monday rejected an improved A$22.80 billion ($16.81 billion) bid from a group of infrastructure investors, saying that it undervalued the airport operator, but that it was open to a higher offer.
The new offer valued Sydney Airport at A$8.45 per share, 2.4% higher than the previous offer of A$8.25 a share, and a more than 9% premium to the stock's Friday close. 
Shares were steady in afternoon trading on Monday, with the increased price below market expectations of closer to A$9 a share.
A successful takeover would be among the largest buyouts ever of an Australian firm and underline a year of stellar deal activity, that has already seen a mega $29 billion buyout of Afterpay by Square.
But it would require Sydney Airport to allow due diligence as well as receiving approvals from shareholders, the competition regulator and the Foreign Investment Review Board, a process that typically takes months.
The unanimous board rejection comes a month after the airport operator turned down an initial bid from the Sydney Aviation Alliance (SAA), a consortium of Australian investors IFM Investors and QSuper and U.S.-based Global Infrastructure Partners.
Record-low interest rates have prompted pension funds and their investment managers to chase higher yields.
Australia's largest pension fund, AustralianSuper, has joined the consortium, Sydney Airport said, in a move that could make it tougher for a rival offer to emerge given the requirement for 51% Australian control of the airport. 
UniSuper, Sydney Airport's biggest shareholder with a 15.3% stake, has indicated it is open to rolling that equity into an investment in the privatised company, as required as part of the bid conditions.
Sydney Airport said its board was open to engaging with the Sydney Aviation Alliance if the consortium lifts its indicative price ""to appropriately recognise long term value for Sydney Airport securityholders.""
SAA said in a statement that given Sydney Airport's lack of engagement and immediate rejection of the revised proposal it appeared unlikely that the parties could agree on a path forward, so there was no assurance a deal would be completed.
""The critical thing is they (SAA) haven't used 'final' and they haven't walked away, so they continue to engage with each other,"" Macquarie research analyst Ian Myles said.
Macquarie's analysts said that given the high value of the property within Sydney Airport and low interest rates, a valuation of A$8.75 was obtainable. 
Sydney Airport is Australia's only listed airport operator and a purchase would be a long-term bet on the travel sector which has been battered by the pandemic. 
Australia's international border remains closed and Sydney is in its eighth week of lockdown after an outbreak of the Delta variant of COVID-19 that SAA said would have led to shares falling ""materially below"" the A$5.75 closing price before the announcement of its first buyout proposal. 
Nevertheless, analysts and investors believe there is scope for a higher price given the strong long-term outlook for the airport operator.
""If they'd gotten a bit closer to at least the high A$8 level, that might have prompted the board (but) 20 cents is not much really,"" said an Sydney Airport investor who was not authorised to be named publicly. ""Shareholders are prepared to entertain the proposal but it probably has to be closer to A$9.""
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Paul Butler said in a note that AustralianSuper's involvement in the consortium limited the potential for competing bids due to foreign ownership and airport cross-ownership restrictions.

Sydney Airport is due to report its first-half financial results on Friday.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 09:56AM ET</span>","""UK for sale"": Britain's year of private equity buyouts","By Joice Alves and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - This year's unprecedented private equity buying spree in Britain is causing unease among politicians, trade unions and investors, about potential job losses and rising debt. 
But generous price premia are also raising asset managers' expectations of higher share prices for the London stock market after years of underperformance.
An $9.5 billion bid underway by Fortress Investment Group for British grocery chain Morrisons is just one such private equity acquisition, which, according to Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management, have accounted for 85% of British take-private deals this year. 
Here are five charts showing private equity's hunt for UK-listed corporates.
1/RECORD RAIDS
Buyout groups spent $45 billion snapping up companies in Britain in the first half of 2021, Refinitiv data shows, more than double the next best first six months on record and almost 10% of the total $547 billion they spent across the world. 
Private equity raid on UK Inc https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-PRIVATEEQUITY/BUYOUT/xmvjoogrdpr/chart.png 
Peel Hunt data in July showed 38 London-listed companies had either been acquired by private equity this year or were in the process of being acquired. Apart from Morrisons, these include Dubilier & Rice and KKR's acquisition of infrastructure firm John Laing Group.
The deals keep coming with Advent-owned defence firm Cobham agreeing on Monday a $3.6 billion takeover of Ultra Electronics, while CVC and London-listed Stock Spirits announced a roughly $1 billion deal late last week.
Grace Peters, EMEA head of investment strategy at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Private Bank called private equity interest in UK companies ""comforting"", saying that when you invest in equities ""you want to know there is an incremental buyer"". 
2/FOR SALE, CHEAP COMPANIES
The attraction for cash-rich private equity is obvious. 
While U.S. and European stock indexes have gained 65% and 25% respectively since August 2018, the FTSE 100 index is down 8% and trading at just 12.6 times forward earnings. That compares to 21 times and 16.3 times respectively for the U.S. and European benchmarks. 
UK stocks cheaper than U.S. and European shares https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjpqkkqebpx/UK%20stocks%20cheaper%20than%20U.S.%20and%20European%20shares.png 
British stocks' discount to global peers is the deepest in over three decades. 
PE discount: UK vs World https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdpxoywmmvx/Capture.PNG 
Brexit is one reason. The mining, energy and banking shares typical of the FTSE 100 have cheaper valuations than tech as their performance hinges on a clearly positive growth outlook.
But even smaller, domestically focused British stocks, trading at 13.2 times forward earnings, lag the U.S. midcap average of 17.6 times. 
Janus Henderson portfolio manager Tom O'Hara says UK valuations are often unjustifiably cheap even when companies are hugely cash-generative.
""UK for sale is very much an ongoing theme and it will remain so until the market becomes a lot better valued,"" he said. ""If the market refuses to value a company appropriately, private equity will come and take it off your hands on the cheap."" 
3/NOT THAT CHEAP?
Shareholders in Morrisons will reap a 40%-plus premium should its buyout proceed at 270 pence per share - in line with the average premium offered this year by private equity firms, Peel Hunt analysis shows. 
Private equity juicy premium on valuations https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-PRIVATEEQUITY/BUYOUTS/gdvzyyrnqpw/chart.png 
4/PUBLIC TO PRIVATE
The laws of supply and demand dictate that take-private deals will support share prices by removing equity from the market, even if the amount withdrawn is dwarfed by the 2.4 trillion-pound FTSE 350 index. 
Companies taken private from January to July represented 11 billion pounds in market cap, Peel Hunt estimates. That will rise to more than 26 billion pounds and remove almost 13 billion shares from the public market if all the deals announced in the period complete. 
Private equity top UK targets https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-PRIVATEEQUITY/BUYOUT/mopannmqxva/chart.png 
""There's a lot of money coming back in for fund managers to deploy, and a lot of that will be repositioned in companies currently listed in the UK or provide firepower for fundraising for IPOs,"" said Charles Hall, Peel Hunt's head of research.
There is unease too. Kiran Ganesh, London-based head of multi-asset at UBS Global Wealth Management, cautioned that policymakers need to ensure ""the best opportunities don't go private and public markets are just what's left over"". 
ARBITRAGE
Buyouts are creating what Justin Onuekwusi, portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management, calls arbitrage opportunities between public and private markets as investors jostle for shares in potential takeover targets. 
""Allocating to the cheaper asset classes will eventually pay off if you're willing to be patient,"" he told the Reuters Global Markets forum. 
The Morrisons deal has lifted shares in rivals Sainsbury's and Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), while Berenberg analysts have a Buy rating on listed real estate companies Capital & Counties, Helical and Grainger as it considers them attractive to private equity buyers. 

Janus Henderson's O'Hara holds several companies with valuations he reckons make them attractive takeover targets, including Premier Inns operator  Whitbread  (LON:WTB), Sainsbury's, chemicals firm Johnson Mathey and DIY firm  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF).
""It's a simple case of financial arbitrage being left open by the market,"" he said.

6,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 09:38AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Lower; Tesla in Spotlight Amid Safety Probe; Dow Down 160 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Monday amid concerns over slower growth in China and faster viral spread in the U.S.
Data released overnight showed the Chinese economy slowed markedly in July, against a backdrop of characteristically aggressive efforts to stamp out local outbreaks of Covid-19 in China. The measures are yet to succeed in full, and one of the terminals at Nangbo-Zhonshuan, the world's third-largest container port, remains shut on Monday after being closed last week.
China's industrial production and retail sales growth both came in below expectations for July, with output growing at its slowest rate since September last year and sales growth at a six-month low.  The data also revealed a clear drop in Chinese fuel demand in response to the latest wave of lockdown measures, something that pushed crude oil prices more than 1% lower earlier on Monday.
The U.S., meanwhile, registered its worst week for new cases of Covid-19 since February last week, with the average daily case load rising to over 124,000.  The latest wave of cases helped trigger a sharp drop in U.S. consumer confidence, according to data released Friday, casting doubt on the achievability of herd immunity. Fears of a slowing economy pushed the 10-year Treasury bond yield down to 1.25% despite a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that the Federal Reserve is preparing a more rapid end to its asset purchases than many have expected. The WSJ suggested that the Fed would look to start tapering bond purchases in September and finish by June next year.
By 10:20 AM ET (1420 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 164 points, or 0.5%, at 35,352 points, having closed last week at a record high. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite were down 1.2%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock grabbed headlines for the wrong reasons in early trading, falling over 4% after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had started an investigation into the company's Autopilot software and its role in nearly 20 crashes since 2018, many of them involving emergency vehicles. It's the most serious action taken in years by the NHTSA against Tesla, and comes after criticism even from the National Transportation Safety Board of its relaxed approach to policing the company.
It was a rough morning for vaccine makers, which continued to give back some of the lavish gains they had made in previous weeks.BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock fell 14.7%, while  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 9.9% and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock rose 9.6%. The stocks had all reached record highs on speculation that much of the rich world will endorse 'booster shots' against Covid-19.
Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) stock bucked the broader trend, rising 7% to a four-month high after an important patent lawsuit victory over Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Friday, which was announced after the market close.
Oatly ADRs (NASDAQ:OTLY) was another rare name in the green, rising 4.2% after the vegan milk maker raised its revenue forecast for the full year. Its net loss was wider than expected however, and the rise comes after the stock touched an all-time low last week.

The investigation covers an estimated 765,000 Tesla Model Y, Model X, Model S, Model 3 vehicles.

Investing.com – Sonos stock (NASDAQ:SONO) climbed 9% in Monday’s premarket after a U.S. trade judge ruled that that some of Google’s Pixel smartphones and Nest audio speakers infringe on the company’s technology and could be barred from import.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has denied Sonos’s patent-infringement claims, contending it developed the technologies its products use.
Sonos has been pursuing Google to strike a royalty agreement for a portfolio of patents.
A full commission will review Friday's order by December. The Biden administration can accept the ruling and allow a potential import ban or drop the matter, citing public interest.
Last week, Sonos revised its annual guidance for the second time after work-from-home boosted sales of its speakers and other audio products.
Revenue in the second quarter increased 52% year-over-year to $378.7 million. Net income was $17.8 million compared to a loss of $56.98 million.
The company now sees its revenue in the range of $1.69 billion to $1.71 billion, a growth of 28%-29% year-over-year. It had earlier revised it to $1.62 billion-$1.67 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA is now seen between $270 million and $280 million."

11,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 07:41AM ET</span>",Analysis-U.S. SEC prepares to take on corporate America over workforce disclosures,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is headed for a scuffle with corporate America over how much information public companies must disclose about their most important asset: employees. 
Urged on by progressive Democrats, unions and investors, the regulator is working on a rule that will require public companies to disclose more information on their workforces, such as data on diversity, staff compensation and employee turnover. 
As companies depend less on physical assets and more on employees, including gig workers and contractors, such ""human capital"" data provides crucial insight into corporate strategy and governance issues, investors and employee advocates say. 
The issue has become more urgent as the pandemic and social justice movements force companies to review working conditions, pay equity, hiring and retention policies, they say.
""As many companies are fond of saying, 'their employees are their greatest asset.' But investors are being kept in the dark about how companies are treating their workforce,"" said Brandon Rees, a deputy director at the AFL-CIO, the country's largest federation of unions. 
""Improved workforce disclosure will help investors better understand which companies are creating good jobs and investing in their employees,"" said Rees, adding that he had recently spoken with the SEC to discuss a new rule. 
Public companies worry, however, that such data could prove embarrassing, create legal risks or be exploited by labor unions, and have already started to push back. 
""There is a general hesitancy on the part of the employer community about what the information will be used for,"" said Amanda Sonneborn, a partner at law firm King & Spalding who advises corporations on labor relations. ""Employers do not want to be shamed.""
Companies were required to disclose only staff headcount until the SEC, under former President Donald Trump's administration, last year introduced a rule requiring them to disclose workforce information that they deem material. 
That rule, effective last November, has proven to be too vague and has not yielded meaningful data, according to some studies.
Of 100 big company annual disclosures analyzed by Stanford Business School, for example, most adopted boilerplate language and only 43% provided quantitative metrics. Few provided data on issues that affect strategy and productivity, such as talent recruitment, training, retention and incentive systems, according to the May study https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/human-capital-disclosure-what-do-companies-say-about-their-most. 
Such information is increasingly material for investors, who may need it to make better capital allocation and voting decisions, said George Georgiev, a business law professor at Emory University. Specific disclosure requirements could provide ""consistent, comparable and reliable information that current disclosures do not exhibit,"" he said. 
The SEC is likely to mandate specific human capital metrics, which SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/sec-considers-disclosure-mandate-range-climate-metrics-2021-06-23 could include workforce turnover, skills and development training, compensation, benefits, workforce demographics and health and safety.
With respect to demographic data, an increasingly important issue for investors, the metrics are likely to include race, gender, sexuality, age and physical ability, according to groups pushing for the changes and two sources with direct knowledge of the agency's thinking. 
""We should think carefully about including a handful of common-sense, readily accessible metrics, especially in areas of significant consensus such as workforce diversity,"" Democratic Commissioner Allison Lee told Reuters in an interview.
A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment.
CORPORATE PUSHBACK
The SEC's renewed focus on human capital is part of a broader push by President Joe Biden's administration to promote better environmental and social corporate governance and racial equity, increasingly sensitive issues for companies.
Corporate America's white-dominated leadership came under a spotlight https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-corporatediversity/the-heats-on-corporate-america-to-reveal-racial-diversity-data-idUSKBN2431JY last year for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement while disclosing little on corporate diversity. But executives privately fret that very stringent or detailed disclosures could be reputationally damaging. 
The data may also be used by employees and unions to build discrimination suits or to mobilize organized labor campaigns that may not be in the best interest of investors, they say.
The SEC is expected to unveil the draft rule by year end and seek feedback. But corporate groups have already raised concerns in public letters and in private meetings with the SEC, according to published meeting memos and people with knowledge of the discussions. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has discussed with SEC staff whether a new rule is even necessary, given the November rule is barely a year old, said Tom Quaadman, executive vice president with the group. 
""The SEC should just take a little bit of a pause here to see how this new system is actually working before determining whether it should be changed,"" he said, adding that similar data is already required by other federal regulators. 
Companies say the rules would add to their already onerous disclosure requirements, and that any changes should focus on material issues, which have traditionally been the SEC's threshold for corporate disclosures, rather than nice-to-haves. 
Since the materiality of the data will vary depending on the company and sector, the new rule should be flexible and require broad rather than prescriptive metrics, they argue.

But Emory's Georgiev said Gensler, who has a history of taking on business interests, is unlikely to give companies too much leeway. 
""A more detailed rule can still be crafted to align with the SEC's historical and materiality-based approach,"" he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Monday, falling back from the previous session’s record levels as rising Covid cases stunt the global economic recovery, particularly in China. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 100 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 35 points, or 0.2%.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average posted gains of 0.8% last week, closing at a record, while the S&P 500 finished Friday up 0.7% for the week, also notching its best-ever finish. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed during the week, down just under 0.1%.
The main indices have been supported by a strong quarterly earnings season, with FactSet calculating that 87% of S&P 500 companies have reported positive earnings surprises, the highest percentage since the data company began tracking this metric in 2008.
That said, sentiment has turned more cautious Monday as investors digested signs China’s economic recovery was losing momentum, with both industrial production and retail sales rising more slowly than expected in July, as new Covid-19 outbreaks disrupted business.
The number of coronavirus cases is also growing in the U.S., with the delta variant, which is rapidly spreading among mostly the unvaccinated portion of the U.S. population, causing hospitalizations to spike in recent weeks.
Also causing wariness Monday is the turmoil in Afghanistan with the Taliban overrunning the capital Kabul over the weekend, prompting President Ashraf Ghani to flee the country.
There’s little in the way of significant economic data due Monday, but Tuesday’s U.S. retail sales data will be studied to see if the Covid outbreak has impacted consumer spending patterns.
Additionally, the Fed Reserve’s minutes of its July meeting are released on Wednesday, and will be carefully scrutinized, particularly after a Wall Street Journal report claiming that the central bank is looking at ending its asset purchases by the middle of next year.
In corporate news, Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) will be in the spotlight after the hotel operator announced a  deal to buy resort company Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Leisure Group from private-equity firms KKR and KSL Capital Partners for $2.7 billion in cash.
Elsewhere, oil prices fell by over 1% Monday on concerns mobility restrictions in China, the second largest importer of crude in the world, will hit fuel demand.
China's daily crude throughput last month fell to the lowest since May 2020 as independent refiners slashed production, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. That was the first year-on-year decline since March last year when the coronavirus hit hard.

Investing.com – Hyatt Hotels stock (NYSE:H) was down 0.6% in Monday’s premarket trading a day after the company said it plans to buy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Leisure Group for $2.7 billion from affiliates of each of KKR and KSL Capital Partners.
Apple Leisure is a leading luxury resort-management services, travel and hospitality group and its acquisition deepens Hyatt’s portfolio of asset-light business. Resort management services need less clash and are built on a brand’s best-in-class practices.
The acquisition will expand Hyatt’s presence in luxury leisure travel and immediately add approximately 33,000 rooms, 100 hotels in 10 countries and a pipeline of 24 executed deals in Europe and the Americas to its portfolio.
The deal comes at a time when travel has come roaring back after the pandemic even as it has run into fresh hiccups with the spread of the delta variant.
KKR and KSL bought the company from Bain Capital in 2016 with the goal of expanding its vertically integrated platform. Apple Leisure subsequently did its own acquisitions, agreeing to merge with The Mark Travel in 2018 and then acquiring a majority share in Spain’s Alua Hotels & Resorts in the same year.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>","Analysis-Back with a bang, share buybacks offer boost for Europe Inc","By Danilo Masoni and Sujata Rao
MILAN (Reuters) - Europe's record-breaking earnings season has shown a sharp rise in the number of companies repurchasing their stock, raising investor hopes of big U.S.-style returns in a market that has historically focused on dividend payouts rather than buybacks.
The buyback announcements stood out even amid Europe Inc's near-150% quarterly profit surge, the best since Refinitiv IBES records began in 2012 and analysts reckon they offer a further tailwind for the pan-European STOXX 600 index, already at record highs.
Analysis by market intelligence provider Alphasense shows 808 mentions of buybacks on earnings calls during the 180 days to Aug. 2, a 4% year-on-year rise and the strongest reading since late-2016. 
In the United States, where rewarding investors by repurchasing shares is far more common than in Europe, stock markets have risen almost three times as much as European peers did over the past decade. 
How much of that outperformance is tied to differing investor remuneration practices is hard to extrapolate. But it stems at least partly from buybacks, which increase demand and reduce supply for a company's shares. Also by decreasing the number of shares outstanding, they boost earnings per share, even when total net income is flat.
A sustained move towards buybacks would be momentous for Europe, potentially allowing shares to re-rate sharply, says Tom O'Hara, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, though he warns that one set of buybacks would not be a ""silver bullet"".
Investors had to be convinced buybacks would be ""part of the DNA of the company"", O'Hara said, adding: ""The market does need to get that little bit of extra comfort that this is something management teams are serious about and will stick with"".
A raft of companies and sectors have announced repurchases -- from retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) starting its first buyback in a decade to a $2.2 billion programme by steel giant ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), which turned the page on years of investor neglect.
The list includes oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG), chipmaker STMicro and food group Danone. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently raised its forecasts for European and UK share prices, citing buybacks as one reason. Another bank Berenberg suggested the return of buybacks could help European insurers catch up with U.S. peers after a 10 percentage-point underperformance so far in 2021. 
Graphic: Buyback - EU transcript mentions, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klvykeymavg/EU%20transcript%20mentions.PNG 
CHANGE
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates at least $35 billion (30 billion euros) worth of buyback programmes were announced this reporting season and expects 2021 activity to exceed the prior $100 billion peak set in 2019.
""Something is changing: more companies are announcing bigger buybacks and I think this will continue...It can be a growth stock, a value stock, a cyclical stock,"" Morgan Stanley's chief European equity strategist Graham (NYSE:GHM) Secker said. 
That figure still pales in comparison to Wall Street where S&P 500 companies carried out $200 billion in buybacks in the second quarter, following $178 billion in the first quarter, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) analyst Howard Silverblatt.
The analytics firm calculated last year that 53% of U.S. corporates had share buyback programmes in 2018, versus 28% in 1980. Meanwhile the proportion of dividend-payers almost halved in the same period to 43% in 2018 from 78%.
In Europe, just 26% of firms have buyback programmes. 
DIVIDENDS VERSUS BUYBACKS
Some analysts such as Grace Peters, EMEA head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, see a structural change as unlikely. 
""Many European corporates look at their share price and think 'why do I have a lower valuation than the U.S.?' but the European model does not lend itself to pursuing shareholder returns via buybacks,"" she said, noting for instance that unlike in the United States, European CEO remuneration is rarely linked to share performance.
The repurchase flood may stem too from companies' record post-pandemic cash piles, estimated by Janus Henderson at $5.3 trillion globally. And unlike dividends, buybacks do not necessarily represent a long-term commitment.
Finally, European pension funds and insurance firms often rely on dividend income especially with most bond yields stuck below 0%.
Morgan Stanley's Secker, however, said such funds would benefit from higher share prices, while even a reduced dividend income would compare favourably with bond yields.
""So you can actually still give your investor a relatively attractive (dividend) yield or income but at the same time boost your growth rate by shrinking your share base,"" he said.
Shares in companies repurchasing stock are outperforming.

A European buyback index compiled by Solactive has risen almost 30% this year, versus 18% gains on a benchmark of dividend payers' shares. Similarly, the S&P 500 buyback index with a 28% gain, is well ahead of a dividend aristocrats index.

Investing.com – BHP Billiton (NYSE:BBL) ADR traded 1.8% lower in Monday’s premarket on concerns that the company may not make the clean break with fossil fuels that many investors had hoped for.
BHP said overnight it's in talks with Woodside Petroleum (OTC:WOPEY) over a potential sale. One of the possibilities under consideration would include an all-share transaction in which BHP would distribute Woodside shares to its investors - an alternative that few BHP investors would prefer. 
Reports peg the value of the deal at $15 billion. Under the likely terms, Woodside will issue its own equity to BHP shareholders as consideration for buying the mining giant’s petroleum business.
Such a deal would leave BHP shareholders with shares of a pure fossil fuel player, shares that they would be forced to sell immediately due to their investment mandates. Shareholders are usually happier with a cash-deal that would help the company pay them dividends or fund a buyback program.
BHP has got rid of many of its polluting assets and the sale of the petroleum business would bring it close to an exit from all such sectors.
A report last week by a UN panel warned of dire consequences as it said the climate is getting warmer at a pace faster than estimated earlier.
For Woodside, an acquisition of BHP's oil and gas assets would roughly double its annual underlying earnings to around $8 billion. For BHP, a petroleum exit would strip out just 5% of underlying earnings, according to Reuters
Woodside share closed 4.5% lower in today’s trading.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) -HSBC Holdings has agreed to acquire French insurer Axa's Singapore assets for $575 million, part of its strategy of scaling up its wealth-management business in Asia to boost fee income.
HSBC said in a statement that the combined unit comprising HSBC Life Singapore and Axa Singapore would be the seventh-largest life insurer and the fourth-largest retail health insurer in Singapore, with over 600,000 policies in-force covering life, health and property and casualty insurance.
HSBC currently ranks 10th in life insurance in Singapore, and does not have a health insurance business.
The Asia-focused bank, like its peers, is battling poor returns from lending in a low interest rate environment and is looking to boost customer fee income in areas such as insurance and asset management.
It said in February it would invest $3.5 billion in its wealth and personal banking business in Asia, which includes its insurance operations, part of an overall investment in the region of $6 billion.
""This transaction gives the scale and the capability to continue to invest and grow from here,"" Bryce Johns, global CEO of HSBC Life and Insurance partnerships, told Reuters in an interview on Monday.
The deal is HSBC's largest acquisition since the $726 merger of its Oman branch with Oman International Bank in 2012, according to Dealogic.
AXA, which also is struggling with low interest rates, is streamlining its business and withdrawing from areas where it lacks scale.
HSBC will already be familiar with part of its new assets having sold AXA its general insurance business https://www.reuters.com/article/hsbc-insurance-idUSL4E8E71N220120307 in Singapore, as well as Hong Kong and Mexico, in 2012 - a time when the insurer was looking to bulk up in emerging markets and the bank wanted to cut costs. 
After exiting retail banking in the U.S. and France this year, HSBC Group Chief Executive Noel Quinn said last month the bank was looking at three or four ""bolt on"" acquisitions in Asia outside China in areas including insurance and asset management.
Singapore, one of Asia's biggest offshore wealth hubs, is also a regional base for thousands of global companies.
Last year, Singapore Life, an upstart insurer backed by investors including buyout group TPG and insurer Sumitomo Life, acquired the Singapore business of British insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV), as it expands in Southeast Asia.

Axa said the deal with HSBC was subject to regulatory approvals and would probably close by the fourth quarter. The Singapore unit had net assets of $474 million at the end of 2020, annualised new premiums of $85 million and gross written premiums of $739 million.
HSBC said Axa Singapore would provide it access to a sizeable tied-agency sales force, many leading independent financial advisory firms, and a large pool of insurance policyholders and corporate relationships.

20,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 04:31AM ET</span>",Analysis-Valuing China assets no easy task after $1 trillion wipeout,"By Tom Arnold and Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Any veteran investor will tell you that financial markets overshoot when trouble hits, but what if that market is the world's second-largest economy and the government has decided the rules of the game have changed? 
China's months-long regulatory crackdown https://www.reuters.com/world/china/education-bitcoin-chinas-season-regulatory-crackdown-2021-07-27 has included big names in e-commerce, the gig economy, exam cramming and most recently online insurance. Close to $1 trillion in market value has been wiped off China Inc since February.
For big firms that also list on markets like Wall Street because it brings in international investment, 2021 is already the worst year since the global financial crisis.
It could spring back of course, but there's the rub. Many analysts are convinced things will settle, but only the Beijing ruling elite know if and when that might be.
""Investors have been jolted,"" said Paul O'Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson. 
""This will weigh heavily on the outlook for profits, valuations and investor sentiment in China.""
But by how much?
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates MSCI China, which has seen one of its biggest lags on record versus world stocks this year, now trades at 13.9 times 12-month forward price-to-earnings, a 5% premium over MSCI's broader emerging market benchmark. 
That compares to about 17 times at the start of the year. It could get down to 13 times, says Morgan Stanley.
Analysts bullish on Chinese stocks heading into the tumult are now assessing the damage.
In March, before the latest crackdown, the average consensus 12 month share price target for stocks in the MSCI China Index, was about 40% higher than a year earlier.
The majority of analysts rate giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holdings and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) at least a ""buy"", according to Refinitiv data, while most recommend a ""hold"" or ""buy"" for New Oriental Education & Technology Group, whose stock has tumbled close to 90% this year.
""The process of earnings downgrades and ratings downgrades has barely started,"" said Janus Henderson's O'Connor.
Evergrande Property Services, part of China's most indebted property developer, has already lost more than half of its market capitalisation from the peak. The share price is currently trading around 13 times forward price-to-earnings multiples, significantly lower than peers. 
(Graphic: Chinese stocks see huge underperformance due to crackdowns https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbpgnrqlevq/Pasted%20image%201628785844187.png) 
PROBLEMS VS POSSIBILITIES 
Having pumped in more than $800 billion over the past five years, investors are not about to fold their bets that China will offer the biggest boost to global financial markets in the decades to come. 
And while they acknowledge the changes are part of a broader plan to make economic growth more inclusive in the long run, they are mindful that future returns will depend much more on careful assessment of risk.
""It's important to distinguish between what is really volatility or noise and what is here to stay,"" said Michael Bolliger, chief investment officer, emerging markets, at UBS Global Wealth Management.
While some damaged sectors are likely to bounce back over time, others, like tutoring, which the government now wants to be non profit making, almost certainly won't.
""They changed almost the DNA of these companies,"" said Bolliger. 
The hit has been painful. EPFR data shows around $2 billion was pulled out of equity funds with significant China exposure in the first week of this month alone. Morningstar figures point to China-focused funds nursing at least 7% negative returns. For context, they made around 13% on average for the past five years. 
(Graphic: Chinese stocks battered by clampdowns https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwmroyvo/Pasted%20image%201628786141182.png) 
BUST OR BOON?
It has not only been stocks that have suffered.
China's giant bond markets have been roiled by debt crises besetting firms such as Huarong and Evergrande, with the latter's problems coming as the government seeks to slash leverage in the property sector.
Here the moves point to rising distress. Chinese credit's Z-score, a measure of market volatility, reached 0.7 standard deviations above its 15-year mean last month, from 1.8 in January.
Typically, a score below 1.8 suggests looming bankruptcy.
""Will the government allow these property developers to default and have a big debt crisis? I find it very unlikely,"" said Gustavo Medeiros, Ashmore Group's deputy head of research.
Widening spread differentials have historically offered an attractive entry point, said Michele Barlow, SSGA's Asia-Pacific head of investment strategy and research. But there's still caution.
""Investors will have to change their style of investing from being focused on yields to one based on fundamental analysis,"" said Shamaila Khan, AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB)'s head of EM debt on the Global Markets Forum. 
And it may also put Chinese assets on a more sustainable footing, supporting earnings in the long-run.
Having been on the receiving end of China's tumble this year, Hans Peterson, global head of asset allocation at SEB Investment Management, is staying in and may add if Beijing and the central bank signal fresh stimulus.

""It is good to keep an eye on the possibilities in China, rather than the problems,"" he said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Didi Global Inc said on Monday it will provide its drivers in several Chinese cities with more details on the fees they receive, the first big move by the ride-hailing giant after state media accused it of paying drivers unfairly.
Didi said drivers in seven Chinese cities including Shenyang and Changchun will be the first to know details of how much they get and how much passengers pay for each ride through a new function it added to its app for drivers on Monday, it said in a Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) post. 
The company, which is backed by SoftBank,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), will continue to adjust its pricing strategy after receiving drivers' responses, it said. 
""There are still many shortcomings with this transparent income statement that was delivered late, we will continue to improve it and work hard to expand it to other cities,"" it said. 
In May, China's state news agency Xinhua said in an investigative report that Didi received more than 30% of what customers pay for a ride and criticised the policy that it described as unfair.

After the Xinhua report, Didi said in a post that drivers on average received 79.1% of passenger fees for rides last year and that 3.1% of fees went towards its profit.
Didi is being probed by several Chinese regulators over issues such as its handling of customer data. The company went ahead with its $4.4 billion New York initial public offering in June despite pushback from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Monday, as weak Chinese economic data pointed to a Covid-induced slowdown while geopolitical turmoil prompted caution.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.8%.
European markets tracked losses in Asia earlier Monday after data released in China earlier in the day showed industrial production rose 6.4% year-on-year in July, and retail sales grew 8.5% year-on-year in the same month, both lower than expected. 
This slowdown is the result of the second largest economy in the world, and a key growth driver, tightening mobility restrictions to combat the spread of the highly-transmissible delta variant of the Covid-19 virus.
In neighboring Japan, the GDP grew 0.3% quarter-on-quarter and 1.3% year-on-year in the second quarter, avoiding a double-dip recession despite continued restrictions to contain the coronavirus. 
The collapse of the Afghan government after Taliban insurgents took over Kabul, the capital, has added to the negative sentiment.
Back in Europe, there is little in the way of tier one economic data due for release Monday. 
In the corporate sector, HSBC (LON:HSBA) stock fell 0.5% after Europe’s largest bank by assets agreed to acquire AXA's (PA:AXAF) insurance assets in Singapore for $575 million as it beefs up its insurance and wealth business. AXA stock also fell 0.5%.
HSBC said the combined business would be the seventh-largest life insurer and the fourth-largest retail health insurer.
Sticking with the M&A theme, Bloomberg reported Monday that  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) is in advanced talks to acquire a stake of roughly 20%  in the oil refining and chemicals business of Reliance Industries for up to $25 billion.
Elsewhere, oil prices fell by over 1% Monday on concerns mobility restrictions in China, the second largest importer of crude in the world, will hit fuel demand.
China's daily crude throughput last month fell to the lowest since May 2020 as independent refiners slashed production, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. That was the first year-on-year decline since March last year when the coronavirus hit hard.

26,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>",Marketmind: A heavy dose of caution,"A look at the day ahead from Saikat Chatterjee.
China's disappointing monthly activity data suggests the world's No.2 economy is losing steam more quickly than anticipated and sets the scene for a cautious start to the week.
July retail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment were all weaker than expected as the latest COVID-19 outbreak weighs. Investors hoping for more stimulus may have to wait longer as Beijing policymakers want to allow July's reserve requirement ratio cut to take effect before taking further action.
Nevertheless, the weak data has stalled the upward march of global stocks and pulled Asian shares towards last month’s lows. European and U.S. stock futures suggest a cautious start to the week.
Add Friday's news of a shock slump in U.S consumer sentiment to the lowest since 2011 and bond markets are back on a tear.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are down 11 bps in the last two sessions as their prices rise, with geopolitical uncertainty after the collapse of the Afghan government supporting safe-haven assets.
While the weak U.S. sentiment readings wiped off a week’s gain for the dollar against its major rivals, positioning data suggests more upside for the greenback.
Long dollar bets have grown to their biggest since March 2020. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting due this week will likely provide more fodder for dollar bulls, especially if more policymakers signal a likely tapering soon.
That central banks are moving to exit emergency stimulus should be clear this week, with New Zealand expected to become the first major economy to lift interest rates.
Money markets have priced in a full quarter point rate hike on Wednesday and a 25% probability of a 50 bps hike. Norway’s central bank could also signal the timing of its own rate rise possibly in autumn.
Earnings season meanwhile winds down with some impressive readings: European shares are reporting a 150% year on year earnings growth and U.S. stocks indicate a 90% earnings growth.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:
- Auctions: US 6-mth and 3-mth T-bills, US data on foreign buying of Treasuries in June.
- HSBC to buy Axa's Singapore insurance assets for $575 million.

- U.K. home asking prices slip for first time this year - Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY).

27,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 02:41AM ET</span>",Afghanistan aviation authority advises transit aircraft to reroute,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) -The Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority (ACAA) said on Monday that Kabul airspace had been released to the military and that it advised transit aircraft to reroute, according to a notice to airmen on its website, hastening some airline route switches.
United Airlines, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic had already stopped using Afghanistan airspace after insurgents took control of the presidential palace in Kabul as U.S.-led forces departed and Western nations scrambled on Monday to evacuate their citizens.
ACAA said any transit through Kabul airspace would be uncontrolled and it had advised the surrounding flight information regions that control airspace.
Kabul's flight information region covers all of Afghanistan.
Flight tracking website FlightRadar24 said on its Twitter account that an Air India flight from Chicago to Delhi had changed course and exited Afghanistan's airspace shortly after entering, while a Terra Avia flight from Baku to Delhi was also changing course.
Airlines and governments have paid more attention to the risks of flying over conflict zones in recent years after two deadly incidents involving surface-to-air missiles. 
A Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board, and an Ukraine International Airlines jet was downed by Iran's military in 2020, killing all 176 passengers and crew.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in July imposed new flight restrictions over Afghanistan for U.S. airlines and other U.S. operators.
The FAA said flights operating below 26,000 feet were prohibited in the Kabul Flight Information Region, which largely covers Afghanistan, unless operating in and out of Hamid Karzai International Airport, citing the risk ""posed by extremist/militant activity.""
The restrictions do not apply to U.S. military operations.

Other countries, including Canada, Britain, Germany and France had also advised airlines to maintain an altitude of at least 25,000 feet over Afghanistan, according to website Safe Airspace, which tracks such warnings.
Commercial flights set to land in Afghanistan have also been affected by the chaos on the ground. Emirates has suspended flights to Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, until further notice, the airline said on its website.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Monday, as a string of weak Chinese economic data releases points to a Covid-induced slowdown at one of the globe’s key growth engines.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.5%.
European markets are set to suffer from the weak sentiment in Asia Monday after data released in China earlier in the day showed industrial production rose 6.4% year-on-year in July, and retail sales grew 8.5% year-on-year in the same month, both lower than expected. 
This slowdown is the result of the second largest economy in the world tightening mobility restrictions to combat the spread of the highly-transmissible delta variant of the Covid-19 virus.
In neighboring Japan, the GDP grew 0.3% quarter-on-quarter and 1.3% year-on-year in the second quarter, avoiding a double-dip recession despite continued restrictions to contain the coronavirus. 
Those restrictions are yet to have their desired effect. The Japanese Sankei newspaper reported Monday that Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is poised to expand and extend for about another two weeks a virus state of emergency in Tokyo.
The collapse of the Afghan government after Taliban insurgents took over Kabul, the capital, has added to the negative sentiment.
Back in Europe, there is little in the way of tier one economic data due for release Monday. 
In the corporate sector, HSBC (LON:HSBA) will likely be in the spotlight after Europe’s largest bank by assets agreed to acquire AXA's (PA:AXAF) insurance assets in Singapore for $575 million as it beefs up its insurance and wealth business.
HSBC said the combined business would be the seventh-largest life insurer and the fourth-largest retail health insurer.
Elsewhere, oil prices fell by over 1% Monday on concerns mobility restrictions in China, the second largest importer of crude in the world, will hit fuel demand.
China's daily crude throughput last month fell to the lowest since May 2020 as independent refiners slashed production, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. That was the first year-on-year decline since March last year when the coronavirus hit hard.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% lower at $67.27 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.3% to $69.66.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,773.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded marginally lower at 1.1789.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 01:31AM ET</span>",U.S. investors lean on blank-check firms in search for energy transition targets,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. oil investment bankers, portfolio managers and executives have formed over 20 listed blank-check companies to take renewable energy companies public, with more listings expected.
Investors are rushing to form these companies, known as Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), as capital shifts from traditional oil and gas investments to low-carbon alternatives. SPACs have been most active in the technology and healthcare industries, but the alternative energy space is heating up.
More than 412 SPAC IPOs raising $121 billion have taken place so far in 2021, up from 247 raising $83 billion total last year, said Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida specializing in IPOs. 
Healthcare, financial technology and autonomous vehicles continue to be heavily represented, but alternative energy is gaining traction, the data shows. 
""I would expect there would be more energy-related SPAC mergers,"" Ritter said. 
According to Reuters interviews with eight advisors, at least 10 companies are looking to launch additional renewable SPACs, beyond the 20 that have already publicly filed. 
By contrast, only about three exploration and production SPACs are currently publicly filed with the SEC and none have launched in about 18 months, a sharp contrast with 2016 when oil prices crashed, and investors used SPACs to buy companies in a turnaround bet.
SPACs are publicly traded vehicles that raise capital with the explicit purpose of acquiring a private existing business and taking it public, sidestepping the traditional initial public offering (IPO) process.
Many of the renewable SPACs that are currently publicly filed with the SEC have raised about $250 million or more. They are looking to buy privately-held companies that produce batteries for renewable energy storage, hydrogen storage solutions, carbon storage, and even some drilling for natural gas, a lower-carbon fossil fuel, according to SEC documents reviewed by Reuters. 
For example, Peridot Acquisition Corp, a renewable SPAC, closed on its acquisition of Li-Cycle, a lithium-ion battery recycler, on Aug. 10. Peridot has formed a second SPAC aimed at acquiring additional renewable companies. 
Other SPACs, such as GoGreen Investments Corp, are nearing deals with targets, the advisors said, speaking on a condition of anonymity as the talks are not public. 
Alternative energy SPACs that have publicly formed have come together under increasing pressure from investors who want to shift into renewables.
“Their limited partners are telling them that they don’t want them to look into traditional energy,” said Mike Blankenship, a partner in the Houston office of law firm Winston & Strawn. ""They are creating SPACs to get a percentage of these companies and then a board seat in these companies."" 
John Dowd, a former top energy portfolio manager for Fidelity, serves as chief executive for GoGreen Investment, a proposed $250 million SPAC that filed its S-1 this summer, with plans to target a wide variety of ""energy transition"" companies from hydrogen storage to software solutions. 
Leadership and boards of the new renewable SPACs often include executives, bankers and portfolio managers who previously specialized in oil, gas and conventional utilities, according to SEC filings. 
Beyond Peridot, a handful of renewable SPACs have already taken their targets public, including Chargepoint. Bill Gates-backed Heliogen Inc https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bill-gates-backed-heliogen-go-public-through-2-bln-spac-deal-2021-07-07 plans to go public through a $2 billion SPAC deal with Athena Technology Acquisition Corp.
However, few privately-held renewable companies are large enough to be ideal targets for SPACs, said Blankenship. Generally, companies need to be valued at over $1 billion to attract attention for a $250 million SPAC, Ritter said. 

Because the industry is changing so rapidly, there are many start-ups that are not obvious targets, Blankenship said. 
SPACs are also facing additional regulatory scrutiny. Last month, Reuters reported that U.S. securities regulators ramped up its inquiry on Wall Street's SPAC frenzy, homing in on potential conflicts of interest and deal structures that may spur underwriters to create unsuitable deals.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Expectations are growing that BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) Ltd will deliver a verdict on the future of its petroleum business at its results next week, as it comes under increasing pressure to cut its fossil fuel footprint.
The world's biggest miner has been facing calls to detail how and when it will exit fossil fuels, with activist investor Market Forces filing a resolution on the topic this week for annual meetings in October and November.
BHP's decision this month to approve $802 million in development spending on oil projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico - just days before a new report that issued dire warnings about human contribution to climate change - has only ratcheted up pressure from some investors.
""It's clear something is brewing,"" said Simon Mawhinney, Chief Investment Officer at Allan Gray Australia.
BHP declined to comment on market speculation.
Analysts value BHP's petroleum business, made up of assets in Australia, the Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago and Algeria, at $10 billion to $17 billion. The division contributed 5% of BHP's underlying earnings of $14.7 billion in the first half to end-December, compared with 70% for iron ore.
Investors are split on their fit within BHP's portfolio, especially as the company focuses on new economy materials such as copper, nickel and potash.
An exit from petroleum would constitute ""a major shift"" in BHP's environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials and overall strategy towards fossil fuels,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rahul Anand said in a recent note.
AUSTRALIA AND THE REST
BHP's late-life, mainly low-return energy assets in Australia are seen as particularly ripe for a sale amid high oil and gas prices.
""For BHP, if you look at its Australian (energy) assets, if they could exit those in a meaningful way for something approximating value, that would be a good outcome,"" said Brenton Saunders, a portfolio manager with shareholder Pendal Group.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Citi value the Australian energy assets - including the Bass Strait, Northwest Shelf LNG and the Scarborough gas field - at $3 billion to $5 billion.
Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum Ltd is seen as the most logical buyer as they would boost its free cash flow and increase its stakes in key projects, although not all investors favour such a tie-up given the asset mix and likely need for an equity raising.
Woodside declined to comment.
BHP would also have to take a discount on any sale given some heavy decommissioning liabilities, said Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic, although a sale could boost its ESG rating and attract new shareholders.
""BHP could sell these for discounts but still increase share value though a re-rating on the rest of their business,"" he said.
Elsewhere, investors say BHP's petroleum assets are more attractive.
The most valuable are its stakes in oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico, valued at $10.4 billion by Wood Mackenzie, which made up about 25% of the company's 103 million barrels of oil equivalent output the year to June 2021.

""The rest of the portfolio, there are parts that are high growth, high returning. They've done a lot of work on them and shareholders have had to wear some of the bad times. They are good assets,"" said Pendal Group's Saunders.
BHP is due to deliver its annual results on Tuesday at 0700 GMT.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2021 09:05AM ET</span>",Investors give value stocks a second look as bond yields rally,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. value stocks may be getting a second wind, as bets on economic strength bolster Treasury yields and lift cyclically-sensitive shares that have stagnated in recent months after a powerful rally earlier this year.
The S&P 500 value stock index, which is relatively heavily weighted in shares of financials, energy firms and other economically sensitive companies, is up 5.5% from last month's lows, outperforming its tech-heavy counterpart by more than a percentage point in a rally that accelerated over the past week. The value index is up 18% this year, despite stalling after a strong start to 2021.
The move may herald a nascent comeback for the so-called reflation trade, a bet on rebounding economic growth that saw value stocks surge starting late last year alongside Treasury yields. Yields have climbed this time around as well, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury, which moves inversely to prices, up about 20 basis points since last week, to 1.36%, before pulling back on Friday.
“I do think value is somewhat of a coiled spring,” said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors, who believes value could outperform for at least the next six months. “I do think it has another run left in it.”
Investors pointed to several reasons for value's rosier outlook. While the rise in coronavirus cases spurred by the Delta variant, remains a wildcard, signs that infections may be slowing in Europe and parts of the United States could mean that the lockdowns required last year will not be needed for the foreseeable future, Peron said.
At the same time, some investors believe growth will remain strong in the U.S. even after peaking in the second quarter. U.S. gross domestic product is expected to rise 6.1% in 2021, and 4.8% in 2022, according to Oxford Economics, stronger than what annual growth has been for the past decade. 
""We haven’t seen growth rates this high in some time and that’s why we think ... value can keep outperforming, even once the rate of growth peaks,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
Among those calling for more gains in value stocks are technical strategists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), who in the past week said the S&P 500 value index ""looks poised for a breakout."" Truist Advisory Services on Wednesday said it expects more upside for value over the next 12 months given the still strong economic outlook and weak earnings trends for tech compared to the broader market.
Since the 10-year yield made a recent bottom last week, the S&P 500 value index has climbed 2.4% against a 0.5% rise for its growth counterpart.
The value stock bounce comes as investors digest data from the past week showing a potential peak in inflation, while looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium at the end of the month. That event, or the central bank's next policy meeting in September, could offer signals on when it will begin unwinding the $120 billion a month government bond buying program that has helped support asset prices.
Next week, the monthly U.S. retail sales report and earnings from retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) could shed more light on the health of the consumer.
Investors are also keeping a close eye on Treasury yields, with rising yields often viewed as a sign of economic optimism that could also boost value stocks. Higher yields also particularly benefit profit margins of banks, which tend to make up large portions of value indexes. 
Plenty of stumbling blocks remain for the value trade. Signs that the coronavirus is threatening the economic outlook could send investors back toward large technology and growth shares that performed well for much of 2020. Data on Friday showing that consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in a decade weighed on yields.

SpaceX in May successfully landed its Starship prototype, SN15, a reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle that could eventually carry astronauts and large cargo payloads to the moon and Mars. 
The touchdown came after four prototype landing attempts had ended in explosions.
""First orbital stack of Starship should be ready for flight in a few weeks, pending only regulatory approval,"" Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1426715232475533319.
The complete Starship rocket, SpaceX's next-generation launch vehicle, stands 394 feet (120 meters) tall when coupled with its super-heavy first-stage booster. 

It is at the center of the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO's ambitions to make human space travel more affordable and routine.
An orbital Starship flight is planned for year's end, and Musk has said he intends to fly Japanese billionaire entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa around the moon in the Starship in 2023.

The investigation is still ongoing, the police bureau of eastern China’s Jinan city, where the incident occurred, said in a statement via Weibo (NASDAQ:WB).
The police update came after a female employee went public with an 11-page account on Alibaba's intranet saying her manager and a client sexually assaulted her during a business trip, and that superiors and human resources did not take her report seriously.
The scandal led to fierce public backlash against Alibaba, which later fired the male employee. 
The male Alibaba employee, whom police only identify by his surname Wang, entered the hotel room of the victim, surnamed Zhou, four times while she was drunk after a business dinner on July 27 and committed “forcible indecency” during one of these visits, according to the police statement.
The client had also committed the act against Zhou on two occasions during the trip, they said. 

The police said that they had not found enough evidence that Zhou was forced to drink alcohol during a banquet that evening attended by the suspects, as she had claimed. 
Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters was unable to reach the two suspects or Zhou for comment.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's commerce minister faced heat on social media on Saturday for his remarks that many big domestic businesses had overlooked national interests and that $106 billion Tata Group's objections to proposed policy changes for e-commerce had upset him.
At an event organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Thursday, Minister Piyush Goyal criticised Tata and more broadly said local businesses should not just focus on profits or think of bypassing local laws, according to media reports and a source who attended the event.
The comments caught public attention and stoked a debate on social media after The Hindu newspaper reported on Saturday the government had asked the CII to block videos with Goyal's comments. 
Two links to those videos on Goyal's speech shared with journalists were now marked private and blocked. The CII and Goyal's office did not respond to a request for comment. 
""The kind of language used against industry captains & calling their work against nation's interest is shameful ... CII should demand an apology instead of helping him by pulling down the video,"" said Priyanka Chaturvedi, a lawmaker and opposition leader.
A spokeswoman of India's main opposition Congress Party, Supriya Shrinate, said on Twitter Goyal's remarks were ""undignified"".
Goyal's comments on Tata came after Reuters last month reported https://reut.rs/3eLCfJo the conglomerate was among most vociferous in telling the government in a July meeting that proposed e-commerce rules will have a major impact on its business https://reut.rs/3dDlJdI and bar its joint venture partners like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) from selling goods on Tata's shopping websites.
At the CII event, Goyal said Tata's objection to the rules had hurt him, saying he had conveyed that position to Tata Sons Chairman N. Chandrasekaran, the source who attended said.
Tata declined to comment on Saturday.
Goyal has also repeatedly criticized https://reut.rs/3qs5aXw Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Flipkart for allegedly bypassing foreign investment rules for e-commerce. This week, he also invoked the ""Quit India"" movement https://reut.rs/3AwPsho in parliament as he welcomed a court order that allowed an antitrust probe of the two companies to continue.

The Confederation of All India Traders, however, welcomed Goyal's stand on Saturday, saying it was ""highly unfortunate"" that Tata was opposing government's e-commerce rules.
The 153-year-old Tata Group has big e-commerce plans and is planning launch of an app that will integrate several of its top brands, but the proposed policy changes have spooked it, Reuters has reported https://reut.rs/3eLCfJo.

China launched the tech-focused STAR Market in Shanghai in mid-2019, along with the introduction of a U.S.-style, registration-based initial public offering (IPO) system in that market. 
The Securities Association of China (SAC) said late on Friday that a joint probe recently with the Shanghai Stock Exchange over STAR IPOs had exposed issues with 19 institutional investors. 
The problems included weak internal controls, inadequate rationale for price-settings, non-compliance with stipulated procedures and improper storage of working papers, the SAC said in a statement, without identifying the companies.
One insurer has been temporarily banned from participating in the institutional portion of IPO subscriptions, while eight fund houses and one asset manager have been barred from the share placement market for a month, according to the statement.

SAC said regulators will strengthen supervision and step up penalties against misbehaviour to maintain order for IPO price-setting and protect investors. 
China has already replicated the registration-based IPO system to Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext, and aims to gradually roll out the mechanism to the rest of China's stock market, which still uses a system based on regulators' approvals.

44,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2021 02:46AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors give value stocks a second look as bond yields rally,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. value stocks may be getting a second wind, as bets on economic strength bolster Treasury yields and lift cyclically-sensitive shares that have stagnated in recent months after a powerful rally earlier this year.
The S&P 500 value stock index, which is relatively heavily weighted in shares of financials, energy firms and other economically sensitive companies, is up 5.5% from last month's lows, outperforming its tech-heavy counterpart by more than a percentage point in a rally that accelerated over the past week. The value index is up 18% this year, despite stalling after a strong start to 2021.
The move may herald a nascent comeback for the so-called reflation trade, a bet on rebounding economic growth that saw value stocks surge starting late last year alongside Treasury yields. Yields have climbed this time around as well, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury, which moves inversely to prices, up about 20 basis points since last week, to 1.36%, before pulling back on Friday.
“I do think value is somewhat of a coiled spring,” said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors, who believes value could outperform for at least the next six months. “I do think it has another run left in it.”
Investors pointed to several reasons for value's rosier outlook. While the rise in coronavirus cases spurred by the Delta variant, remains a wildcard, signs that infections may be slowing in Europe and parts of the United States could mean that the lockdowns required last year will not be needed for the foreseeable future, Peron said.
At the same time, some investors believe growth will remain strong in the U.S. even after peaking in the second quarter. U.S. gross domestic product is expected to rise 6.1% in 2021, and 4.8% in 2022, according to Oxford Economics, stronger than what annual growth has been for the past decade. 
""We haven’t seen growth rates this high in some time and that’s why we think ... value can keep outperforming, even once the rate of growth peaks,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
Among those calling for more gains in value stocks are technical strategists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), who in the past week said the S&P 500 value index ""looks poised for a breakout."" Truist Advisory Services on Wednesday said it expects more upside for value over the next 12 months given the still strong economic outlook and weak earnings trends for tech compared to the broader market.
Since the 10-year yield made a recent bottom last week, the S&P 500 value index has climbed 2.4% against a 0.5% rise for its growth counterpart.
The value stock bounce comes as investors digest data from the past week showing a potential peak in inflation, while looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium at the end of the month. That event, or the central bank's next policy meeting in September, could offer signals on when it will begin unwinding the $120 billion a month government bond buying program that has helped support asset prices.
Next week, the monthly U.S. retail sales report and earnings from retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) could shed more light on the health of the consumer.
Investors are also keeping a close eye on Treasury yields, with rising yields often viewed as a sign of economic optimism that could also boost value stocks. Higher yields also particularly benefit profit margins of banks, which tend to make up large portions of value indexes. 
Plenty of stumbling blocks remain for the value trade. Signs that the coronavirus is threatening the economic outlook could send investors back toward large technology and growth shares that performed well for much of 2020. Data on Friday showing that consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in a decade weighed on yields.
Treasury yields have also experienced several sharp swings this year, wrongfooting investors. Yields on the 10-year fell to about 1.13% as recently as Aug. 4 -- some 65 basis points below the year's highs.

Many investors may also be reluctant to overly reduce positions in growth stocks, which dominated for much of the decade following the 2007-2009 financial crisis while value shares languished.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said late on Friday it will ask the U.S. Patent Office to rescind trademarks obtained by rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) for the terms ""Cruise"" and ""Super Cruise,"" escalating a brawl GM began by suing Ford over its use of ""Blue Cruise"" for an automated driving system.
The legal fight between the two Detroit automakers turns on whether ""cruise"" is a generic term for technology that allows the car to take over some share of driving tasks from a human motorist. 
The clash underscores the intensity of competition among established automakers to be seen as leaders in automated driving technology, competitive with Silicon Valley rivals Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc 's Waymo unit and others.
GM filed a federal suit against Ford on July 24, accusing Ford of violating GM trademarks by using the name ""Blue Cruise"" for a system that enables hands-free driving. 
GM had previously trademarked ""Super Cruise"" for its hands-free, partially automated driving technology. It also has trademarked ""Cruise,"" the name of its robo-taxi unit in San Francisco.
Ford reiterated on Friday its position that GM's suit is frivolous. The effort to nullify GM's trademarks for the use of the word ""cruise"" takes the fight to a new level.
""To defend itself, Ford has no choice but to ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to rescind both of GM’s “Cruise” and “Super Cruise” trademark registrations that should have never been registered in the first place,"" Ford said. ""Any number of companies use the word 'cruise' in connection with driver assist technology.""

Among the examples Ford cited: ""Predictive Cruise,"" marketed by Mack Trucks; ""Smart Cruise Control"" marketed by Hyundai Motor Co, and Autocruise, used by auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG.
GM said Friday that Super Cruise ""has had a well established commercial presence since 2017,"" and added in a statement that the company ""remains committed to vigorously defending our brands and protecting the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market and that won’t change.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow Industrial and S&P 500 edged up to closing records on Friday and notched a second straight week of gains, buoyed by a climb in Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) shares, but a sharp drop in consumer sentiment kept gains in check. 
Walt Disney rose 1.00% as one of the biggest boosts to both the Dow and benchmark S&P index after its profit topped market expectations as its streaming services added more customers than expected and its pandemic-hit U.S. theme parks returned to profitability.
But a report from the University of Michigan dented optimism after it showed the university's preliminary consumer sentiment index fell to 70.2, its lowest level in a decade, suggesting that the Delta variant of the coronavirus was impacting consumers.
""That is concerning, the consumer is by all accounts in an extremely strong position but there is this kind of COVID fatigue that is really starting to wear on people’s sentiment,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. 
""Regardless of lockdown or full reopen, the consumer is healthy enough to spend and kind of keep the economy afloat, it will be different names and different sectors that become the beneficiaries of it."" 
The report sent the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note lower and in turn helped lift mega-cap growth names, such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), up 1.05%, while online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) slipped 0.29%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15.53 points, or 0.04%, to 35,515.38, the S&P 500 gained 7.17 points, or 0.16%, to 4,468 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.64 points, or 0.04%, to 14,822.90.
For the week, the Dow gained 0.87%, the S&P 500 advanced 0.71% and the Nasdaq slipped 0.09%. 
U.S. stocks have managed to slowly grind to new highs over the past few sessions as investor confidence in economic recovery was bolstered by a strong earnings season, the passage of a large infrastructure bill and data showing inflation may be increasing at a slower pace than feared.
In the wake of new data from earlier this week that showed consumer price increases slowed in July, while producer prices posted their biggest annual rise in more than a decade, investors are now looking ahead to the meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this month for cues on policy. 
In recent days, several Fed officials said it is nearly time for the central bank to begin pulling back on its monetary support, including the tapering of its asset purchases. 
DoorDash Inc rose 3.50% in choppy trading after the food-delivery firm's loss widened more than expected in the second quarter.
Airbnb Inc gained 1.07% as it recovered from earlier declines, after it flagged a hit to its current-quarter bookings by the Delta variant and a slowing pace of U.S. vaccination.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.99 billion shares, compared with the 9.42 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
The S&P 500 posted 60 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 87 new highs and 159 new lows.

The resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States due to the Delta variant and the new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that requires fully vaccinated individuals to wear masks have led companies to change their plans on return to office, vaccinations and masking.

The technology firm also asked its employees to get fully vaccinated, joining other big techs to fight the spread of the virus.

(Reuters) - After a week of criticism over a its planned new system for detecting images of child sex abuse, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Friday that it will hunt only for pictures that have been flagged by clearinghouses in multiple countries.
That shift and others intended to reassure privacy advocates were detailed to reporters in an unprecedented fourth background briefing since the initial announcement eight days prior of a plan to monitor customer devices.
After previously declining to say how many matched images on a phone or computer it would take before the operating system notifies Apple for a human review and possible reporting to authorities, executives said on Friday it would start with 30, though the number could become lower over time as the system improves.
Apple also said it would be easy for researchers to make sure that the list of image identifiers being sought on one iPhone was the same as the lists on all other phones, seeking to blunt concerns that the new mechanism could be used to target individuals. The company published a long paper explaining how it had reasoned through potential attacks on the system and defended against them. 
Apple acknowledged that it had handled communications around the program poorly, triggering backlash from influential technology policy groups and even its own employees concerned that the company was jeopardizing its reputation for protecting consumer privacy. 
It declined to say whether that criticism had changed any of the policies or software, but said that the project was still in development and changes were to be expected.
Asked why it had only announced that the U.S.-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children would be a supplier of flagged image identifiers when at least one other clearinghouse would need to have separately flagged the same picture, an Apple executive said that the company had only finalized its deal with NCMEC.
The rolling series of explanations, each giving more details that make the plan seem less hostile to privacy, convinced some of the company's critics that their voices were forcing real change.
""Our pushing is having an effect,"" tweeted Riana Pfefferkorn, an encryption and surveillance researcher at Stanford University.
Apple said last week that it will check photos if they are about to be stored on the iCloud online service, adding later that it would begin with just the United States.

Other technology companies perform similar checks once photos are uploaded to their servers. Apple's decision to put key aspects of the system on the phone itself prompted concerns that governments could force Apple to expand the system for other uses, such as scanning for prohibited political imagery.
The controversy has even moved into Apple's ranks, with employees debating the move in hundreds of posts on an internal chat channel, Reuters reported this week.

So, let’s find out if it’s worth emulating the legendary investor.Known as the “Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha,” Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors ever, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) (BRK.A) recovered all of its pandemic-driven losses in the second quarter of 2021 to hit a record high. BRK.A’s operating income rose 21% year-over-year to $6.69 billion in the second quarter, while its equity investments rose 6.8% from the prior-year quarter to $28 billion.

Buffett has a substantial stake in the pharmaceutical industry. He invested billions of dollars in big pharma stocks last year. The shares of pharma companies rallied powerfully last year on increased demand for therapeutic drugs, supplements, and other remedial needs for COVID-19.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Dow eked out a fourth-straight day of record closes, supported by mostly positive quarterly reports from corporates, though optimism was hurt by data showing the Delta variant is weighing on consumer sentiment. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week at a closing record of 35,515.38, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%, to clinch another closing record of 4,468. The Nasdaq closed flat.
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index slumped to a reading of 70.2 in the preliminary August survey from 81.2 in July, the weakest reading since December 2011.
The fall in consumer optimism over the economy comes as the Delta variant has scaled back expectations about a return to normal.
""There is little doubt that the pandemic’s resurgence due to the Delta variant has been met with a mixture of reason and emotion,"" according to the University of Michigan. ""The surge in negative economic assessments […] reflects an emotional response, mainly from dashed hopes that the pandemic would soon end.""
 Economists agree, and believe that consumers are weighing up the realization that the end of the pandemic still has a way to go.  
""The promise of vaccines and a return to something at least resembling pre-COVID ""normal"" has shifted towards concerns that fear of being sick, masks, social distancing, virtual/distance learning, work from home, an endless stream of booster shots and seeing relatives through glass will instead be the norm going forward,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Signs the consumer, which makes up two-thirds of the economy, is growing wary of the economy, sent U.S. Treasury yields sharply lower, and weighed on financials as banking stocks slipped.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were down more than 1%. 
Still, the broader market was supported by rising tech stocks and better-than-expected quarterly results from corporates including  Disney  .
Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) reported Thursday third-quarter results that beat analysts' forecasts, led by better-than-expected Disney+ streaming performance and a return to profit in its theme parks and resorts business.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global stock markets hit new record highs on Friday, boosted by forecast-beating corporate earnings, but the dollar and Treasury yields fell after data showed U.S. consumer confidence plummeted in early August.
The University of Michigan's survey showed consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since 2011 in the first half of this month. The decline marked one of the six largest drops in the past 50 years of the survey.
The unexpectedly weak reading could give Federal Reserve policymakers reason to pause on a decision over whether to begin 
pulling back the extraordinary stimulus it put in place to shield the U.S. economy from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""The renewed plunge suggests the latest wave of virus cases driven by the Delta variant could be a bigger drag on the economy than we had thought,"" said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics.
Pandemic-era stimulus has been behind much of the surge in stock prices the past year, but massive corporate earnings have given the rally new legs in recent weeks. 
""If we look at the earnings trajectory, it still lends a lot of support to the valuations in the market,"" said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management. ""Earnings season provided some comfort and stability.""

European stocks scaled new highs and clocked their fourth consecutive week of gains on optimism over a strong earnings season and steady recovery from the pandemic-led economic downturn. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.2% to a record high of 476.16, for the tenth straight session. The index has now matched its best winning streak since December 2006.

Investing.com – The Dow eased from record highs Friday, as investors weighed up mostly positive quarterly reports from corporates, and signs that the Delta variant is weighing on the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, easing from its intraday record of 35,610.57, while the S&P 500 rose 0.1%, and was close to its all-time intraday high of 4,467.94, and the Nasdaq was down 0.1%.
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index slumped to a reading of 70.2 in the preliminary August survey from 81.2 in July, the weakest reading since December 2011.
The fall in consumer optimism over the economy comes as the Delta variant has scaled back expectations about a return to normal.
""There is little doubt that the pandemic’s resurgence due to the Delta variant has been met with a mixture of reason and emotion,"" according to the University of Michigan. ""The surge in negative economic assessments […] reflects an emotional response, mainly from dashed hopes that the pandemic would soon end.""
 Economists agree, and believe that consumers are weighing up the realization that the end of the pandemic still has a way to go.  
""The promise of vaccines and a return to something at least resembling pre-COVID ""normal"" has shifted towards concerns that fear of being sick, masks, social distancing, virtual/distance learning, work from home, an endless stream of booster shots and seeing relatives through glass will instead be the norm going forward,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Signs the consumer, which makes up two-thirds of the economy, is growing wary of the economy, sent U.S. Treasury yields sharply lower, and weighed on financials as banking stocks slipped.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were down more than 1%. 
Still, the broader market was supported by rising tech stocks and better-than-expected quarterly results from corporates including  Disney  .
Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) reported Thursday third-quarter results that beat analysts' forecasts, led by better-than-expected Disney+ performance and a return to profit in its theme parks and resorts business.

Amazon began rolling out biometric technology at its Whole Foods stores around Seattle in April, letting shoppers pay for items with a scan of their palm. The system, called Amazon One, lets customers link a credit card to their palm print. 
Klobuchar, who was joined by Senators Bill Cassidy, a Republican, and Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, expressed concern in the letter dated Thursday about both privacy and competition related to Amazon One.
""Our concerns about user privacy are heightened by evidence that Amazon shared voice data with third-party contractors and allegations that Amazon has violated biometric privacy laws,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter.
""We are also concerned that Amazon may use data from Amazon One, including data from third-party customers that may purchase and use Amazon One devices, to further cement its competitive power and suppress competition across various markets,"" they wrote. 
The lawmakers asked Amazon about plans to expand Amazon One, and to whom they had sold or licensed the technology. They also asked how many people had signed up for it, how the data is used and if it is ever paired with facial recognition systems. 
Amazon declined comment but pointed to a blog post dated April 21, which said that it was in ""active discussions with several potential customers.""

It further said that Amazon One was designed to be ""highly secure.""
""The Amazon One device is protected by multiple security controls, and palm images are never stored on the Amazon One device. Rather, the images are encrypted and sent to a highly secure area we custom-built for Amazon One in the cloud,"" the blog post said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazilian planemaker  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ) posted its first quarterly recurring profit in more than three years on Friday and took another step toward the development of the first brand-new Western turboprop aircraft in decades.
Turboprops are said to be more efficient on shorter trips and are particularly attractive at a time of higher oil prices.
Embraer's new concept for the turboprop would feature engines mounted at the rear of the aircraft, an unusual change from the more conventional wing-mounted engines, the company's chief commercial officer, Arjan Meijer, said on Twitter. 
The company has been searching for a partner to develop a new turboprop that would compete with European manufacturer ATR, which dominates the market with a long-established model of roughly 50 to 70 seats. 
Embraer had previously sought to develop its turboprop under a partnership with Boeing (NYSE:BA) that fell through early in the coronavirus pandemic.
Meijer did not say who would supply the aircraft's engines. Pratt and Whitney currently supplies all turboprop engines, but GE Aviation is developing a competing model.
Embraer reported second-quarter net income of 212.8 million reais ($40.5 million), its first recurring profit since the first quarter of 2018, driven by a partial recovery in travel.
A year earlier it posted a loss of 1.071 billion reais and was scrambling to restructure operations to contend with the pandemic and the failed $4 billion deal with  Boeing Co .
The second quarter of last year was particularly brutal for planemakers, and the vast majority of Embraer's commercial aircraft revenue vanished as airlines deferred orders. 
But on Friday Embraer suggested it may be turning the page. 
Chief Financial Officer Antonio Carlos Garcia said on a call with analysts that Embraer is poised to post a stronger performance next year, and he is ""very optimistic"" about finding a partner for the turboprop. 
Embraer, which had suspended guidance for its operations when the pandemic began, said it sees commercial deliveries at between 45 and 50 planes and executive aviation deliveries at 90 to 95.

Revenue, which more than doubled in the second quarter to $5.922 billion, is likely to be between $4 billion and $4.5 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.5% to 9.5%. Free cash flow should be at breakeven, with a cash burn of up to $150 million seen this year.

Let’s discuss.Last week, President Biden signed an executive order setting a target for zero-emissions vehicles to represent at least half of all cars sold in the United States by 2030. The executive order is aligned with the country’s goal of phasing out internal combustion vehicles by 2050.
Rising concerns about climate change, government incentives, and the long-term cost-saving benefits of electric vehicles (EVs) should propel the industry’s growth. As a result, the EV battery market is expected to grow significantly. According to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global EV battery market is projected to grow at a 6.6% CAGR over the next six years to $82.20 billion by 2027. Given this backdrop, fundamentally sound EV battery stocks Panasonic Corporation (PCRFY) and EnerSys (ENS) should witness substantial growth.
However, production and supply bottlenecks have caused some companies in this space to suffer declining financials.

(Reuters) - The U.S. agency that regulates workplace safety issued guidance on Friday urging employers to require many fully vaccinated workers to wear masks to protect unvaccinated colleagues and customers, amid a surge in COVID-19 cases. 
    The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommended that workers wear masks ""in areas of substantial or high community transmission,"" such as manufacturing plants, meat processing facilities and retail establishments, unless they have medical conditions that make it difficult to wear a face covering.
    Employers should also consider staggering the times workers clock in and out of work and take breaks to prevent large groups of people from congregating, OSHA said. High-volume retail businesses should ask customers to wear masks and consider requiring them. The agency had made similar recommendations last year, early on in the pandemic.
    The updated guidance comes as COVID-19 cases are on the rise across the U.S., particularly in areas where large numbers of people remain unvaccinated. Some preliminary studies have shown that vaccinated people are still capable of spreading the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. 
    An increasing number of employers have said they will require at least a part of their U.S. workforce to be vaccinated. Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Uber (NYSE:UBER), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and DoorDash have adopted mandates for corporate employees, and many airlines and technology companies are requiring employees to be vaccinated.

    Thursday's guidance, which is not legally binding, was issued after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late last month recommended that fully vaccinated individuals resume wearing face masks in public. 
    OSHA on Friday also said an emergency rule it adopted in June requiring healthcare employers to mandate use of face masks, ensure proper ventilation and limit the number of patients and visitors is ""more important than ever"" and will remain in place for the time being. The agency said it would revisit the requirements next month.

70,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>","Private Medicare plans must return overpayments, appeals court rules","By Brendan Pierson
(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday revived a rule requiring private insurers that administer federally funded Medicare plans to return potentially billions of dollars in overpayments they receive based on incorrect diagnoses.
The unanimous ruling by a panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington was a setback for UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH), which had successfully challenged the rule in a lower court.
UnitedHealth did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors and certain people with disabilities.
The 2014 rule applies to so-called Medicare Advantage insurance plans, which are funded through HHS but administered by private insurers like UnitedHealth.
HHS pays Medicare Advantage plans a base amount per beneficiary, adjusted according to diagnostic codes reflecting each beneficiary's individual risk factors.
Under the rule, if a Medicare Advantage insurer learns that it received a payment based on an unsupported diagnosis, it must return that payment within 60 days.
According to a 2016 federal audit, the government paid out about $16.2 billion that year based on unsupported diagnoses, nearly 10% of the total paid to Medicare Advantage insurers.
In its 2016 lawsuit, UnitedHealth argued that the overpayment rule treated Medicare Advantage differently from traditional Medicare, which pays providers on a fee-for-service basis and does not comprehensively audit claims for overpayments. The insurer said the difference ran afoul of the Medicare law's requirement of ""actuarial equivalence"" between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare.

In 2018, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer in Washington agreed, overturning the rule.
Circuit Judge Cornelia Pillard, however, wrote for the appeals court panel Friday that there was ""no basis"" to conclude that Congress intended the actuarial equivalence requirement to ""thwart"" insurers' obligation to return overpayments.

Read on.Fifth generation (5G)network providers are poised to benefit significantly in the coming months because the U.S. Senate has approved a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan. The plan includes a $65 billion budget for broadband internet infrastructure, which is projected to accelerate 5G spectrum rollout across the U.S.
The Biden administration’s plans to provide access to high-speed internet at affordable prices in areas with no broadband infrastructure and to support the work-and-study-online trend should bolster the demand for 5G service providers. In addition, rising demand for machine-to-machine and IoT networks, mobile broadband services, and data breach concerns are anticipated to propel the growth of 5G infrastructure. The global 5G infrastructure market is expected to reach $80.5 billion by 2028, growing at a 49.8% CAGR.
Given this backdrop, we believe the prices of 5G stocks Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI), Nokia Corporation (NOK), and  Skyworks Solutions Inc . (SWKS) will likely gain significantly in the near term and, hence, could be solid bets now.

However, since overpriced tech stocks are now more prone to a correction because investors remain concerned about inflationary pressures, low-priced tech stocks Absolute Software (ABST) and AstroNova (ALOT) could be safe bets now. Trading at less than $20, we think these two stocks have the potential to generate substantial returns in the near term. Read on.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5% over the last four trading days on investors’ concerns about strong inflationary pressures. However, strong corporate earnings reported by the tech companies rekindled investor interest in the technology industry. This is evidenced by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 17.4% returns over the past three months.
Furthermore, rapid digitalization is increasing the demand for advanced technology solutions. And the continued deployment of 5G is expected to boost the industry's growth. The resurgence of COVID-19 cases has also made the backdrop favorable for the technology industry because it suggests a prolonging of remote activities adopted during the worst of the pandemic. .
But because investors expect a market correction in the near term, several overpriced tech stocks could suffer a decline. So, we think it could be wise to bet on affordably priced tech stocks. Absolute Software Corporation (ABST) and AstroNova Inc. (ALOT), which are currently trading below $20. fit the bill because they possess sufficient fundamental strength to create significant value for investors in the coming months.

73,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2021 01:27PM ET</span>",Dealmaking Surge Shrinks Ranks of Poultry-Only U.S. Meatpackers,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors looking for a ways to profit from the surging American chicken industry will soon have fewer options.
Deals announced this week for Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. and  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) Inc., respectively the second- and third-biggest U.S. poultry producers, would result in each being rolled into a bigger company.
The moves would absorb the last “pure play” U.S. chicken producers and come as the poultry market has been boosted by soaring sales of the meat at grocery stores and chicken sandwiches at restaurants. The acquisitions may also mean less transparency in the poultry market that has been beset by price-fixing allegations, a lack of labor and grueling working conditions inside meat plants.
There’s no chicken futures contract like there are markets in Chicago for cattle and hogs, so investors wanting to bet on chicken traditionally could turn to shares for Pilgrim’s Pride and Sanderson Farms. Each company had dedicated quarterly earnings calls where executives as of late discussed how severe winter weather killed birds and how chicken-genetics issues were slowing the rate of egg hatching.
Pilgrim’s shares jumped as much as 22% Friday, on pace for the biggest gains in eight years, after  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) said it planned to acquire all outstanding shares it didn’t already own. The deal follows the announcement earlier this week that Cargill Inc. and Continental Grain Co. were buying Sanderson Farms for $4.53 billion and taking it private.
JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, now will look more like  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN)., the top poultry producer and biggest meat company by sales in the U.S. Having segments for beef, pork and poultry mean companies such as Tyson are better able to smooth out results when one meat is struggling, but also that each protein category gets less time in the limelight on quarterly calls.
Sanderson Farms, in particular, was known for transparency, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) & Chase Co. analyst Ken Goldman.
“There was no sugar-coating from this management team, no half-invented responses when full ones were unavailable, and certainly no buzzwords,” Goldman said in a note earlier this week.
That insight now may be reserved not for retail investors but Cargill, the largest private company in the U.S. that had its best earnings in its 156-year history during its latest fiscal year.
Meanwhile, the mergers may add to the concerns of farmers groups and lawmakers including U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who have said such deals should be scrutinized with much of the meat industry already held by a small group of big companies.
“This is yet another example of consolidation in a market that is already dominated by just a handful of firms,” Rob Larew, head of the National Farmers Union, said in an email, referring to the Sanderson Farms deal.

Investing.com – SoFi Technologies stock (NASDAQ:SOFI) slumped 14% Friday after a second quarter loss that was wider than expected.
The fintech reiterated its 2021 outlook. For the full-year, it forecasts adjusted net revenue of $980 million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $27 million.
The company has already logged $453.25 million in revenue in the first six months of the year.
Its second-quarter adjusted net revenue jumped 74% to $237.21 million as both members and products registered strong growth on the back of an expanded slate of offerings. Total members grew 113% year-over-year and total products grew 123%.
But the company’s bottom line came in red. Net loss came in at $165.31 million compared to a net income of $7.80 million.
The loss was attributed to adjustments related to its $1.2 billion cash and stock acquisition of payments platform Galileo Financial in April 2020.  
Sofi remeasured its valuation allowance of 2020 as a result of the deferred tax liabilities recognized in connection with the Galileo acquisition. This decreased the valuation allowance by $99.8 million. The absence of that tax benefit was a key reason behind the company making losses in the second quarter.
There were also significant non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and fair value changes in warrants primarily related to the fair market value of SoFi stock.

75,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2021 12:57PM ET</span>","Airbnb warns of Delta impact on bookings, shares fall over 4%","(Reuters) - Airbnb Inc said on Thursday its current-quarter bookings could be hit by the Delta variant of the coronavirus and a slowing pace of vaccination in the United States, sending its shares down more than 4%.
The company expects nights and experiences booked in the current quarter to slow from the second quarter and remain below 2019 levels. 
""As we exit the second quarter and come into the third, we have a combination of fewer bookings for the fall, just given the nature of some of the seasonality and any kind of impact potentially on COVID concerns,"" Chief Financial Officer Dave Stephenson said on a post-earnings call with investors.
The hugely popular global app, which has fought back strongly since being hit hard early in the pandemic last year, posted a more than four-fold rise in bookings to $13.4 billion in the second quarter.
It expects the third quarter to be its strongest on record as more people check into its vacation rentals after the easing of COVID-19 curbs in most major economies.
Active listings have been roughly stable throughout the health crisis and grew during the quarter, especially in non-urban destinations across Europe and North America, the company said.
""In popular leisure markets you're seeing platforms offer increasingly generous incentives to hosts to secure quality inventory in order to meet demand,"" wrote Dan Thomas, analyst at Third Bridge. 
Hotels and other accommodation providers took a hammering last year as COVID-19 travel restrictions shut down large parts of their business. 

Airbnb drew plaudits, however, for shifting its focus quickly to local and long-term rentals, attracting people looking for accommodations to rent for remote working or which did not require flying.
The company expects to report record third-quarter adjusted income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and margin.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Tesla hopes to make the first cars at its ""Gigafactory"" in Gruenheide, near Berlin, in October or soon afterwards, Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Friday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has pushed back the expected opening of the gigafactory to late 2021, blaming German bureaucratic hurdles. The plant has also faced local public resistance due to environmental concerns. 
""We're looking forward to hopefully getting the approval to make the first cars maybe in October if we are fortunate,"" Musk said on a visit to the plant with Armin Laschet, Germany's conservative candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor.
Yet the environmental agency in Brandenburg has yet to give final approval, meaning a further delay cannot be ruled out, even until 2022.
Tesla has faced resistance over the plant whose site partly overlaps a drinking water protection zone and borders a nature reserve.
""This region has so much water, look around you,"" Musk said at the factory when asked about the water concerns. ""It's like water everywhere here. Does this seem like a desert to you?"" he asked, laughing. ""It rains a lot.""
""We've gotten a lot of support and that's very much appreciated,"" he said. ""We feel very welcome and we're very happy to be here in Deutschland.""
He later tweeted he was inviting locals and the wider community to a tour of the plant.
""Giga Berlin-Brandenburg county fair & factory tour on 9 October!"" he tweeted. ""Priority for residents of Brandenburg & Berlin, but also open to general public"".
RED TAPE
Laschet, whose personal approval ratings have dropped ahead of a Sept. 26 federal election after he was seen laughing on a visit to a flood-stricken town, said Germany needed to cut red tape.
""Sometimes one has the impression that inventing something new is technologically easier than dismantling bureaucracy in Germany,"" he told reporters, standing side-by-side with Musk. 
Asked if he had any tips for Laschet to help energise his election campaign, Musk replied: ""We're adding energy right now. This plant's all about energy, green energy that's sustainable.""
""Hopefully ... this factory here can serve as an inspiration to people in Germany and throughout Europe for excitement about the future,"" Musk added. 
The CEO called for a periodic review of regulations at local, state, and federal level in Germany, and at EU level, to determine if they are a net benefit.
With ever-more rules, he warned, ""eventually people will not be able to do anything at all.""

""It cannot always be about problems every day. Do you want to wake up every morning and everything's just a problem? Musk asked. ""(I want) people to be inspired about the future, and don't forget to have children - that's important.""
The entrepreneur's girlfriend, pop singer Grimes, last year gave birth to the couple's son who they named X AE A-XII.

77,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2021 12:46PM ET</span>","Pfizer, Moderna seen reaping billions from COVID-19 vaccine booster market","By Michael Erman
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Drugmakers  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc are expected to reap billions of dollars from COVID-19 booster shots in a market that could rival the $6 billion in annual sales for flu vaccines for years to come, analysts and healthcare investors say. 
For several months, the companies have said they expect that fully inoculated people will need an extra dose of their vaccines to maintain protection over time and to fend off new coronavirus variants. 
Now a growing list of governments, including Chile, Germany and Israel, have decided to offer booster doses to older citizens or people with weak immune systems in the face of the fast-spreading Delta variant. 
Late on Thursday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a booster dose of vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc for people with compromised immune systems.
Pfizer, along with its German partner BioNTech, and Moderna have together locked up over $60 billion in sales of the shots just in 2021 and 2022. The agreements include supply of the initial two doses of their vaccines as well as billions of dollars in potential boosters for wealthy nations. 
Going forward, analysts have forecast revenue of over $6.6 billion for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and $7.6 billion for Moderna in 2023, mostly from booster sales. They eventually see the annual market settling at around $5 billion or higher, with additional drugmakers competing for those sales.
    The vaccine makers say that evidence of waning antibody levels in vaccinated people after six months, as well as an increasing rate of breakthrough infections in countries hit by the Delta variant, support the need for booster shots. 
Some early data suggests that the Moderna vaccine, which delivers a higher dose at the outset, may be more durable than Pfizer’s shot, but more research is needed to determine whether that is influenced by the age or underlying health of the people vaccinated.
    As a result, it is far from clear how many people will need boosters, and how often. The profit potential of booster shots may be limited by the number of competitors who enter the market. In addition, some scientists question whether there is enough evidence that boosters are needed, particularly for younger, healthy people. The World Health Organization has asked governments to hold off on booster shots until more people worldwide receive their initial doses.
    ""We don't know what the market forces will be,"" Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in an interview last week. ""At some point, this will become a more traditional market - we'll look at what are the populations at risk, what value are we creating, and what are the number of products that serve that value. That will ultimately impact price.""
Pfizer declined to comment for the story. During the company’s second-quarter earnings call, executives said they believe a third dose will be necessary 6 to 8 months after vaccination, and regularly afterward.
    A MODEL IN FLU SHOTS
    If regular COVID-19 boosters are needed among the general population, the market would most resemble the flu shot business, which distributes more than 600 million doses per year. Four competitors split the U.S. flu market, which is the most lucrative and accounts for around half the global revenue, according to Dave Ross, an executive at CSL (OTC:CSLLY)'s flu vaccine unit Seqirus. 
    Flu vaccination rates in developed countries have settled at around 50% of the population, and COVID boosters would likely follow a similar pattern if approved widely, said Atlantic Equities analyst Steve Chesney.
    Flu shots cost around $18 to $25 a dose, according to U.S. government data and competition has kept price increases in check, with producers raising prices 4 or 5 percent in 2021. 
    Pfizer and Moderna may have greater pricing power for their boosters, at least at the outset, until competitors arrive. Pfizer initially charged $19.50 per dose for its vaccine in the United States and 19.50 euros for the European Union, but has already raised those prices 24% and 25%, respectively, in subsequent supply deals. 
    AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are both gathering additional data on boosters of their vaccines.  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), Curevac, and  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) could also potentially be used as boosters, though their vaccines have yet to receive any regulatory authorization.
    ""A lot of these firms aren't even in the market yet. I think within a year's time, all these companies will have booster strategies,"" said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, who covers Pfizer. 
    Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan expects at least 5 players in the COVID-19 booster market within a few years.
There's still a lot of uncertainty around how boosters would be rolled out in the United States. Still, it is possible or even likely that people will be boosted with different vaccines than they were originally vaccinated with. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is already testing mixed boosting, and other countries that have used so-called mix and match vaccination have not had problems with that strategy.
   One factor that could curb prices is if the U.S. government continues paying for most or all of the shots administered in the country, rather than leave it in the hands of private health insurers. In that scenario, the government would still be negotiating prices directly with vaccine makers, and could use its buying power to stave off price increases.

    Bijan Salehizadeh, managing director at healthcare investment firm Navimed Capital, said the U.S. government is likely going to want to keep paying in order to keep vaccination rates high and prevent new COVID surges, particularly if a Democratic administration is still in power.
""It's going to be paid for until the virus disappears or mutates to be less virulent,"" Salehizadeh said.

Investing.com – Virgin Galactic stock (NYSE:SPCE) fell 3% on Friday after reports that founder Richard Branson sold shares.
Branson, through his vehicle Virgin Investments, sold 10.4 million shares of Virgin Galactic this week at prices ranging from $25.75 to $34.39 apiece, according to an SEC filing. The stake was worth $300 million, according to InsiderScore.com.
Before the stake sale, Branson and entities owned by him held 24% stake in Virgin Galactic. They now hold less than 20% stake in the spaceflight company.
On Wednesday,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded the company’s stock ahead of the 8-month-long grounding of its sole mothership, Eve, for enhancements starting September.
Analyst Kristine Liwag sees the stock at $25. The stock touched a low of $25.11 so far in the session underway today.
During the maintenance period, Virgin Galactic will not conduct any space flights until summer of 2022, according to StreetInsider.
While Liwag views this positively as the company is investing in increasing its long-term space flight capacity, she said such investments take time.
The enhancements planned will enable Eve to fly more than once per week. Before it is grounded, Eva has a flight scheduled in September.
According to Liwag, another successful flight could be a catalyst for the stock.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc subscribers have filed a proposed class action lawsuit accusing the maker of at-home stationary bicycles of improperly charging sales tax on memberships in New York, Virginia and Massachusetts.
In a complaint filed on Thursday night in federal court in Manhattan, Brandon Skillern and Ryan Corken said Peloton should have treated its $39-a-month ""All Access"" and $12.99-a-month digital memberships as tax-exempt ""digital goods"" in the three states.
They said Peloton has refused to reimburse them for the 6.3% or 8.9% ""sales tax"" it had collected before Jan. 1, when it changed its taxation practices. Millions of dollars nationwide may have been collected improperly, they said. 
Peloton ""willfully and knowingly overcharged its subscribers"" to maximize profit, according to the complaint.
The New York-based company declined to comment on Friday, saying it does not discuss pending litigation. Lawyers for the plaintiffs had no immediate additional comment.
Skillern moved last year to Vienna, Virginia, from the New York City borough of Brooklyn, while Corken lives in Reading, Massachusetts.
They are seeking unspecified compensatory, punitive and triple damages for breach of contract, and violations of New York and Virginia consumer protection laws. 
Peloton is scheduled to release fiscal fourth-quarter results on Aug. 26.
Revenue more than doubled in the nine months ended March 31 as the pandemic led to more people working out at home.

In May, Peloton agreed to recall its Tread+ treadmill, which a U.S. regulator linked to dozens of incidents and at least one death, after initially resisting.

So, read on for a closer look at these companies.The major stock market indexes soared recently on the U.S. Senate’s passage of a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill on August 10. The bill includes $7.5 billion in funding for electric vehicle (EV) charging networks. However, many consider the budget insufficient, and a group of 28 U.S. House Democrats have asked for $85 billion in funding for EV charging infrastructure.
Nevertheless, the bill's passage in the Senate is seen as a significant step toward President Biden’s goal of the construction of 500,000 EV charging stations in the U.S. over the next decade. Furthermore, the industry is expected to grow quickly because it plays an essential role in contributing to the worldwide adoption of EVs to replace internal-combustion vehicles.

The company, which is backed by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp, said the health crisis dampened its expectations for a rebound in average revenue per member, particularly in the United States and Canada, for 2021 and 2022.
The fast-spreading variant and the subsequent tightening of curbs in some places have compounded worries for office space providers, as businesses opt for shorter leases and many employees continue to work remotely.
WeWork said it had 517,000 members in the second quarter ended June 30, a drop from 612,000 in the year-ago period. 
The hybrid-work strategy will help improve sales, the company said, adding that it still expects preliminary July revenue to come in at about $215 million, with $650 million to $700 million sales for the third quarter.
In a hybrid workplace model, employees have the ability to work in different spaces, including corporate offices, coworking spaces, public areas and from home. 
WeWork in March agreed to go public through a merger with BowX Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company, in a deal that valued it at $9 billion. SoftBank said it would retain a majority stake in the company after the merger.

Net loss attributable to WeWork was $888.85 million in the second quarter, compared with $863.83 million a year earlier.
Quarterly revenue dipped nearly 1% to $593.48 million from the first quarter.

98,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2021 10:00AM ET</span>","Yardeni Says ‘Roaring 2020s’ to Continue, and Stock Bulls Agree","(Bloomberg) -- There’s little reason for stock bulls to have an epiphany with the S&P 500 almost doubling from its pandemic lows. But they do have several motives to keep their faith in the equity market.
“Earnings have been on fire,” Ed Yardeni, the president of his eponymously named research firm, said on Bloomberg TV’s Surveillance Thursday. “My bullishness is based on my perception that there’s no recession ahead, there’s no credit crunch ahead, and there’s still higher earnings ahead.”
With a nod toward history, the Wall Street veteran called the current era “The Roaring 2020s,” and affirmed his forecast for the index to reach 5,000 by the end of next year -- a 12% increase from Thursday’s close.
“But 5,000 is actually a fairly conservative outlook. It’s the end of next year,” he said. “There’s plenty of times for earnings to grow along that time.” He pointed to rising productivity helping to drive growth. Productivity “is up 2%,” Yardeni said. “I think it’s going to 4%.”
Another stock-market bull, David Kostin, the chief U.S. equity strategist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., sees the S&P 500 at 4,700 at year end on the way to 4,900 by the close of 2022. The index closed at of 4,460.83 on Thursday.
“The U.S. economy will be in nominal terms around 8% higher this year than pre-pandemic 2019,” Kostin said in a Surveillance interview. “Sales for the S&P 500 companies will be 15% higher and earnings will be 34% higher. That is a representation of the operating leverage that exists in so many companies.”
The return from equities is difficult for investors to ignore, he said.
“The opportunity set for investors in other asset classes is really not very attractive,” Kostin said. “Equities become the proverbial term -- there is no alternative. This is sort of a money flow story about why there is likely to be persistent demand for U.S. stocks. And that’s likely to push the market higher.”

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's path to a sustained recovery in its theme parks business will rest on one question: Can the entertainment giant keep its parks open for the rest of the year?
Disney's chief financial officer, Christine McCarthy, said on Thursday the company's theme parks were expected to be fully staffed by the end of this year to cater to the rising demand.
Those plans could be upended by the spread of the more infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has been ravaging Florida, home to Disney's biggest park, as well as other U.S. states with lower vaccination rates.
""Disney's ability to keep its parks and resorts open is clearly of the utmost importance to their bottom line,"" said Joe McCormack, analyst at Third Bridge.
""Whether (parks remain open) will largely be driven by Delta variant.""
While the success of the company's video-streaming operations cheered others on Wall Street, some analysts and investors worried about the prospects for the parks.
""It is clear that parks will not return to full capacity for some time,"" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said.
For now, Disney executives struck a confident tone and said demand for its parks has not wavered.
""The primary noise we're seeing right now are really around group or convention cancellations,"" Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek said. ""But on the whole, we see really strong demand for our parks.""
Disney shares rose 4.7% to $187.69 in premarket trading on Friday, after upbeat third-quarter results prompted at least six brokerage groups to raise their price targets on the stock.
The virus has also had varying impact on the domestic and international businesses of theme park operators.
Link to graphic on theme park operators swinging to a profit: https://tmsnrt.rs/3m1lo9Y
One big factor weighing against a full recovery is the deterioration of international air travel, experts said.
""That could hold back attendance at parks – particularly international parks like Paris and Hong Kong that rely on cross-border travel,"" said Nicholas Hyett, analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).

Disney, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) have been upbeat about their domestic businesses but offered a cautious view on their international operations, which depend heavily on tourist inflows.
Airbnb Inc and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) both warned this week that the spreading of the delta variant could hit their operations.

Expenses on sales and marketing, R&D and general administration all rose as the company pushed to expand overseas and make its way through a crowded market of grocery deliveries. Costs and expenses more than doubled to $1.33 billion, surpassing revenue of $1.23 billion.

(Reuters) -The Dow and the S&P 500 were set to open at record highs on Friday after Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS)'s forecast-beating results, while signs of cooling inflation and a strong recovery in corporate earnings kept the indexes on track for a second straight week of gains.
Disney jumped 4.6% in premarket trading after it topped Wall Street expectations for quarterly earnings as its streaming services picked up more customers than expected and pandemic-hit U.S. theme parks returned to profitability.
Airbnb Inc slipped 2.7% after it flagged a hit to its current-quarter bookings by the Delta variant of the coronavirus and a slowing pace of U.S. vaccination.
A stellar earnings season, improving economic data and the Senate's passage of a large infrastructure bill have all reinforced investors' belief in the economic recovery, pushing U.S. stocks to all-time highs in the past few sessions.
Concerns over higher inflation and a sooner-than-anticipated policy tapering by the Federal Reserve also ebbed after data earlier this week showed the pace of increase in U.S. consumer prices slowed in July even as producer prices posted their biggest annual increase in more than a decade.
""What we know about inflation at this point is that it remains relatively high, but it doesn't appear to be getting a lot worse at the moment,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW).
""High inflation is not always a bad thing if it's accompanied by strong economic growth and right now it is just indicative that the economy is doing very well.""
Investors are looking ahead to the minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting, due next week, and the annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later in August for fresh cues on policy.
At 8:22 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 56 points, or 0.16%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 2.5 points, or 0.06%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 11.25 points, or 0.07%.
So far this week, the Dow and the S&P 500 have risen 0.8% and 0.5% respectively, boosted by gains in economically sensitive stocks. 
DoorDash Inc slid 4.5% after the food-delivery firm's loss widened more than expected in the second quarter as it spent heavily to expand internationally and into a crowded market for grocery during the pandemic.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc gained 0.4% and 2.1% respectively, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a booster dose of their COVID-19 vaccines for people with compromised immune systems.

Investing.com – Airbnb stock (NASDAQ:ABNB) slipped 3% in Friday’s premarket trading as the company said the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus will continue to affect overall travel behavior, potentially resulting in bookings in the current quarter falling below the previous one.
The company said July-September Nights and Experiences bookings will be lower than the level in the same quarter of 2019, although they will significantly outperform the 2020 quarter.
The company said how often and when guests book and cancel their travel plans will remain affected. 
The delta variant is wrecking plans of most companies just when they were beginning to bounce back from last year’s lockdowns. The coronavirus variant, which raged in India April-May, is now spreading fast in the U.S., parts of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Latin America.
Nonetheless, Airbnb expects July-September revenue to be its strongest quarterly revenue on record and to deliver the highest adjusted Ebitda and margin ever.
In the second quarter, the company’s Nights and Experiences Booked almost trebled to 83.1 million. Gross booking value soared 320% to $13.4 billion while revenue quadrupled to $1.3 billion.
Net loss significantly narrowed to $68 million from $575 million in June quarter of 2020.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Olam International is considering raising about 2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) through a London listing of its food ingredients unit next year, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, as the Singapore-based trading house seeks to boost its valuation and step up acquisitions.
The company, one of the world's biggest agricultural commodity traders, is listing Olam Food Ingredients (OFI) as part of a business overhaul flagged last year https://www.reuters.com/article/olam-intl-restructuring-idUSL4N29O16P to focus on the two core businesses of OFI and Olam Global Agri (OGA) after the sale of sugar, rubber and other portfolios.
""It will be a substantial IPO. It will be amongst the larger IPOs done on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in the recent past,"" co-founder and CEO Sunny Verghese told Reuters in an interview, while declining to give a fundraising target.
The proceeds would allow OFI to accelerate growth and also accelerate acquisitions, he added.
""One of the reasons that we are doing this exercise of re-organising is to make sure that we can focus and simplify a fairly diverse complex portfolio,"" Verghese said
Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings became Olam's controlling shareholder in 2014 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olam-temasek-idUSBREA2C2EW20140314 after the trader's accounting practices were questioned by short-seller Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) in 2012. Mitsubishi Corp became a shareholder in 2015.
""London being a major financial centre has no lack of liquidity and more importantly has investors who know how to price these things correctly,"" said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore.
OFI's portfolio includes cocoa, coffee and edible nuts, while Olam Global Agri (OGA) comprises grains, edible oils, rice and cotton, among others.
OFI and OGA's competitors include privately-held Louis Dreyfus, Swiss-listed Barry Callebaut and Archer-Daniels-Midland, some of whom have revamped their businesses amid stiff competition.
Olam's shares, which have a small float, ended up 2.8% on Friday, valuing the company at S$5.5 billion.
Verghese said OFI could join London's FTSE-100 index of blue-chip companies.
A valuation above 4 billion pounds would enable OFI to get into the index and obtain a premium listing - which would require the company to have a free float of at least 25% and meet a tougher set of corporate governance requirements.
Winning OFI's listing would be a boon for the LSE, which is trying to attract more global companies following Britain's exit from the European Union.
Olam has said it is seeking a concurrent secondary listing in Singapore for OFI by the first half of 2022.
Two of the sources said Olam had appointed  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to work on OFI's IPO. Four of the banks declined to comment, while there was no response from Morgan Stanley.
Verghese said OFI's IPO could be completed by the second quarter of next year, and OGA could be listed as early as the fourth quarter of 2022.

On Friday, Olam reported a more than doubling of first-half operational profit, excluding exceptional items, to a record S$436.6 million ($321.5 million)
($1 = 0.7242 pounds)

106,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2021 07:46AM ET</span>",Disney bullish on parks despite Delta; investors cheer streaming growth,"By Lisa Richwine and Tiyashi Datta
(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co earnings on Thursday topped Wall Street forecasts for the most recent quarter as its streaming services picked up more customers than expected and pandemic-hit U.S. theme parks returned to profitability.
Shares of the entertainment company rose 5% in after-hours trading. Before the earnings report, shares were roughly flat from the start of the year.
Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said that upcoming theme park reservations at the company's two U.S. parks, including the flagship Walt Disney World, remained strong, even as COVID cases surge https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR. 
""We are still bullish about our parks business going forward,"" CEO Bob Chapek said on a call with analysts. Reservations are currently outpacing attendance for the quarter that just ended, executives said. 
Florida, home to Walt Disney World, is the epicenter of the latest U.S. COVID outbreak, posting record cases and hospitalizations in recent days. 
Disney was more optimistic than some other companies about the Delta variant's impact on operations. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/southwest-airlines-says-may-not-be-profitable-third-quarter-2021-08-11 and vacation rental firm AirBnB https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbnb-results/airbnb-promises-record-third-quarter-but-warns-on-delta-impact-idUSKBN2FD24S both warned that the surge in cases could hurt their businesses.
For April through July 3, Disney posted earnings per share of 80 cents, excluding certain items. Wall Street had expected 55 cents, according to the average projection of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. 
Disney's theme parks welcomed more visitors as pandemic restrictions eased. Theme park revenue rose for the first time in five quarters, hitting $4.34 billion.
Net income for that division, which includes consumer products, reached $356 million, compared with a loss of nearly $1.9 billion a year earlier when many Disney parks were closed. The U.S. parks eked out a profit of $2 million, while international parks lost $210 million.
“We think Disney’s U.S. parks breaking even this quarter is an important turning point for the entertainment giant,"" Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). ""It has weathered the storm, and strong results from the parks have helped it beat analyst expectations.""
Disney has staked its future on building streaming services to compete with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the crowded market for online entertainment.
Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ - the company's three online subscription offerings - gained close to 15 million new subscribers to total nearly 174 million. Disney+ had 116 million paying customers at the end of the quarter, just ahead of the 115.2 million consensus of analysts surveyed by FactSet.
""It is apparent that Disney+ is now an indispensable video streaming service alongside Netflix,"" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said. 
During the quarter, Disney+ featured ""Loki,"" a series about the shape-shifting Marvel villain, and offered Emma Stone movie ""Cruella"" on the same day it hit theaters.
At the media and entertainment distribution unit, operating income fell 32% from the prior year, to $2.0 billion, as programming costs rose. A year earlier, cable network ESPN's bills had been reduced when many sporting events were canceled.
The direct-to-consumer division, which includes Disney+, reported a loss of $293 million as it invested in TV shows, movies and other costs. That compared to a loss of $624 million a year earlier.

The company's overall revenue rose 45% to $17.02 billion in the third quarter, topping analysts' estimate of $16.76 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Net income from continuing operations was $923 million, or 50 cents per share, compared with a loss of $4.72 billion, or $2.61 per share, a year earlier.

Investing.com – Contextlogic stock (NASDAQ:WISH) slumped by 29% in Friday’s premarket trading as the ecommerce platform’s second-quarter performance deteriorated on most metrics including revenue, income and user engagement.
June-quarter revenue fell 6% from the same period a year ago to $656 million as daily user activity and active buyers on its ‘Wish’ platform declined more than it had anticipated, particularly in the U.S., France and Italy - three of its largest markets.
Globally, ContextLogic saw a 13% reduction in app installs and a 15% fall in average time spent on its platform compared to January-March as people stepped out after a year of being home-locked and highetened level of pandemic-induced shopping came off.   
There were more woes for the company. The cost of digital advertising on leading ad platforms, which the company has historically used to drive demand and conversion on its app, increased more than it expected. In addition, the recent privacy changes for iOS caused more advertisers to shift spend to Android devices, creating more competition for a limited supply of impressions.
Updates to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) privacy policy have made it tougher for apps to track users and source their personal data for targeting them with their ads.
As a result, the company incurred higher marketing costs but ended up achieving lower efficiency.
The net loss soared to $111 million from $11 million in last year’s June quarter."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher Friday, with a generally positive week coming to an end, boosted by a rebounding labor market and strong corporate earnings.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 35 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, less than 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures was largely flat.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broad-based S&P 500 are on track to finish the week with gains of 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively, both new record highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has underperformed this week, down 0.1%.
Helping the tone has been a generally strong earnings season, with over 90% of the S&P 500 companies having already reported, and about 88% of them beating expectations, according to data from Refinitiv.
Entertainment giant Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) provided further evidence of this after the close Thursday, beating expectations for the most recent quarter as its streaming services picked up more customers than expected and pandemic-hit U.S. theme parks returned to profitability.
Economic data this week has shown that the U.S. economy is growing robustly, with the labor market rebounding as weekly jobless claims fell for the third week running. However, Covid-19 remains a headwind, and this is likely to limit consumer confidence going forward. 
The main data release Friday comes in the form of the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), and is seen unchanged from last month at 81.2. 
Oil prices slipped lower Friday, amid growing concerns that the spread of the Covid-19 delta variant will curtail oil demand growth as the year progresses.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.%3 at $68.82 a barrel, while Brent futures dropped 0.2% at $71.16 a barrel.
The flare-up of Covid cases in China, the second largest consumer of oil in the world, is causing the most concern. Authorities there have taken an aggressive approach to containing the outbreak, including shutting down one of the world’s busiest container ports after one case was reported.
The IEA predicted, in a report released Thursday, that demand growth would be half a million barrels per day lower in the second half of the year compared with its estimate last month, citing new Covid-19 restrictions.
The weekly update from Baker Hughes of the number of oil rigs will be of interest later Friday, while the CFTC will release its weekly commitments of traders report."

LONDON (Reuters) -Investors have made a beeline into so-called ""value trades"", adding cash into European stocks and financial and material shares during the past week, BofA's weekly statistics showed on Friday, keeping the region's markets on a record-breaking run.
At $1.5 billion, Europe saw the biggest inflow in eight weeks while financial stocks saw a chunky $2.6 billion of inflows, the largest in 10 weeks, the U.S. investment bank said. 
European stocks hit new highs on Friday and looked set to extend gains for a record tenth straight session.[MKTS/GLOB]
""We say own defensive quality in second half,"" said Michael Hartnett, BofA's chief investment strategist
The renewed interest in relatively cheaper sectors of the market came at the cost of the familiar market darlings including technology stocks which saw their smallest inflows in seven weeks.
Materials and financials stocks are considered relatively undervalued currently as they are perceived to be still suffering from the pandemic-induced economic downturn. But analysts believe their fortunes will turn if larger economies continue to recover. 
Global equity funds enjoyed inflows of $15.7 billion as private clients of the U.S. investment bank holding $3.2 trillion in assets increased their allocation to stocks to a record high of 65%.
Market participants say the single most important factor for them is what the U.S. Federal Reserve will do next as it looks to gradually roll back emergency pandemic measures, but inflation data this week has been fairly confusing for market watchers.
BoFA noted the cost of shipping a 40-foot box container from Shanghai to Rotterdam has jumped to $14,000 from $2,000, 18 months ago.

Factory-gate inflation is popping higher in the United States, China and Japan, the note said. That is squeezing many firms' profit margins and raising the risk of a followthrough jump in consumer prices.
Data on Thursday showed U.S. producer prices posted their largest annual increase in more than a decade in the 12 months through July, adding pressure on the Fed to reduce stimulus at its next policy meeting in September.

The bill is a companion to a measure introduced this week by a bipartisan trio of senators which would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use alternate app stores and payment systems.
Representative Ken Buck, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee antitrust panel, introduced the measure along with Representative Hank Johnson, a Democrat.
""For far too long, companies like Google and Apple have had a stranglehold on app developers who are forced to take whatever terms these monopolists set in order to reach their customers,"" Buck said in an email statement.

Investing.com – Walt  Disney  stock (NYSE:DIS) was up almost 5% in Friday’s premarket trading as people returned to its theme parks and more users paid for its streaming services to help its third-quarter earnings beat estimates comfortably.
Earnings per share for the quarter ended July 3 came in at 80 cents, well past the 54 cents analysts estimated.
A good part of Disney’s business of theme parks, movie production and cruises was shut last year due to the pandemic-induced lockdown. One of them rolled on and that was the streaming operations.
According to Reuters, reservations at the company's two U.S. parks, including the flagship Walt Disney World, remained strong, and are currently outpacing attendance for the quarter that just ended.
Florida, Walt Disney World’s home, is the epicenter of the latest surge in COVID cases.
Disney Parks, experiences and products revenue for the quarter increased to $4.3 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the prior-year quarter as people thronged public spaces after a year of being closeted at home.
Across its three online subscription offerings of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, the company gained close to 15 million new subscribers to close the quarter with 174 million.
Disney+ had 116 million paying customers at the end of the quarter, more than doubling its base in a year to emerge as a rival to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) which had 209 million subscribers at the end of June.
Revenue of the direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, rose 57% to $4.3 billion while operating loss more than halved to $293 million. At both Hulu and Disney, subscription revenue rose while programming costs weighed.
Domestic channels revenue for the quarter increased 13% to $5.6 billion and operating income decreased 37% to $1.8 billion. The decrease in operating income was due to a decrease at cable and to a lesser extent, at broadcasting, the company said.
Disney attributed the decrease at cable to higher programming and production costs and to a lesser extent, an increase in marketing costs, partially offset by higher advertising.
Programming and production costs rose due to the return of live sports events.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Expectations are growing that BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) Ltd will deliver a verdict on the future of its petroleum business at its results next week, as it comes under increasing pressure to cut its fossil fuel footprint.
The world's biggest miner has been facing calls to detail how and when it will exit fossil fuels, with activist investor Market Forces filing a resolution on the topic this week for annual meetings in October and November.
BHP's decision this month to approve $802 million in development spending on oil projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico - just days before a new report that issued dire warnings about human contribution to climate change - has only ratcheted up pressure from some investors.
""It's clear something is brewing,"" said Simon Mawhinney, Chief Investment Officer at Allan Gray Australia.
BHP declined to comment on market speculation.
Analysts value BHP's petroleum business, made up of assets in Australia, the Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago and Algeria, at $10 billion to $17 billion. The division contributed 5% of BHP's underlying earnings of $14.7 billion in the first half to end-December, compared with 70% for iron ore.
Investors are split on their fit within BHP's portfolio, especially as the company focuses on new economy materials such as copper, nickel and potash.
An exit from petroleum would constitute ""a major shift"" in BHP's environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials and overall strategy towards fossil fuels,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rahul Anand said in a recent note.
AUSTRALIA AND THE REST
BHP's late-life, mainly low-return energy assets in Australia are seen as particularly ripe for a sale amid high oil and gas prices.
""For BHP, if you look at its Australian (energy) assets, if they could exit those in a meaningful way for something approximating value, that would be a good outcome,"" said Brenton Saunders, a portfolio manager with shareholder Pendal Group.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Citi value the Australian energy assets - including the Bass Strait, Northwest Shelf LNG and the Scarborough gas field - at $3 billion to $5 billion.
Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum Ltd is seen as the most logical buyer as they would boost its free cash flow and increase its stakes in key projects, although not all investors favour such a tie-up given the asset mix and likely need for an equity raising.
Woodside declined to comment.
BHP would also have to take a discount on any sale given some heavy decommissioning liabilities, said Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic, although a sale could boost its ESG rating and attract new shareholders.
""BHP could sell these for discounts but still increase share value though a re-rating on the rest of their business,"" he said.
Elsewhere, investors say BHP's petroleum assets are more attractive.
The most valuable are its stakes in oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico, valued at $10.4 billion by Wood Mackenzie, which made up about 25% of the company's 103 million barrels of oil equivalent output the year to June 2021.

""The rest of the portfolio, there are parts that are high growth, high returning. They've done a lot of work on them and shareholders have had to wear some of the bad times. They are good assets,"" said Pendal Group's Saunders.

(Reuters) - The third-largest U.S. public pension fund on Thursday said it is launching reviews over climate concerns on $640 million invested in 42 shale oil and gas firms, including ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Hess (NYSE:HES) and  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD). 
The move by the New York state pension fund comes days after the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported global warming was nearly out of control, and calling its findings ""a death knell for coal and fossil fuels."" 
Major investors, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) have re-evaluated holdings in fossil fuel producers and prodded energy executives to reduce emissions and prepare for a lower carbon world. After completing its shale review, the New York fund plans to turn next to oil and gas pipeline and processing investments, it said. 
Pioneer said it looked forward to working with the New York State Comptroller and that it is ""committed to being a low-carbon, low-cost energy producer.""
""We engage with our shareholders on a regular basis to ensure we are being responsive to their concerns,"" a spokesperson said. 
ConocoPhillips declined to comment, and Hess declined to comment but pointed to its annual Sustainability Report. 
""This announcement is very significant given the size of the pension fund. It has significant influence related to all issues related to investments,"" said Richard Brooks of environmental activist group Stand.earth. 
The $268 billion New York fund already sold some coal assets, and on Thursday disclosed it would restrict investment in others, including stakes in New Hope (OTC:NHPEF) Corp and Whitehaven Coal. 
It plans to review a wide range of shale oil and gas producers as part of a climate action plan announced last year. The systematic review of energy investments aims to reach net zero emissions for its investment portfolio by 2040. 

""We want to see our companies succeed and want them to be around. ... We're just deeply concerned that companies with the greatest exposure to transition risk are at risk of not making that transition successfully,"" said Liz Gordon, executive director of corporate governance for the fund. 
New York Common Retirement Fund recently restricted investments in six Canadian oil sands companies, including Exxon (NYSE:XOM)'s Imperial Oil (NYSE:IMO) Ltd and Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources.

But he has two other trials to face - one in which he is accused of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation and another in which he is accused of unlawfully using a sedative.
The following is a timeline of Lee's legal woes.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2021 04:11AM ET</span>","Thinner and contrite, Samsung's leader walks out of jail on parole","By Dogyun Kim and Joyce Lee
UIWANG, South Korea (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee, convicted of bribery and embezzlement, walked out of prison on parole on Friday, with South Korea's president calling on the public for understanding over his controversial release.
Broad support for his parole grew amid anxiety that major strategic decisions are not being made at the world's biggest memory chip and smartphone manufacturer without him. President Moon Jae-in's office said the decision to release Lee was in the national interest.
But civic groups have slammed his parole as another sign of leniency for the country's business elite and one that undermines its justice system.
Lee, 53, appeared outside the Seoul Detention Center, wearing a dark grey suit and looking much thinner than when he was last detained in January. Convicted of bribing a friend of former President Park Geun-hye, he served 18 months of a revised 30-month sentence. 
""I've caused much concern for the people. I deeply apologise,"" Lee told reporters. ""I am listening to the concerns, criticisms, worries and high expectations for me. I will work hard.""
He went straight to Samsung (KS:005930) headquarters after his release. 
South Koreans have long had an uneasy relationship with the founding families of the country's chaebols, veering between anger over their many privileges and scandals, and recognition that the conglomerates are also responsible for much of the country's economic success.
""We are well aware that there are supporting and opposing views on Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee's parole. The views of the people who are opposed are also right,"" Moon's office said in a statement.
""On the other hand, there have been many people who called for his parole in this severe crisis, hoping that he will help the country with respect to semiconductors and vaccines.""
BIG DECISIONS AWAIT
Business leaders and some lawmakers have argued Lee has sufficient influence overseas to help South Korea obtain more COVID-19 vaccines. 
Concerns have also increased that Samsung needs a steady hand at the helm to help it remain competitive in the chip sector amid a global shortage and at a time when rivals like TSMC and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) are making large investments.
One of the decisions Lee is expected to make is the final call on the location of a $17 billion U.S. plant that will produce advanced logic chips.
While Samsung has three CEOs in charge of its main divisions and its day-to-day operations have not been affected by Lee's absence, company sources say major investment and M&A decisions should only be made by Lee.
Before he resumes work, however, Lee must gain separate justice ministry approval, though the decision is expected to be a formality.
In a symbolic move that appeared timed to coincide with his release, Samsung on Thursday made good on a promise by Lee with an announcement that it had signed its first agreements with four company labour unions which cover the provisions of offices and assurances that union activities will be allowed. 
Lee initially served one year of a five-year sentence from August 2017 which was later suspended. That court decision was then overturned and while the sentence was shortened, he was sent back to jail in January this year.
His parole comes after the Justice Ministry last month eased eligibility guidelines for first-time offenders with good behaviour like Lee to about 60% of sentence term served. The average eligible time for all criminals in South Korea was 80% prior to the easing.

Lee still has other legal woes https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-leader-jay-y-lees-other-legal-woes-2021-08-09 to grapple with. He is also on trial accused of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger of two Samsung companies. The first hearing of a separate case, in which he has been accused of unlawfully using a sedative, is expected on Sep. 7. 
Lee has denied the accusations in both cases.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's major oil refiners have recovered from last year's steep losses with all reporting a profit for the April-June quarter, but they continue to face headwinds as COVID-19 cases spiral https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/top-japan-health-adviser-wants-stricter-covid-19-measures-about-two-weeks-2021-08-12 to record highs in the country's fifth wave of the pandemic. 
Eneos, Japan's biggest refiner that accounts for about half of Japan's fuel market, on Friday reported profit of 98 billion yen ($888 million) for the first fiscal quarter, versus a 5 billion yen loss a year earlier. Sales rose 44% but were 12% below the same quarter in 2019 before the pandemic.
""The impact of the spike in new coronavirus variant infections is uncertain and there is a risk that the recovery in fuel demand will be delayed,"" Eneos Senior Vice President Soichiro Tanaka told reporters.
Idemitsu Kosan reported last week a net income of 88 billion yen versus a year-earlier loss of about the same amount, but warned future profits may be strained as the pandemic clouds the outlook at home and overseas.
Japan's top health adviser has requested for stricter COVID-19 curbs to control the contagion, which he said should be treated as a natural disaster, while the International Energy Agency (IEA) has flagged a hit to global oil demand https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/spread-covid-19-delta-variant-knocks-oil-demand-outlook-iea-2021-08-12 due to the spread of the more infectious Delta variant of the virus.

Japan's refiners, which have been cutting capacity as long-term fuel demand wanes with the country's declining population, were hit hard last year when the pandemic briefly led to negative oil prices https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN2210V9.
Their sales have not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels and, in the quarter just ended, were as much as a fifth below that of the same period in 2019. 
Sales for Cosmo Energy, which swung to a 28 billion yen quarterly profit, rose 20% from a year earlier but were still down 22% from the same period in 2019.
The IEA said on Thursday the rising demand for oil abruptly reversed course in July this year and was set for a slower recovery through the end of 2021.
""Growth for the second half of 2021 has been downgraded more sharply, as new COVID-19 restrictions imposed in several major oil consuming countries, particularly in Asia, look set to reduce mobility and oil use,"" it said.

121,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2021 03:01AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Muddied Waters,"A look at the day ahead from Saikat Chatterjee. 
Investors can be forgiven for being nonplussed on the data front this week. A day after U.S. consumer inflation data showed early signs of price pressures peaking, readings from the producer perspective showed inflationary readings remained firm. 
That confusion was evident in global markets too. 
World stocks are set to sign off the week on a record high while the U.S. Treasury yield curve is still trading near its flattest levels this year, a sign that bond punters remain concerned about inflation. 
For now, the Federal Reserve can maintain its assertion that inflation rises are temporary.
But a majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the Fed to taper its asset purchases in September -- the jobs market is stronger and Fed officials appear to be more willing to discuss tapering the $120 billion monthly asset purchases. 
Until fresh data adds to the taper debate, markets will likely remain in summer torpor mode. 
Even a widening regulatory crackdown in China has failed to ignite broader market unease with the VIX “fear gauge” dropping to a five-week low, and a U.S. equity put/call ratio slipping below already very low levels. 
European and U.S. stock futures are generally flat, with the second quarter earnings season supporting sentiment. U.S. investment grade companies have recorded an impressive 30% earnings growth in the June quarter compared to the similar period two years ago, Citibank estimates. 
Favourable readings were evident in Europe too with banks, historically laggards, posting impressive results. 
The spoiler in the cautiously optimistic markets outlook remains the surging Delta variant of COVID-19, especially in Asia. Malaysia's central bank on Friday slashed its 2021 economic outlook due to the COVID surge. Australia’s two largest cities – Sydney and Melbourne – remain in extended lockdown. 
Elsewhere, oil prices fell for a second day, while the U.S. dollar held near four-month highs against its rivals.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday: 
- Europe macro: France unemployment, final July CPI, euro June trade balance.
- U.S. macro: Import price index, Michigan University sentiment readings.
- British engineering firm Babcock to sell its consultancy unit Frazer-Nash for 293 million pounds ($404.5 million) in cash.

- Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) is selling Reebok to Authentic Brands Group(ABG) for up to 2.1 billion euros.

New Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio has made risk and cultural change a top priority after the bank lost more than $5 billion in the rush to unwind trades by family office Archegos and the collapse of $10 billion in funds backed by insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital.
Credit Suisse has proposed former UBS executive Axel Lehmann to join its board and become chairman of its risk committee. The Swiss executive has a ""a wealth of experience in risk management,"" the bank said.
It also proposed Juan Colombas, who has been an executive director and member of the Audit and Risk Committees at Dutch bank ING Group (NYSE:ING) since 2020.
The bank has called an extraordinary general meeting on Oct. 1 for the pair to be elected to its non-executive board.
""With their deep experience in risk management and business leadership, and both with careers spanning approximately three decades in financial services, they will make an invaluable contribution as we shape the bank’s strategic realignment and enhance our culture of risk management and personal responsibility and accountability,"" said Horta-Osório in a statement.
A ""lackadaisical"" attitude towards risk and ""a lack of accountability"" were to blame for Credit Suisse's $5.5 billion loss on investment fund Archegos, according to a review published last month.

Credit Suisse said action has been taken against 23 staff members over Archegos, with nine fired and a total of $70 million in monetary penalties taken from all of them.
The bank's chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, has also left the bank in April in the wake of the affair.

Most major banks in Australia, including Wall Street firms, have been scrambling to add bankers https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-banks-boutiques-analysis-idUSKBN2BA2RF since the start of the year as part of a campaign to defend their market share against new aggressive boutiques Barrenjoey Capital and Jarden.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), UBS, and Australia's Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) have already hired more than 100 bankers in total this year, their representatives said, amid hopes that ultra-low interest rates and a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic will ensure a strong deals pipeline. 
""There's been quite a hiring spree in investment banking and the last year or 18 months has been about as good as it's been in about five or seven years,"" said Graeme Bricknell, Korn Ferry (NYSE:KFY) head of executive search in Australia and New Zealand.
""It's a significant increase (from two years ago). Some of these places were only hiring one or two people.""
Australia's deal boom https://www.reuters.com/business/australias-deal-boom-set-intensify-cheap-cash-pandemic-confidence-bankers-2021-08-02 and a spike in investment banking fees - to a three-year high of $1.2 billion in 2021, Refinitiv data shows - is fuelling the hiring rush among banks and start-up firms aiming for a juicier share of lucrative mandates.
The country has seen $108.7 billion in M&A deals this year, a record high and more than quadruple the year-earlier level, making it the second-biggest market in the region after China.
NEW HIRES
Credit Suisse hired 52 staff in the first half of 2021, a bank spokesman said. The recruitment took place across each of its businesses in Australia, which includes equity and debt underwriting and M&A advisory, he added.
UBS, which was the main target of Barrenjoey's talent raid https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/moves-around-10-ubs-executives-australia-resign-sources-2021-03-15, has hired 30 staff across investment banking, equities sales and trading and research in the past six months, according to a spokesman.
Morgan Stanley has hired 20 bankers in the past year in a push to take advantage of increased competition for staff across the industry, its Australian CEO Richard Wagner said. 
""We have incrementally grown our Australian headcount every year for the past 20 years. However, this year we stepped it up a notch given the disruption at a number of a competitors,"" Wagner told Reuters.
Macquarie has hired 14 investment bankers since January, it said in a statement to Reuters, adding it has the largest investment banking team in Australia with over 200 bankers.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has added 10 this year, mainly in investment banking, equities and research.

 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) has added four to the banking and capital markets business and another four to its markets and securities division since June, their representatives said.
Barrenjoey and Jarden, after their fierce talent war against global peers, have 275 and 115 staff in Australia, respectively, spokeswomen for the banks said.

124,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2021 01:15AM ET</span>",Australian probe to put spotlight on sexual harassment at mining camps,"By Melanie Burton and Kate Lamb
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's mining industry is bracing for a government inquiry that is expected to shed light on sexual harassment in the country's mineral-rich west, as the sector struggles with a dire skills shortage and low female representation.
Conditions at Western Australia's mining camps have worsened sexual harassment, critics say, and the issue has prompted the industry to take a stand against a culture they say has to change.
Major miners including BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and Fortescue are among those expected to make submissions to the state government inquiry, which will make recommendations to West Australia's parliament in April 2022. Submissions close on Friday and become public next week.
Workers typically live at isolated ""fly-in, fly-out"" (FIFO) camps for a fortnight at a time in Western Australia's mining belt, the source of much of the country's economic prosperity.
Women make up roughly one in five FIFO workers and critics say recreation facilities have become hubs for drinking alcohol and created poor camp cultures that miners need to address.
""There are certain geographic and other issues that make FIFO camps a particular high risk area - part of that is the demographics that are on site,"" said Owen Whittle, a spokesperson for UnionsWA, which represents 30 workers groups and will make a submission to the inquiry.
Whittle says miners and contractors need to invest in site facilities and health and safety practices, particularly at smaller camps. He said sexual harassment needs to be seen as a systemic issue, rather than a series of unrelated incidents for the police to deal with.
""Often these (smaller) camps are poorly managed, the facilities are very poor. You might have little more than a wet mess and a rundown gym in terms of recreation facilities on site,"" he said, referring to mess facilities that serve alcohol.
""We need to put a duty on the camp operators and the miners and all the resource companies to...prevent harm in these workplaces.""
In a 2020 report, the Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry into sexual harassment found that 74% of women in the mining industry had experienced some form of sexual harassment in the past five years, partly due to the gender imbalance.
CULTURAL ISSUES
A young woman formerly employed at one of Australia’s largest mining companies told Reuters that while her team was ""welcoming, sensitive and conscious,"" that attitude was not always replicated underground.
""If you are a new employee and there are already about 8-10 male miners down there, you tend to sort of accept a few things here or there that you usually wouldn't,"" said the woman, who declined to be named. ""Like swearing, or throwing the c-word around like it's nothing.""
In her experience her male colleagues were largely respectful to her but she said when there is a group of them that ""culture perpetuates.""
Australia's three biggest miners, BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue, did not have an immediate response to requests for further comment but have previously spoken about measures they are taking to address the issues, including efforts to increase women in their workforces.
BHP has been targeting a 50-50 gender split by 2025. The percentage of women has risen to 26.5% up from 17.6% since mid-2016.
Rio is striving to increase the representation of women by 2 percentage points each year. It rose by 0.9% to 21.0% in the first half, hiring 1,270 women, 32% of all hires. It has also launched an initiative to address sexual harassment and help it retain women.
""As an industry, we must and can do more to ensure we have a diverse workforce that is reflective of our community and foster a workplace culture that truly embraces diversity and inclusiveness,"" Elizabeth Gaines, Fortescue Chief Executive, said last week.

At the mining industry's biggest annual conference in the outback town of Kalgoorlie last week, Gaines noted she had improved the event's gender diversity: women made up four out of 56 speakers, up from the three last year.
""It is clear that the industry still has some work to do in this regard,"" she said at the conference.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Top oilfield services firm Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) on Thursday said it had withdrawn staff from next week's Offshore Technology Conference (OTC), which typically attracts at least 60,000 attendees to Houston, citing the area's rise in COVID-19 cases.
The annual exhibition and technical exchange for offshore energy equipment and service companies historically ranks among the 10 largest trade shows by attendance, attracting exhibitors and energy professionals from around the world. 
Last year's conference was canceled due to the pandemic and this year's event was pushed back from its usual spring schedule because of COVID-19. It will include in-person and broadcast programs. 
""As the Houston area hospitalization rates increase rapidly, Schlumberger has taken the decision to withdraw from the Offshore Technology Conference,"" spokeswoman Moira Duff said. The company is developing virtual presentations for the event, she added. 
Houston has been hit by a surge in the Delta variant, with some 3,422 people testing positive on Wednesday, from just 398 new cases a month ago. Harris County, which includes Houston, last week raised its alert level to its highest and asked unvaccinated residents to stay home. 
The city's hospital complex, Texas Medical Center, this week said its Phase 1 intensive care units were full and a combination of Phase 1 and 2 two beds, which include additional ICU capacity, were 85% full as of Wednesday.
An OTC spokeswoman did not have an immediate response to Schlumberger's withdrawal. The program this year includes extensive safety measures in the conference hall and was designed to allow for in-person or online attendance, she said. 

Other companies, including engineering and construction firm McDermott International, have reduced staffing and lowered their expectations for attendance. While the trade show drew 59,200 people two years ago, the number is likely to be down significantly this year.

126,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 10:50PM ET</span>",Kansas City Southern may delay Canadian National deal vote,"(Reuters) - Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) said on Thursday it has turned down a $27 billion bid from  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway and will delay a shareholder vote on a $29 billion deal to sell itself to Canadian National Railway Co if the rail regulator does not rule on the deal in the next five days.
Kansas City Southern shareholders are due to vote on the deal with Canadian National in seven days, on Aug. 19, but the Surface Transportation Board (STB) has yet to rule on the proposed ""voting trust"" structure of the transaction. 
A voting trust insulates the acquisition target from the acquirer's control until the STB clears the deal on a permanent basis.
The STB said earlier this week it would deliver its decision on the Canadian National deal by Aug. 31. Kansas City Southern said on Thursday that if the STB has not delivered its decision by Aug. 17, it would delay the vote so shareholders can review it. The new date for the vote will be determined later, it said.
The acquisition of Kansas City Southern by either of its Canadian peers would create the first direct railway linking Canada, the United States and Mexico.
Canadian National has said it will divest Kansas City Southern's 70-mile (115 km) rail line between New Orleans and Baton Rouge to eliminate overlap between the two railroad operators. It has agreed to pay a $1 billion fee to Kansas City Southern should regulators shoot down their deal.
Canadian Pacific argues that Canadian National and Kansas City Southern compete for the business of shippers and terminals in the same region, which would lose out should the merger go through. It also points out that the STB has greenlighted its voting trust structure for a deal with Kansas City Southern.
Canadian Pacific presented the $27 billion offer for Kansas City Southern on Tuesday, hoping the antitrust concerns would give it an edge. It had said it would allow Kansas City Southern's board to receive the STB decision before opining on it.
Kansas City Southern, however, took two days to review the bid with its financial and legal advisors, and said it found it not superior to the Canadian National deal.

Despite the rejection, Canadian Pacific said on Thursday it applauded the Kansas City Southern board decision to adjourn the shareholder vote absent a ruling from the STB. 
Canadian National said in a statement it also supported Kansas City Southern's decision to potentially delay the shareholder vote.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, as the latest regulatory tightening in China and the spread of COVID-19's Delta variant globally sour investor sentiment.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.07% by 10:02 PM ET (2:02 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.23%. China expanded its regulation tightening exercise to the real estate sectors, with private equity funds suspended from raising money to invest in residential property development.

Stagflation occurs when economic growth slows at the same time inflation levels rise. Currently, there are concerns that economic growth will be negatively affected by the increase in coronavirus cases and inflation is rising at its fastest pace since 2008.
This would be disastrous for consumers and businesses and would lead to underperformance of stock prices. The last time the US encountered stagflation was in the 1970s, when inflation was elevated due to the Arab oil embargo, the Bretton-Woods agreement which severed the connection between the dollar and gold, and an increase in fiscal deficits due to the expansion of the welfare state and the Vietnam War. 
There are some parallels from the period of stagnation during the 1970s to the economic conditions we’re seeing today: the Fed is still aggressively injecting liquidity into markets, we’re seeing record fiscal deficits, and we face the continued challenge in dealing with the coronavirus.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 09:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Apple's child protection features spark concern within its own ranks -sources,"By Joseph Menn and Julia Love
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A backlash over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s move to scan U.S. customer phones and computers https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/apple-not-pass-icloud-photo-uploads-law-enforcement-if-they-do-not-contain-child-2021-08-06 for child sex abuse images has grown to include employees speaking out internally, a notable turn in a company famed for its secretive culture, as well as provoking intensified protests from leading technology policy groups.
Apple employees have flooded an Apple internal Slack channel with more than 800 messages on the plan announced a week ago, workers who asked not to be identified told Reuters. Many expressed worries that the feature could be exploited by repressive governments looking to find other material for censorship or arrests, according to workers who saw the days-long thread.
Past security changes at Apple have also prompted concern among employees, but the volume and duration of the new debate is surprising, the workers said. Some posters worried that Apple is damaging its leading reputation for protecting privacy.
Though coming mainly from employees outside of lead security and privacy roles, the pushback marks a shift for a company where a strict code of secrecy around new products colors other aspects of the corporate culture.
Slack rolled out a few years ago and has been more widely adopted by teams at Apple during the pandemic, two employees said. As workers used the app to maintain social ties during the work-from-home era by sharing recipes and other light-hearted content, more serious discussions have also taken root. 
In the Slack thread devoted to the photo-scanning feature, some employees have pushed back against criticism, while others said Slack wasn't the proper forum for such discussions.
Core security employees did not appear to be major complainants in the posts, and some of them said that they thought Apple's solution was a reasonable response to pressure to crack down on illegal material.
Other employees said they hoped that the scanning is a step toward fully encrypting iCloud for customers who want it, which would reverse Apple's direction on the issue a second time.
PROTEST
Last week's announcement is drawing heavier criticism from past outside supporters who say Apple is rejecting a history of well-marketed privacy fights.
They say that while the U.S. government can't legally scan wide swaths of household equipment for contraband or make others do so, Apple is doing it voluntarily, with potentially dire consequences.
People familiar with the matter said a coalition of policy groups are finalizing a letter of protest to send to Apple within days demanding a suspension of the plan. Two groups, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) both released newly detailed objections to Apple's plan in the past 24 hours.
""What Apple is showing with their announcement last week is that there are technical weaknesses that they are willing to build in,"" CDT project director Emma Llanso said in an interview. ""It seems so out of step from everything that they had previously been saying and doing.""
Apple declined to comment for this story. It has said it will refuse requests from governments to use the system to check phones for anything other than illegal child sexual abuse material. 
Outsiders and employees pointed to Apple's stand against the FBI in 2016, when it successfully fought a court order to develop a new tool to crack into a terrorism suspect's iPhone. Back then, the company said that such a tool would inevitably be used to break into other devices for other reasons.
But Apple was surprised its stance then was not more popular, and the global tide since then has been toward more monitoring of private communication. 
With less publicity, Apple has made other technical decisions that help authorities, including dropping a plan https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT to encrypt widely used iCloud backups and agreeing to store Chinese user data in that country.
A fundamental problem with Apple's new plan on scanning child abuse images, critics said, is that the company is making cautious policy decisions that it can be forced to change, now that the capability is there, in exactly the same way it warned would happen if it broke into the terrorism suspect's phone.
Apple says it will scan only in the United States and other countries to be added one by one, only when images are set to be uploaded to iCloud, and only for images that have been identified by the National Center for Exploited and Missing Children and a small number of other groups.
But any country's legislature or courts could demand that any one of those elements be expanded, and some of those nations, such as China, represent enormous and hard to refuse markets, critics said.
Police and other agencies will cite recent laws requiring ""technical assistance"" in investigating crimes, including in the United Kingdom and Australia, to press Apple to expand this new capability, the EFF said.

""The infrastructure needed to roll out Apple’s proposed changes makes it harder to say that additional surveillance is not technically feasible,"" wrote EFF General Counsel Kurt Opsahl.
Lawmakers will build on it as well, said Neil Brown, a U.K. tech lawyer at decoded.legal: ""If Apple demonstrates that, even in just one market, it can carry out on-device content filtering, I would expect regulators/lawmakers to consider it appropriate to demand its use in their own markets, and potentially for an expanded scope of things.""

Earlier this month, Boeing (NYSE:BA) scrubbed the launch of its much awaited CST-100 Starliner to the International Space Station after discovering a glitch in its propulsion system valves during pre-launch checks.
Boeing declined to comment on the WSJ report when contacted by Reuters.
The delay in CST-100 Starliner's launch is the latest setback for a U.S. aerospace giant reeling from back-to-back crises - a pandemic that crushed demand for new jetliners and a safety scandal caused by two fatal 737 MAX crashes - that have damaged Boeing's finances and engineering reputation.
The uncrewed test flight's delay also throws into question the timing of its follow-on mission with a crew onboard, which Boeing has said would take place no earlier than December.
Separately, Boeing said late on Thursday it fixed nine of its 13 CST-100 Starliner propulsion system valves and the remaining four still remained closed.
The announcement comes after Boeing said earlier this week it was assessing multiple dates for the launch of its space capsule.

Boeing also said it was working with NASA and United Launch Alliance to confirm launch dates when the spacecraft is ready.
The CST-100 Starliner will take people to and from a low-earth orbit. Boeing is competing with Elon Musk's SpaceX to take NASA astronauts to the space station from the United States.

131,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 08:00PM ET</span>",Thailand’s Oil Giant Is Going on a Green Spending Spree,"(Bloomberg) -- Thailand’s oil giant, whose sales account for about 10% of the nation’s economic output, is suddenly spending billions of dollars on electric-vehicle and renewable-energy companies and tilting its traditional businesses toward chemicals and plastics.
PTT Pcl announced investments of almost $10 billion since May to build an EV business and snap up petrochemical assets in Europe and renewable-energy projects in Asia. And the group isn’t done yet.
“The company must transform its strategy and vision for sustainable growth with an increased environmental awareness,” said Arawadee Photisaro, PTT’s senior executive vice president for corporate strategy. “Climate change will force more urgent policies and measures for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which will hurt demand for fossil fuels.”
Tasked with tackling the global oil shortage in the 1970s, state-controlled PTT reigned as Thailand’s biggest company for decades. Now, it’s chasing renewable-energy assets in India and Vietnam and electricity generation in Europe, to add to $7.7 billion of investments announced in July by its chemical, power and refining units. They followed an offer in May of as much as $2 billion for a Thai EV partnership, PTT’s first major investment in the industry.
It’s the first time the downstream businesses have made major acquisitions overseas and the total so far in 2021 already exceeds the group’s record for international purchases in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Previously, PTT’s major foreign spending was through PTT Exploration (OTC:PEXNY) & Production Pcl, which built up stakes in oil and gas fields stretching from Canada to Mozambique and Australia.
More acquisitions in “future and clean energy” are coming, both in Thailand and abroad, including in renewables, energy storage, power trading and EVs, Arawadee said.
PTT and its units are joining the ranks of major global oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, Total SA (NYSE:TTE) and Eni SpA that are ramping up investment in clean energy as investor pressure mounts to ditch traditional fossil-fuel businesses. The European Union and the U.S. have set 2050 as the date by which they must be carbon neutral, while President Joe Biden set a goal for half of all cars sold in the U.S. to be battery-electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell-powered by 2030.
“There is a change in the group’s growth appetite,” said Pauline Tang, an associate director at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings in Singapore. Diversifying into overseas downstream petrochemical products and renewable energy will insulate the company from the volatility in oil prices and demand over the next decade, she said.
In the July acquisition splurge, power unit Global Power Synergy Pcl revealed investments totaling about $950 million in a renewable energy company in India and a wind power project in Taiwan; refiner Thai Oil Pcl said it will buy a $1.18 billion stake in Indonesia’s PT Chandra Asri Petrochemical; and PTT Global Chemical Pcl said it would acquire European specialty chemical maker Allnex Holding GmbH for $4.75 billion.
Plastics Future
Recyclable plastics are seen as one way oil refiners can continue to make money from petrochemicals and PTT Global agreed in 2019 to set up a joint venture in Thailand with a manufacturer of recyclable plastic resins. On Wednesday, PTT announced a 56% jump in second-quarter sales from a year earlier, partly thanks to higher petrochemical prices.
As a state-owned enterprise, the group is influenced by the Thai government’s bio-circular-green economic model, which involves producing renewable biological resources, reusing and recycling, and balancing economic and environmental needs.
“Clean energy investments are unlikely to generate any great returns, but PTT needs to follow this global trend,” said Naphat Chantaraserekul, an analyst at Krungsri Securities Pcl in Bangkok. “Investors’ big concern is PTT’s poor track record in foreign countries, from oil sands in Canada, a palm plantation in Indonesia and an oil field in Australia.”
While the sharp uptick in investments may pressure PTT’s balance-sheet liquidity in 2021, PTT’s strong cash position and good access to capital markets would help it financing the acquisitions, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mary Ellen Olson and Sheenu Gupta.
Even as the group expands earnings outside the oil industry, PTT Exploration will still pursue overseas acquisitions, Senior Vice President Orachon Ouiyamapun told investors earlier this month. According to a presentation to investors, half of the $28 billion capital expenditure committed for 2021-25 will go to the oil and gas production unit.
As recently as February, PTT Exploration announced the purchase of 20% stake in an Omani gas block from BP (NYSE:BP) Plc for $2.6 billion. Last December, it secured a license to explore off the coast of Abu Dhabi in neighboring United Arab Emirates.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Paytm's $2.2 billion IPO is facing an unusual hurdle - a 71-year-old former director has urged India's markets regulator to stall the offering, alleging he is a co-founder who invested $27,500 two decades ago but never got shares.
In legal documents seen by Reuters, Paytm says the claim by Ashok Kumar Saxena and allegations of fraud in a police complaint in New Delhi are mischievous attempts to harass the firm. The dispute though is cited under ""criminal proceedings"" in Paytm's July IPO prospectus filed for regulatory approval.
Saxena denied harassment and said Paytm had a high profile position that meant a private individual like him was not in a position to harass the company. 
Saxena has approached the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to stall the IPO, arguing investors could lose money if his claim is proved right, according to a previously unreported complaint seen by Reuters.
SEBI did not respond to a request for comment.
Shriram Subramanian of shareholder advisory firm InGovern said the tussle could spark regulatory inquiries and complicate or delay the approval of Paytm's IPO that could value it at up to $25 billion.
""SEBI will need assurance that it will not impact the company and the public shareholders once listed,"" Subramanian said.
Irrespective of what the regulator decides, the dispute could become a legal headache ahead of the much-awaited IPO of Paytm, which counts China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Japan's SoftBank among its investors. Neither responded to a request for comment.
At the heart of the dispute is a one-page document signed between Saxena and Paytm's billionaire CEO, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, in 2001. Seen by Reuters, it says Saxena was to get a 55% equity stake in Paytm's parent, One97 Communications, with Sharma owning the rest.
Paytm declined to comment. Sharma did not respond to a request for comment.
POLICE SUBMISSION 
Reuters reviewed a June 29 response the company gave to the Delhi Police, where it says the document was ""merely a letter of intent"" which ""did not materialize into any definitive agreement"".
The ""Agreement Between Shareholders of One97"" paper, was also reproduced by Paytm before police and signed by the two men, shows Paytm's police submission which is not public.
Paytm's police filing denies Saxena was a co-founder.
Paytm's rise has been phenomenal, with its app a household name in India for digital payments. The face of the company has been flamboyant CEO Sharma, 43, whose app rivals those run by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
Paytm's incorporation documents in the government database show Saxena as a director of the company between 2000 and 2004. In its police response, Paytm agrees he was among the first directors of the company's parent and extended the funds to it. But he ""gradually seemed to lose interest"", Paytm says.
Around 2003-2004, Paytm argues it had transferred the shares to an Indian firm as it was ""informed"" that Saxena had reached a private understanding with them. Saxena said he never received any shares and there was no such understanding.
Asked why he had been silent for several years, he told Reuters by telephone from the United States that he had medical issues in his family and had misplaced key documents which he only found last summer. 
""The shares and money are one thing, but I also want to be recognized as the co-founder,"" he said. ""It's a question of posterity."" 

The matter has reached a New Delhi court, where Saxena in July urged a judge to press the city police to register a case on his complaint. The court order shows police have been asked to respond and the case will be heard on Aug. 23. 
A Delhi Police official said on Thursday they would make the necessary submissions to the court.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A Canadian judge on Thursday appeared skeptical of arguments made by prosecutors, questioning the validity of the case in the United States against Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who is facing possible extradition on several charges.
Committal hearings in Meng's case are expected to finish next week, as two years of legal wrangling come to a close.
The Canadian government's case, as laid out in the record of the case provided by the United States as justification for her arrest and extradition, is that Meng lied to HSBC about Huawei's ownership of an Iran-based subsidiary called Skycom, causing the bank to commit fraud and unknowingly break U.S. sanctions.
Meng's defense lawyers have argued that HSBC was not misled, and was in fact fully aware that Skycom - a business which Reuters reported was breaking U.S. sanction laws against Iran - was a subsidiary of Huawei, rather than a local partner as had been previously stated.
Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes at times appeared skeptical of the validity of the United States' claim.
""Isn't it unusual that one would see a fraud case with no actual harm, many years later, and one in which the alleged victim - a large institution - appears to have numerous people within the institution who had all the facts that are now said to have been misrepresented?"" Holmes asked.
""The law is quite clear about that,"" Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater responded. ""You yourself said that people within the institution may know, they may even be participants. It doesn't mean there is no fraud.""
Holmes then said: ""I'm simply suggesting that it may be unusual to have both of those features - no actual loss, and arguably, fairly extensive knowledge within the institution about the true state of affairs.""
Frater said this was an issue for sentencing.
Meng was arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 on a U.S. warrant, for allegedly misleading HSBC bank about Huawei's business dealings in Iran and potentially causing it to break U.S. economic sanctions against Tehran.
She has claimed innocence and is fighting the extradition. Her lawyers will begin making their final arguments in her favor on Friday, and are expected to finish next week.

Hearings are set to wrap up next week and Holmes will likely issue an order on whether or not to extradite in the autumn, before Canadian Justice Minister David Lametti makes the final call.
Both Holmes' and Lametti's decisions can be appealed, which legal experts say means the case could drag on for years.

The biotech and pharma industry thrived amid the COVID-19 pandemic due to substantial capital investments to develop vaccines and therapies for the virus. The industry is expected to remain in focus in the coming months because of the rapid spread of the virus’ Delta variant in several parts of the world. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global biotechnology market is expected to expand at a 15.83% CAGR from 2021 - 2028.

As concerns over the oil industry recovery grow, we think energy stocks  EQT Corporation  (NYSE:EQT), Tellurian (NASDAQ:TELL), and Delek. (DK) possess bleak growth prospects and as such are best avoided now. Read on.Oil demand rose significantly in the first half of 2021 thanks to a fast-paced economic reopening. Rising demand and production cuts drove oil prices to their near two-and-a-half years’ highs.
However, the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant is now threatening to cool the oil demand. As several countries reinstate travel restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, oil demand will likely remain tepid in the near term. Meanwhile, earlier this month, OPEC+ closed a deal to increase oil supply gradually, aiming to fully phase out production cuts by around September 2022. So, with depressed demand and a supply glut, oil prices are expected to decline further in the coming months.

The FTC and Justice Department, which share the work of antitrust enforcement, will often have merging companies sell assets or agree to certain practices in order to address competition concerns so that planned deals may to go forward. The FTC, to which Khan was recently appointed as chair, tends to review defense industry deals.
Responding to a letter from Warren about concerns over defense mergers, Khan said studies have shown that divestitures often fell short. ""In light of this, I believe the antitrust agencies should more frequently consider opposing problematic deals outright,"" she said in the letter dated August 6.
She was similarly skeptical of behavioral remedies, saying ""behavioral remedies pose significant administrability problems and have often failed to prevent the merged entity from engaging in anticompetitive tactics.""
Warren had previously asked the FTC to take a tougher look at defense industry mergers, questioning a proposal from  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) that would allow it to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD), the biggest independent maker of rocket motors.
Shares of Aerojet fell more than 4% in afternoon trading once Khan's letter was made public. 
Warren had asked the FTC in particular to examine the efficacy of firewalls like those Lockheed proposes to prevent it from gaining a competitive advantage over peers once the deal closes, according to a July 16 letter whose contents were first published by Reuters.
The $4.4 billion deal has raised eyebrows because Lockheed would take over a company that produces 70% of the solid fuel rocket motors and other propulsion products used in everything from antiballistic missiles to air-to-air missiles.

The chief executive of one of Aerojet's biggest customers, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp, said his company would speak with antitrust regulators because of their ""concerns"" about the deal.

Tesla also said it was willing to intensify communication in the site, Steinbach said after a meeting with Musk on Wednesday.
Tesla has pushed back the expected opening of the gigafactory near Berlin to late 2021, blaming German bureaucratic hurdles.
The plant has also faced local public resistance due to environmental concerns.

Harris said Build Back Better, Biden's agenda for the U.S. economy's post-pandemic recovery, was aimed at lowering costs for families, helping businesses and strengthening the economy, while addressing longstanding ""fissures and failures"" in American society. 
Economists estimate that lack of access to family-friendly policies, such as child care and paid parental leave, explains nearly a third of the decline in U.S. women’s labor force participation relative to other OECD countries. 
Nearly 2 million women left the labor force during the COVID-19 pandemic to care for children and elderly relatives, and many have not yet returned to work. 
On Wednesday, Biden met with business and education leaders including the heads of United Airlines and healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente to discuss efforts to address ways to get more people vaccinated against COVID-19. 
The coronavirus has upended the economy and killed more than 617,000 people nationwide. 
Businesses have in general struggled to hire workers during the pandemic for various reasons, though unemployment has fallen after spiking last year amid widespread shutdowns. 

After passing a $1.9 trillion coronavirus-related rescue plan into law in March, Democrats are now pushing the $3.5 trillion measure, which includes $726 billion for universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds and child care for working families, and aids caregivers of the elderly and disabled. 
""When workers don’t have adequate care for their families, that can translate to lower productivity, increased absenteeism, and higher turnover – all hurting the bottom line for businesses,"" a White House official said, adding that a separate coalition of more than 275 businesses had backed the child care proposal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets hit record highs on Thursday while the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields edged higher, building on recent strength, as the debate continued over when the Federal Reserve will start to ease stimulus. 
Data on Wednesday hinted that U.S. inflation may have peaked, reassuring investors that the Federal Reserve will not feel obligated to hasten plans to rein in emergency-level support of the economy.
However, data on Thursday showed U.S. producer prices registered their largest increase in more than a decade.
Overall, investors appeared to believe the possibility of near-term tapering was receding.
""There continue to be indications that this spike in inflation is temporary. I don't think we're in a period where we're anywhere close to a Fed taper,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, which manages $4 billion in assets. 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe set a record high, gained 0.10%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed at record highs for the third consecutive day. 
The Dow rose 14.88 points, or 0.04%, to 35,499.85, the S&P 500 gained 13.13 points, or 0.30%, to 4,460.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 51.13 points, or 0.35%, to 14,816.26.
European stocks equaled their longest winning streak since 2017, closing up 0.1% and extending gains for a ninth consecutive session.
The dollar advanced again, after hitting its highest since April 1 on Wednesday.
The dollar index rose 0.114%, with the euro down 0.03% to $1.1733.
U.S. Treasury yields ticked slightly higher, building on recent gains, after a 30-year bond auction failed to give the market any convincing direction.
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 1.3624%, from 1.359% late on Wednesday.
Gold prices held slightly above the key $1,750 mark as expectations of an early taper of the Federal Reserve's asset purchases eased, offsetting a firmer dollar and yields.
Spot gold was flat at $1,751.99 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 0.1% down at $1,751.80.
BEARS IN THE CHINA SHOP
Asian shares dropped again overnight, dragged down by a 0.8% fall in Chinese blue chips and a 0.5% drop in Hong Kong as weaker-than-expected China lending data triggered liquidity concerns. 
Among the biggest sliders was Chinese online insurer ZhongAn, which fell 11.5% after state media said China's banking and insurance regulator would step up scrutiny of online insurance companies.
Nervous traders have been quick to respond to remarks from Chinese state media and officials, after many were surprised by last month's tougher-than-expected new rules for the private tutoring sector, one of several regulatory crack-downs that have roiled sectors from technology to property. 
Whereas the all-world stock index has been hitting regular record highs, MSCI's main Asian benchmark is now down more than 10% from its February peak. Some Chinese stocks have lost nearly 90%.
""The money is just in the U.S. and European markets right now, and that's our preferred market too,"" said Daniel Lam, senior cross-asset strategist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Wealth Management. 

Oil prices fell after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus would slow the recovery in global oil demand.
U.S. crude oil futures settled at $69.09 per barrel, down 16 cents or 0.2%. Brent crude futures settled at $71.31 per barrel, down 13 cents or 0.2%.

This risk-off mood was also manifested in plunging long-term yields, underperformance in cyclical stocks, and some profit-taking in overextended stocks and sectors. Fortunately, this headwind has tamped down, enabling some of our growth stocks to really shine. It’s not like small and mid-cap stocks have started outperforming as we would ideally like to see…but they’re no longer underperforming in the concerning way that they were for the last few weeks. I believe the major catalyst has been earnings season as small-caps and mid-caps have outperformed expectations. In this week’s commentary, I will do a recap of earnings season.

Analysts, however, have said that the current production agreement struck by OPEC and its allies will keep the oil market balanced.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is working with vaccine makers  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc to allow certain vulnerable people to receive a third booster shot of their COVID-19 vaccines to improve their immune response, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday.
Speaking at a White House COVID-19 press briefing, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the shots would be available to certain people who are moderately and severely immune compromised, such as people who have had organ transplants and some cancer patients. She estimated the group of vulnerable people was less than 3% of adults.
""This action is about ensuring our most vulnerable, who may need an additional dose to enhance their biological responses to the vaccines are better protected against COVID-19,"" Walensky said.
The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet on Friday to discuss this issue and offer recommendations.
Top U.S. infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci said U.S. officials do not believe elderly or others who are not immunocompromised need another vaccine dose at this moment.
Still, he said the government was evaluating the necessity of booster shots on a day-by-day basis.
""It's a true statement that we believe sooner or later you will need a booster for durability of protection,"" Fauci said.

Cases and hospitalizations have surged across the country in the past month. Some hospitals in Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi have run out of beds, and the outbreak is spreading beyond the epicenter in the U.S. South to Oregon and Washington state.
Some other countries, such as Israel and Germany, plan to or have already administered third shots to elderly or vulnerable people to try to slow the spread of the contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus.

(Reuters) - A McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) franchise in Oakland, California, has agreed to take steps to protect workers from COVID-19 to settle a 2020 lawsuit claiming managers gave employees dog diapers and coffee filters to use as face masks.
The franchise said in the settlement announced on Thursday that it would provide employees with paid sick leave, masks and gloves, maintain social distancing, regularly disinfect surfaces and require workers with COVID-19 symptoms to stay home. 
The franchise will also establish a worker safety committee, requiring the owner and managers to meet monthly with employees to discuss ways to maintain a safe workplace.
Fight for $15 and a Union, a labor organizing group that is involved in the lawsuit, said the safety committee was the first of its kind and would create a national model for giving more leverage to workers. 
The company denied wrongdoing, and it was not clear if the settlement included a financial component. 
The settlement comes amid a surge in COVID-19 cases in the United States due to the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant. An increasing number of companies are requiring workers to be vaccinated, or considering doing so, in response to the increase. 
McDonald's on Wednesday said it will require its U.S.-based office workers to be vaccinated.
Michael Smith, the Oakland franchise's operator, said in a statement that the restaurant began implementing the measures outlined in the settlement more than a year ago.
""We will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure that our stores remain as safe as possible,"" Smith said.
Last week, McDonald's agreed to implement various protective measures at a corporate-owned restaurant in Chicago to settle a lawsuit claiming the company had created a ""public nuisance"" by failing to take steps to protect workers. 
McDonald's denied wrongdoing in that case. The company has said that it has implemented dozens of safety measures at U.S. restaurants and required franchises to do the same.

In a statement on Thursday, McDonald's said it was ""confident that any outlier conduct like that alleged in these complaints does not reflect what has broadly happened and continues to happen across 14,000 U.S. McDonald’s locations.""
""We’ve worked closely with leading public health authorities, with global suppliers, and with the Mayo Clinic to enhance over 50 safety procedures in restaurants and have sourced over 111 million pieces of personal protective equipment to support crew safety,"" the company said.

(Reuters) -Cineworld is considering a Wall Street listing for all or part of its business in an effort to bolster its finances which are under heavy pressure from the coronavirus pandemic.
A U.S. listing would give heavily indebted Cineworld access to the largest capital market in the world, where rival U.S. cinema group AMC this year became one of the so-called ""meme stocks"", sending its shares skyrocketing.
Shares in Cineworld, which gets the bulk of its revenue from its Regal cinemas in the United States, jumped 8% by 0833 GMT on the FTSE midcap index.
""We believe this is quite an interesting consideration which could be supportive of valuation if we were to see similar support in Regal as was with AMC,"" BofA analysts wrote.
The company, which had net debt of $8.44 billion as of the end of June, said cash burn was $271 million in the first six months of the year, while losses narrowed to $576.4 million from $1.64 billion last year thanks to tighter cost control.
Rival AMC, the world's biggest cinema theatre group, has also reported a big quarterly loss, saying ticket sales were running at less than one-third of 2019 levels. 
NEW RELEASES
People have flocked back to cinemas in the past few months to watch movies such as Marvel's ""Black Widow"" and Paramount thriller ""A Quiet Place 2"".
Cineworld boss Mooky Greidinger expressed confidence in a line-up of big releases ahead, including four new Marvel movies and Tom Cruise's ""Top Gun Maverick"", the new James Bond movie, ""The Matrix 4"" and science fiction film ""Dune"". 
All of Cineworld's 787 sites were open as of June, with Greidinger saying ticket sales were now at more than 50% of pre-crisis levels, as the United States and the UK eased months of pandemic curbs after vaccination drives picked up pace. 
But concerns over new variants of the virus and an accelerated shift by studios to release movies simultaneously on streaming platforms are still a cause for concern. 

Cineworld said it was expecting the window for movie releases in theatres to stabilise to somewhere between 20 and 60 days by next year. 
""One of the most significant things that we all learned from the short window is that it creates an opportunity for high-quality pirated copies which is going all over the world,"" Greidinger said.

Taylor Dart explains why both stocks are setting up for a second-half rally.It's been an impressive year thus far for the Nasdaq Composite (QQQ), with the index up more than 15% year-to-date, knocking on the door of the 15,000 level. This strong performance in the face of multi-year high inflation readings and fears surrounding a 4th COVID-19 wave is even more impressive, but it's made it very difficult to find any bargains in the market. In fact, we have more than 60 growth stocks now trading at above 35x sales, the highest reading since this bull market began a decade ago. However, while most names look very expensive, two names look like solid buy-the-dip candidates. In this update, we'll look at these two names and assess their ideal buy-points.
(Source: TC2000.com)
While high-flyers like HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) and Bill.com (BILL) are up more than 50% year-to-date, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Netflix (NFLX) have been unable to keep up with the S&P-500 this year, up 15% and down 5%, respectively. This underperformance has left these stocks trading at more reasonable valuations than many of their peers, with NFLX looking much more undervalued in a rare period where it actually has a negative 12-month return. This is even though NFLX is on track to grow annual earnings per share by more than 65% in FY2021 alone. In AMD's case, annual EPS growth is accelerating after a massive year in FY2020, with FY2021 annual EPS growth projected at 104%, up from 87% growth last year. While not as cheap as Netflix, AMD is also reasonably valued, assuming if it can meet its FY2023 earnings targets. Let's take a closer look at both companies below:

Many U.S. airline operators expect the virus’ Delta variant to undermine the industry’s recovery prospects through the fall. Thus, the shares of well-known airline carriers Delta (DAL) and  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) are expected to remain under pressure. But let’s discuss if either of these stocks is a buy at its current price level considering the industry’s long-term growth prospects. Read on.Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) in Atlanta, Ga., and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK) in Seattle, Wash., are two popular airline operators in the United States. DAL provides scheduled air transportation for passengers, freight, and mail over a network of routes worldwide. It offers flight status information, bookings, baggage handling, and other related services. In comparison, ALK provides passenger and cargo air transportation services. The company operates through Mainline; Regional; and Horizon segments.
Although 50.3% of the U.S.’ vaccination eligible population is now fully vaccinated for COVID-19, the demand for leisure travel, which increased earlier this summer, has started to decline with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant. In fact, many airline operators expect the resurgence of COVID-19 to darken the industry’s recovery prospects through the fall. So, both DAL and ALK could witness a decline in passengers in the coming months.
While DAL’s stock has gained 17.9% in price over the past nine months, ALK has surged 34.1%. ALK is also a clear winner with 52.5% gains versus DAL’s 39.3% in the past year’s performance. But, given the industry's near-term prospects, are either of these stocks worth buying now? Let’s see how they compare in terms of financials and growth prospects.

""It remains to be seen whether OPEC+ will comply with the US wishes. In our opinion, the production hikes that have been announced are enough to keep the oil market largely balanced,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
The broader weakness in cyclicals could prove short lived as some on Wall Street forecast that the bottom is in for cyclicals, with gains expected ahead.

(Reuters) - JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp started transatlantic flights between New York and London on Wednesday, planning to grab market share with low fares and drive a recovery on what is usually one of the world's busiest and most lucrative international routes.
Transatlantic travel remains partially shut as the United States is still not allowing most travelers from Britain into the country because of the coronavirus pandemic. Anyone who does enter, including U.S. citizens, must present a negative COVID-19 test.
The UK only opened to fully vaccinated U.S. travelers earlier in August.
But New York-based JetBlue pressed ahead with the start of its daily John F. Kennedy (JFK) Airport to Heathrow service, counting on its new Airbus A321LR jets, a longer-range variant of the A321neo, to underpin profits.
Fares for JetBlue's Mint class, which features 24 lie-flat private suites, will start at $1,979 and 999 pounds, significantly cheaper than traditional prices by rivals, while round-trip economy tickets will start at $599 for U.S. travelers.
Speaking at JFK before the first departure, JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes said the launch was already driving a price war, with fares between New York and London falling since its flights went on sale.
""JetBlue is responsible for that,"" he said.
UK-based airlines British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are struggling in the pandemic because unlike U.S. rivals American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines, they do not have a large, buoyant domestic market to fall back on.

JetBlue, which plans to add flights to London's Gatwick in late September and between Boston and London next year, was more affected than other U.S. airlines during the pandemic because its hub airports were heavily affected by lockdowns.
As domestic COVID-19 restrictions ease, it has seen an increase in revenues. It hopes its London service will provide a further boost and that it will fare better than other low-cost carriers that have tried and failed to conquer the transatlantic in the past.

So, Wall Street analysts expect established beer stocks Anheuser-Busch (BUD),  Molson Coors  (NYSE:TAP), and The Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) to garner solid upside in the coming months. So, cheers! And please read on for details on these names.
Last year, the alcoholic beverage industry suffered a setback due to COVID-19 pandemic-led restrictions. Retail beer sales dipped, with several stadiums, concert venues, bars, and restaurants remaining closed. According to the Brewers Association, overall U.S. beer volume sales were down 3% in 2020.
However, as restaurants and bars continue to reopen, with several restrictions to limit the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus, the demand for beer is going up this year. And, according to a Business Wire report, the global beer market is expected to reach $710.89 billion by 2025.
So, we think it could be wise to add beer stocks Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD), Molson Coors Beverage Company (TAP), and The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM) to one’s watchlist. Wall Street analysts expect these stocks to rally by 20% or more in the near term.

So, we think investors that are looking to capitalize on the industry’s growth in a relatively less risky way could bet on popular EV charging ETFs—Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) and Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT). So, let’s take a closer look at these names.Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to eventually dominate the automotive market, thanks to favorable government policies worldwide amid the growing climate change concerns. As a result, the demand for EV charging solutions is also expected to rise significantly.
President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure plan includes significant spending for the EV charging industry. He would like to see 500,000 EV charging stations built by 2030. According to a Technavio report, the EV charging station market is expected to grow at a 31% CAGR between 2021 - 2025.
Because it’s challenging to select the best stock in the crowded EV charging space, investors looking to capitalize on the industry’s growth in a less risky way could bet on quality ETFs exposed to EV charging stocks. Examples are Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) and Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT), which are rated A (which translates to Strong Buy) in our proprietary POWR Ratings system. So, we think these ETFs are worth considering for one’s portfolio.

By Chibuike Oguh and Patturaja Murugaboopathy 
(Reuters) -The abundance of cheap corporate debt is pushing investors who typically buy the debt of U.S. companies in financial distress to invest instead in providing financing to companies that are shunned by banks and don't have any other way to borrow money.
Distressed debt investors snap up the debt of a company with the expectation that a potential bankruptcy would give them ownership of that company. The financial downturn brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic could have resulted in a tidal wave of such opportunities.
Instead, the U.S. government and Federal Reserve flooded the market with liquidity, from government assistance programs to buying financial assets. This added to cheap money that was already available thanks to the Fed's near-zero interest rates. 
Rajay Bagaria, president at Wasserstein Debt Opportunities, said distressed debt accounts for only 0.9% of the U.S. high yield bond universe currently, adding that there were very few opportunities in the sector. 
According to Fitch data, the trailing 12-month default rate of U.S. leveraged loans dropped to 1.4% at the end of July, the lowest in 25 months. 
Fitch expects the default rate to be at 1.5% at the end of this year.
""The old days of distressed debt where I buy something like at 60 or 70 cents on the dollar, take it through restructuring, put some more money into it and sell it for two to three times, that's not happening right now,"" said Mark Jenkins, head of global credit at  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc.
As a result, distressed debt investors have resorted to providing rescue financing to companies in badly-hit sectors such as real estate, airlines, and event management. They are also extending credit to companies looking to shore up their balance sheet in the face of growing consumer demand.
U.S. distressed debt funds raised $12.4 billion in the first seven months of this year, down 60% from $31.1 billion raised in the same period last year. Funds targeting direct lending investments raised $28 billion, up from $27 billion collected a year ago, according to financial data provider Preqin.
""Today's 'distress' has shifted into giving existing lenders the upper hand,"" said Chris Sheldon, head of leveraged credit at KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc, which raised a $2.8 billion ""dislocation opportunities"" fund at the height of the crisis last year.

More private equity firms are replacing banks as lenders to companies, especially those in the mid-market with up to $500 million in revenues. For now, distressed investors are hopeful government economic support programs will wear off soon, pushing companies to begin scrambling for financing to pay off outstanding debt with near-term maturities. 
""There are companies whose cashflow will not increase to the level that will allow them to refinance their debt. They really won't be able to hide,"" said Victor Khosla, founder and chief investment officer at Strategic Value Partners, a distressed-focused firm with more than $17 billion in assets under management.

(Reuters) -Cigarette maker Philip Morris won the support of Vectura for its 1.1 billion pound ($1.5 billion) takeover offer for the inhaled treatments maker after outbidding private equity firm Carlyle, the British company said on Thursday.
Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) (PMI) on Sunday sweetened its offer for the asthma drugmaker to 165 pence per share, surpassing Carlyle's final 155p proposal. 
Vectura said it considered the terms of the Philip Morris offer to be fair and reasonable and its board planned to unanimously recommend the bid to shareholders.
Vectura's backing for the Philip Morris deal comes despite the company previously noting the uncertainties that could arise as a result of it being owned by the Marlboro cigarette maker.
Philip Morris aims to use Vectura's expertise with inhalable formulations and device design to produce a range of over-the-counter and prescription-based respiratory therapies. 
Its interest also comes at a time when big tobacco has been trying to change its image following years of negative press and lawsuits for selling health-harming cigarettes.
PMI, which on Tuesday switched its proposal to a takeover offer from a so-called scheme of arrangement to up its chances, needs the acceptances of holders of just over 50% of Vectura shares for the deal to go through. 
There will be no shareholder meeting. Instead, the offer will be open for a minimum of 21 days, unless extended, and PMI needs to satisfy the acceptance condition in the next 60 days.
Carlyle had said last week Vectura shareholders AXA Investment Managers, TIG Advisors and Berry Street Capital indicated their support for the buyout firm's deal. They together hold a stake of about 11.2% in the drugmaker.
The bidding war between the two American suitors drew the intervention of Britain's takeover regulator on Monday to break the impasse.

London-listed shares of Vectura closed at 163.2 pence on Thursday. They have gained 33% since the first takeover proposal in May.

And because this trend will likely continue, we believe popular retail stocks Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG), Boot Barn Holdings (NYSE:BOOT), and Tilly’s (TLYS), which have returned more than 90% so far in 2021, should continue advancing. Let’s discuss.Following months of rising customer foot traffic in retail stores earlier this year, the re-imposition of mask mandates by the CDC amid rising COVID-19 cases will likely shift consumers’ focus back to online shopping. Nevertheless, with most retail companies establishing an online presence last year to remain operational, the latest COVID-19 spike is expected to have a limited impact on this industry.
Retail companies have been benefiting from robust consumer spending thanks to strong job growth. Former Macy’s CEO Terry Lundgren said that prevailing inflation rates should benefit the apparel industry after nearly a decade of stagnant growth.
Overall, retail stocks have been gaining momentum owing to strong consumer spending. This is evident in the SPDR S&P Retail ETF’s (XRT) 51.6% gains year-to-date, versus the broader SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 18.7% returns. Therefore, we think retail stocks  Signet Jewelers Limited  (SIG), Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (BOOT), and Tilly’s, Inc. (TLYS), which have gained more than 90% year-to-date, still have plenty of upsides to deliver..

The company had paused home acquisitions and actively sold through its inventory last year due to Covid-19.
The company announced its April-June results Wednesday, guiding revenue to come in between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion in the ongoing quarter. It sees third-quarter adjusted EBITDA in the $15 million to $25 million range.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Adidas is selling Reebok to Authentic Brands Group(ABG) for up to 2.1 billion euros ($2.5 billion) as the German sporting goods company concentrates on its core brand after a deal that did not deliver.
Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) bought Reebok for $3.8 billion in 2006 to help compete with arch-rival  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), but its sluggish performance prompted repeated calls from investors to sell the U.S. and Canada focused brand.
In the meantime, Adidas managed to eat into Nike's dominance in the United States with its own brand, helped by partnership with celebrities like Kanye West, Beyonce and Pharrell Williams.
Reebok will keep its headquarters in Boston and continue operations in North and Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Russia, the U.S. brand management firm said in a statement, adding it will work closely with Adidas during the transition.
Over 11 years, ABG has amassed more than 30 labels sold in some 6,000 stores. Its brands include apparel chains Aéropostale and Forever21, as well as and Sports Illustrated magazine.
""We've had our sights set on Reebok for many years, and we’re excited to finally bring this iconic brand into the fold,"" Jamie Salter, founder, chairman and CEO of ABG, said.
""We are committed to preserving Reebok’s integrity, innovation, and values - including its presence in bricks and mortar,"" he added.
Last month, ABG also filed for a U.S. initial public offering after a year of strong earnings growth.
FITNESS PLAN
After Kasper Rorsted took over as Adidas CEO in 2016, he launched a turnaround plan which helped Reebok return to profitability, but its performance continued to lag that of the core Adidas brand and it was then hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Adidas reported last week that Reebok's first-half sales jumped to 823 million euros from 600 million a year ago, and the brand made a net gain of 68 million euros compared to a net loss of 69 million in the first half of 2020.
Reebok's recent collaborations with celebrities like Cardi B and a renewed focus on women's apparel have put it in a better place, analysts say.
Adidas has already sold the Rockport, CCM Hockey and Greg Norman brands for 400 million euros, which were part of the original Reebok purchase.
The German company said in a statement that the sale had no impact on its financial outlook for the current year or for its targets set out in the five-year strategy it announced in March.
Adidas said the majority of the 2.1 billion euros would be paid in cash at the closing of the transaction, expected in the first quarter of 2022, with the remained comprised of a deferred and contingent consideration.

It said it would share the majority of the cash proceeds with its shareholders.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH), the largest U.S. health insurer, has settled federal and New York state charges it illegally denied coverage to thousands of patients suffering from mental health problems and substance abuse.
The U.S. Department of Labor said on Thursday that UnitedHealth will pay about $15.7 million, including $13.6 million in restitution and a $2.1 million fine, to settle with that agency and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
Authorities accused UnitedHealth of violating federal and state laws by imposing more restrictive limits on coverage and treatment for mental health and substance abuse disorders than it imposed for physical health conditions.
UnitedHealth was also accused of overcharging patients for out-of-network mental health services by reducing reimbursements.
Without admitting liability, UnitedHealth agreed to stop using algorithms, including in a program called ALERT, that required extra layers of review before continuing mental health treatment and often resulted in coverage being cut off.
Ensuring treatment for mental health and substance abuse is ""something I believe in strongly as a person in long-term recovery,"" Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, who was once an alcoholic, said in a statement.
UnitedHealth, based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, said in a statement it was pleased to settle, and no longer used the challenged practices, including ALERT.
It also said it was committed to providing care, including ""behavioral support,"" and reimbursement to policyholders consistent with federal and state rules.

James said more than 20,000 New Yorkers will receive $9 million from the settlement, and the state will receive $1.3 million of the fine.
She called access to mental health and substance abuse treatment ""more critical than ever before,"" citing the pandemic and rising overdose deaths.

So, we think these stocks could be good picks now. Read on.The consumer credit card industry has experienced a significant rebound this year, buoyed by improvements in macroeconomic factors, the easing of pandemic restrictions, and government stimulus spending. Because consumers are now more apt to spend, credit card companies have been investing heavily in digital marketing and enhanced digital payment facilities. Furthermore, the pandemic has boosted the growth of companies in the digital payment space, thanks to remote lifestyles and social distancing mandates.
As an improving market and government stimulus boosts consumer spending, credit card companies will likely benefit significantly. The rising need for consumer credit, accelerating technological innovation, and widespread use of digital prepaid card services should drive the growth of the credit card industry in the coming months. Actually, the global credit card industry is expected to reach $103.06 billion in 2021, growing at a 3% CAGR.

Investing.com – GoodRx stock (NASDAQ:GDRX) rose 5% Thursday as the company expanded its user base in the second quarter and topped revenue estimates.
The company closed the second quarter with a user base of more than 7.5 million that includes both its monthly active users and subscribers. It had closed the March quarter at over 7 million.
More active users using its app to buy prescription drugs at cheaper rates and subscribers helped boost revenue 43% year-on-year to $176.6 million.
According to the company, many consumers are still deferring physician visits due to Covid-19. That means therapies are being delayed as are new prescriptions.
Operating expenses more than doubled to $176.98 million and exceeded revenue. This was mostly due to higher spending on marketing and stock-based compensation.
An income tax benefit saved the company’s bottom line and helped it report a 14% growth in net income to $31.1 million.
The company has forecast revenue to come in between $193 million and $197 million and adjusted earnings margin to be 30%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp said on Thursday it swung back to profit in the first quarter, as sales of automotive chips and hard disk drives recover from a pandemic-driven slump in demand.
The scandal-hit Japanese conglomerate also said it has been working on the selection of candidates for a permanent CEO and board chairman.
Satoshi Tsunakawa, a veteran Toshiba executive who has taken on both positions in an interim capacity, told reporters he hopes an extraordinary shareholders meeting to appoint a new board chairman will be held by the end of this year. 
Toshiba posted an operating profit of 14.5 billion yen ($132 million) for April-June, in line with estimates and reversing a year-earlier loss of 12.6 billion yen. It was its fourth consecutive quarter of operating profit. Sales jumped 21%.
Its estimate of 170 billion yen in operating profit for the full year was unchanged.
An independent investigation in June concluded https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/independent-probe-says-toshiba-agm-last-year-was-not-fairly-managed-2021-06-10 Toshiba colluded with Japan's powerful trade ministry to block investors from gaining influence at last year's general meeting - an explosive finding that resulted in the ouster of its board chairman.
Toshiba's previous CEO left in April over controversy about a $20 billion buyout bid from CVC Capital Partners that the conglomerate dismissed, angering some shareholders. That in turn has prompted Toshiba to promise a strategic review.
Tsunakawa said Toshiba was working on the review and reiterated it was open to take-private bids although it has not received any other offers.

Toshiba plans to announce a new midterm business plan in October as it is still struggling to build new profit drivers after the sale of the prized memory chip unit and the bankruptcy of the U.S. nuclear business - both of which occurred in the wake of accounting scandals.

175,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 11:10AM ET</span>","Baidu quarterly results top estimates on ad sales, AI demand","(Reuters) -Baidu Inc's quarterly results topped Wall Street estimates on Thursday, as the Chinese search giant benefited from a rebound in advertising sales and higher demand for its artificial intelligence and cloud products. 
The company also said Chief Financial Officer Herman Yu has been appointed chief strategy officer, but will continue to serve as CFO until a successor is found. 
Demand for the company's rapidly growing autonomous driving service and artificial intelligence-powered cloud products, in which it has been investing heavily, has helped diversify revenue sources and offset competition from giants such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and ByteDance in its core advertising business. 
Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) spent about 15.9 billion yuan ($2.45 billion) in the quarter to ramp up its products, a 21% increase compared with a year earlier.
Baidu's video streaming affiliate, iQIYI, posted a 15% increase in advertising revenue and subscribers grew to 106.2 million by June, on the back of more original content.
Total revenue rose to 31.35 billion yuan from 26.03 billion yuan in the second quarter ended June 30, topping analysts' average estimate of 30.96 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Baidu is facing heightened scrutiny from Beijing's regulators who have raised concerns over data security and user privacy, targeting the country's tech giants. 
The tightened scrutiny hasn't exerted a negative impact to its operations yet, Baidu Chairman and Chief Executive Robin Li said on a conference call. 
Earlier this year, Baidu's autonomous driving unit Apollo launched paid robotaxi services, that operate without a driver behind the steering wheel, in Beijing and Guangzhou. 

Its robotaxi services will be cheaper than human drivers in 2025, Li said. Baidu aimed to offer robotaxi services to 3 million users in 2023.

So, we think it could be wise to bet on quality software stocks Software Aktiengesellschaft (STWRY) and  CSG Systems  (CSGS), which look undervalued at their current price levels. Read on.Earlier this year, most investors avoided expensive tech stocks, including those from the software space, and instead bet on cyclical stocks to capitalize on the recovering economy. However, with the rapid spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant, investors are regaining their interest in software stocks with an acceptance that remote working, if not here to stay, is here for at least an extended period.
Investors’ interest in the software stocks is evidenced by the SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF’s (XSW) 11.6% gains over the past three months versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 7.1% returns. Continuing digital transformation and product innovation should help the software industry grow in the coming months. Indeed, according to Statista, IT spending on enterprise software will likely amount to roughly $599 billion this year, representing a 13.2% year-over-year rise.

But the company has yet to announce its earnings since going public. Furthermore, it is not yet profitable in a competitive cannabis landscape. Although a strategic partnership with Avaria and its plans to move its corporate headquarters to Miami from Toronto could bode well for the stock, uncertainty about its growth prospects could unnerve investors.

Buy and Hold These 2 Market-Beating Stocks","Even as the major stock indices hover near their all-time highs, fears of a stock market correction continue to grow. Risks from a spike in COVID-19 cases and potential tax increases have spooked investors and analysts. But against this backdrop, it could be worth buying and holding market-beating stock Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Oracle (ORCL). Given these companies’ solid fundamentals, we think these stocks could generate substantial returns. Let’s discuss.Brushing aside an uncomfortable July inflation report, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record 35,501.16 high yesterday and closed the session at 35,484.97, gaining 0.6%. The S&P 500 also hit its all-time high of 4,449.44 and closed the session 0.2% higher than its 4,447.70 prior close. Although the consumer price index rose 5.4% year-over-year in July, the increase in core inflation was lower than expected.
However, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases due to the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant and potential tax increases have heightened concerns among investors and analysts regarding the potential for a market correction in the near term. For example, Peter Cecchini, the director of research at Axonic Capital, recently asserted that “Equities are in for a sizable correction.” Furthermore, renewed lockdown measures and travel restrictions could pose considerable risks to the economic recovery.

The Bank of England and the Bank of France have expressed concerns about a lack of transparency in how banks rely on a ""concentrated"" number of outside cloud computing providers like Google, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which are beyond the arm of the regulators. 
Regulators are worried that reliance by many banks on the same providers could create systemic risk if one of the cloud companies were to go down.
The survey of 1,300 leaders in financial services from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Britain, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Australia showed that 83% were using the cloud as part of their primary computing infrastructure.

The bulk of the companies are also considering adopting a multicloud strategy, the survey said, which would allow a bank to switch to an alternative provider if there is an outage to avoid an interruption of services for customers.
""Based on the Harris survey, it is clear that financial institutions are taking actions to solve concentration or vendor lock-in concerns with 88% of respondents not currently using a multicloud strategy considering doing so in the next 12 months,"" Adrian Poole, director for financial services in Britain and Ireland for Google Cloud, said.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>","Aviva to return $5.5 billion to investors, Cevian demands more","By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) -British insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV) pledged on Thursday to return at least 4 billion pounds ($5.5 billion) to shareholders, sending its shares surging, but activist investor Cevian Capital demanded more.
Cevian, which revealed in June it had built up a near 5% stake in the FTSE 100 company, promptly reiterated that Aviva should return 5 billion pounds of excess capital by the end of 2022. 
""The at least four billion pounds excess capital return ... is a good start, but ... would not be enough to address the overcapitalisation and we expect the company to return five billion pounds by the end of next year,"" Cevian partner Niko Pakalén said. 
Aviva has raised 7.5 billion pounds from selling eight businesses across the globe since the appointment of Amanda Blanc as chief executive in July 2020. 
The life and general insurer, which has its main businesses in Britain, Canada and Ireland, had previously promised a ""substantial"" capital return.
""We've provided guidance earlier than expected ... we are accelerating the timing of the capital return,"" Blanc told a media call, adding that relations with Cevian were ""constructive"".
Shares hit their highest in eight weeks on the news and were up more than 4% at the top of the FTSE 100 index by 1240 GMT. If gains hold, they'd mark their best one-day advance since the beginning of this year.
Aviva said it intended to return the capital by the end of the first half of 2022, starting with an immediate 750 million pound share buyback.
RE-RATING?
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said the buyback announcement would likely lead to a re-rating of the stock in the next six months, reiterating their ""overweight"" rating.
Aviva said it was on track to achieve a targeted 300 million pounds in cost savings in 2022. 
The insurer has reduced its property portfolio by 30% this year, generating savings of 20 million pounds, Blanc said, and was also making savings through digitisation. 
Cevian has called for at least 500 million pounds in cost savings by 2023. 
Aviva reported a 17% rise in first-half operating profit from continuing operations to 725 million pounds, below a company-provided consensus of 781 million pounds.

The insurer said it would pay an interim dividend of 7.35 pence per share, up 5% but below a forecast 7.37 pence.

The company now expects adjusted free cash flow in excess of $300 million, up from ‘in excess $150 million’ it had projected earlier. It also reiterated its annual revenue growth of 30% or greater for 2021 through 2025.
The software company, focused on defense contracts from government agencies, aviation, healthcare and financial services, grew its second-quarter revenue by 49% $376 million.
Higher operating expenses such as R&D, sales and marketing and general administrative costs dented the growth in revenue and widened the April-June loss to $138.58 million from 2020 quarter’s $110.45 million.
Adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis came at 4 cents and were higher than estimated.
It closed 62 deals of $1 million or more, of which 30 deals are worth $5 million or more and 21 deals carry potential revenue of $10 million each or more.

Investors are awaiting the week’s second dose of inflation data, after Wednesday’s soft CPI release, with producer prices for July expected to rise 7.3% in July over last year, unchanged from the previous month, which was the largest annual increase in more than 10 years.
In addition to persistently higher inflation, the Federal Reserve is also keeping an eye on the recovery in the labor market, and the weekly initial jobless claims are expected to fall by 10,000 to 375,000 last week, after falling by 14,000 the week before.

Lordstown has a 6.2 million square foot manufacturing plant and 650-acre campus.
Strand said commercial deliveries of Endurance, a full-size electric pickup truck, will happen in the early part of 2022’s second quarter.

LONDON (Reuters) -Holiday company TUI Group said on Thursday a surge in bookings from Germany had driven a recovery from the pandemic slump and an easing of travel restrictions in Britain would add momentum. 
The German-based company said bookings had jumped by 1.5 million since May, and in total it had 4.2 million bookings for this summer, compared to about 9 million in a typical summer, helping to ease pressure on finances which have been strained by the COVID-19 crisis.
""We are adding bookings every day,"" chief executive Fritz Joussen told reporters.
Britain's slower than expected reopening of travel dragged on TUI in its April-June quarter, but Joussen said UK bookings were rising after the government scrapped quarantine for fully-vaccinated people to most holiday destinations in mid-July. 
The slower UK opening, however, forced the group to cut its summer capacity to 60% of its 2019 programme, down from the 75% planned in May. 
TUI's London-listed shares rose 1% to 336 pence in mid-morning deals, paring earlier gains of 3%. 
Bookings from Germany and the rest of continental Europe helped TUI turn cash flow positive in April-June, for the first time since the pandemic started, with a cash inflow of 320 million euros ($375.78 million). 
""The good thing is liquidity is out of the way, we are not burning cash anymore,"" Joussen said, adding that profitability would be ""reasonably good in summer"" and bookings for 2022 were very strong. 
TUI has taken on loans of over 4 billion euros and been bailed out multiple times by the German government after the pandemic forced it to stop running holidays last year.
Joussen reiterated the company would consider raising capital to help pay down debt at some point. In July, its banks agreed to extend its credit lines by two years to 2024.

For its third quarter, TUI posted an adjusted loss before interest and tax of 670 million euros on revenues of 650 million euros.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) confirmed it was in active talks to sell its Dutch unit, signaling movement on Thursday on its portfolio of non-core assets as it reported a forecast-beating set of second-quarter results and raised its outlook.
Shares in the group, which spans the United States and Europe as well as its German home market, rose 2% to within touching distance of their highest level since the dot-com crash nearly 20 years ago.
CEO Tim Hoettges, on a call with reporters, said the group was ""in the middle of a transaction"" to sell its Dutch unit.
T-Mobile Netherlands has grown in recent years and doubled profits, he said, but as a mobile-only play lacked a strategic fit with Deutsche Telekom's other European operations that offer ""converged"" fixed-line and mobile services.
""We will sell if the price is right,"" Hoettges said, confirming a Bloomberg report this week that Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries was in talks to buy T-Mobile Netherlands.
Hoettges declined to name his price but Bloomberg, citing sources, said Deutsche Telekom was seeking 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) for the Dutch business.
He said he was still evaluating options for mobile masts unit Deutsche Funkturm, including a partnership with a large towers company, a partial sale or an initial public offering. No final decision has been taken.
Hoettges' comments signaled a renewed appetite for deals after U.S. unit T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) took over rival Sprint last year - a transaction that has powered growth and profits.
T-Mobile US beat forecasts and raised its outlook when it reported quarterly results recently - leading Hoettges to follow suit by upping his target for group profits.
Deutsche Telekom now expects adjusted core profit of more than 37.2 billion euros this year, up by 200 million from its previous view.
Reported group revenue declined by 1.7% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA after leases declined by 4.2%, but after accounting for one-off factors such as exchange rate moves, they were up 6.8% and 1.1% respectively on an organic basis.

Group revenue, core profit and adjusted net profit all comfortably beat consensus estimates in a poll of analysts published by the company, with analysts saying that the non-U.S. business had also outperformed.
""Overall, this is a strong set of results with lots to like, in our view,"" said Georgios Ierodiaconou at Citi. ($1 = 0.8517 euros)

202,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 06:07AM ET</span>","Lighter winds slow progress at offshore firms Orsted, RWE","By Stine Jacobsen and Christoph Steitz
COPENHAGEN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Orsted and RWE, the world's two largest offshore wind players, both suffered from lighter winds in the first half of the year, highlighting how profits in the booming industry remain tied to weather conditions.
Denmark's Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) said wind speeds in the April-June period were ""significantly lower than normal"" and ranked among the worst three quarters in over more than 20 years. 
As a consequence, it said it would likely hit only the lower end of its guided core profit range in 2021. 
Orsted was however confident that it wind speeds would return to more normal levels.
""Over time the wind speeds have been incredibly stable. We build wind farms that have an average life time of 30+ years and we have no reason to believe that this is something which will structurally challenge that,"" CEO Mads Nipper told journalists.
Shares in Orsted traded 2.3% lower at 0933 GMT, while RWE slipped 0.1%.
Orsted said quarterly wind speeds amounted to an average of 7.8 meters per second (m/s) across its offshore portfolio, which was lower than the 8.4 m/s seen in the second quarter last year and the normal wind speeds of 8.6 m/s it had expected.
Germany's RWE also cited much lower wind volumes in Northern and Central Europe compared with the very high level last year, reporting a 22% decline in core profits at its offshore unit to 459 million euros ($539 million) in the first half.
GENTLE WINDS
The results show that despite strong fundamentals, renewables continue to be an intermittent technology where swings in the level of winds and sunshine have a direct impact on earnings.
To mitigate some of the risks Orsted, mainly focused on the North Sea today, is expanding into new parts of the world such as the United States and Taiwan and has invested in technologies including solar PV and onshore wind.
That view was shared by RWE.
""We also need diversification ... because sometimes the business is volatile. And ideally it's diversification across different technologies but also across different regions,"" CEO Markus Krebber told journalists.
While Orsted's Nipper said that so far there were no indications that more extreme weather linked to global warming would have an impact, Krebber struck a more cautious tone after its business was hit by cold spells and floods this year.
""Aside from the fight against climate change we also have to deal with these weather effects becoming more regular.""
The weather is not the only challenge faced by firms in the industry, after some of the world's largest turbine makers, including Denmark's Vestas and Spanish-listed Siemens Gamesa, pointed to high raw materials prices.

Denmark's Vestas, the world's largest wind turbines maker, this week cut its 2021 outlook, citing constraints in the freight market related to the impact of COVID-19 which have driven global supply chains towards breaking point.

The world's largest contract electronics maker has benefited from strong demand for technology products as people continue to telecommute amid the pandemic - a trend smartphone and laptop sellers such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and Lenovo say is likely to persist.
For the Taiwanese company, demand for smartphones has been the main driver of record high net profit and revenue in the first half of the year, Chief Financial Officer David Huang said on a conference call to discuss second-quarter results.
For April-June, Foxconn's revenue rose by a fifth to T$1.35 trillion from a year earlier. For the third quarter, it forecast a 3-15% rise in overall revenue and a more than 15% jump in revenue from its consumer electronics business.
Chairman Liu Young-way said the forecasts were based on the pandemic development at the moment.
""The epidemic situation appears to be worsening in Asia,"" he said. ""Because Asia is the key global hub for ICT components, it needs to be closely watched whether the epidemic will have an impact to the overall supply chain,"" he said, referring to the supply chain for tech products.
Countries in the Asia-Pacific region https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/latest-worldwide-spread-coronavirus-2021-02-18, including Australia, Japan, Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia have seen a recent rise is COVID-19 cases, leading to stricter curbs.
The pandemic has shaken supply chains and fuelled a months-long global shortage of chips https://www.reuters.com/technology/stmicros-average-chip-prices-up-5-so-far-this-year-ceo-says-2021-07-29 that has hurt many smartphone makers, consumer device firms and car companies.
But Foxconn felt only a small impact from the chip shortage in the April-June quarter thanks to A-list clients who had more clout with their suppliers, Liu said. He reiterated that the shortage could extend into the second quarter of 2022.
IPHONE SALES TO BOOST BUSINESS
Apple said in July that the chip shortage that hurt its ability to sell Macs and iPads will start to affect iPhone production and forecast slowing revenue growth.
Despite the bearish outlook, analysts said Apple's upcoming iPhone 13 models would still boost Foxconn's business, with Taipei-based Fubon Securities expecting Foxconn to assemble 75% of the forecast total of 85 million new iPhones this year.
Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, had been seeking to buy chip plants to stabilise supplies for its new business in electric vehicles (EV) - a sector in which it plans to become a major player by between 2025 and 2027.
EV is likely to bring in revenue of more than T$10 billion this year, representing a 40% increase from a year ago, with growth expected to be even higher next year, Liu said. 
For the April-June quarter, Foxconn's net profit rose to T$29.779 billion ($1.07 billion), compared with a Refinitiv consensus estimate of T$25.98 billion drawn from 12 analysts.

Foxconn's shares have risen about 16% this year. They ended flat on Thursday, in line with the broader market.

(Reuters) - Coca Cola HBC on Thursday agreed to buy a majority stake in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Bottling Company of Egypt for $427 million after the Swiss-based soft drinks bottler reported a surge in half-year profits.
A unit of HBC will buy about 94.7% of the Egyptian company from its major shareholders including affiliates of The  Coca-Cola Co  and MAC Beverages, HBC said. 
The deal, which would allow HBC to expand in its largest market Nigeria and grow in Egypt, was announced shortly after the company reported a nearly 68% surge in comparable operating profit to 350.3 million euros for the six months ended July 2.
The company, which bottles and sells Coca-Cola Co drinks in 28 countries and is 23.16% owned by the U.S. company, warned that operating profit margins would be lower in the second half compared with a year earlier due to rising cost inflation.
Nonetheless, the company expects margins to expand by 20 to 30 basis points in 2021, thanks to strength in the first half and as revenue is expected to recover with people eating and drinking out more as restrictions lift.
HBC CEO Zoran Bogdanovic told Reuters that higher raw material costs are expected to continue into 2022.
""Given rising input cost inflation, we struggle to see upside risk to consensus margin expectations in FY22,"" said analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
A host of factors, including disruptions in global supply chains and rising demand, has pushed up raw material prices, forcing packaged food companies such as PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and rival Coca-Cola Co to pass on costs to consumers.

HBC said it expects the Egypt deal to add to earnings in the near term.

Investing.com -- BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose in premarket trade on Thursday, on track to recover some of the previous session’s losses, following a report in the Wall Street Journal that the FDA could authorize Covid-19 booster shots for immunocompromised people.
BioNTech and Moderna were up 5% and 2.5% after plunging 14% and 15.6% in the previous session, respectively.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which shed 4% on Wednesday, was up 0.6%.
The WSJ reported that the Food and Drug Administration is nearing a decision to authorize booster shots for people with weak immunity amid a surge in new COVID cases because of the rapid spread of the delta variant.
There is growing evidence that two shots of the vaccines are inadequate for people with low immunity. Vaccine makers plan to approach the FDA this month or next for approval to their booster shots.  
BioNTech, Moderna and Pfizer all closed lower Wednesday following news that Europe’s drug regulator is studying three new conditions reported by a small number of people after getting Covid-19 shots to assess if they may be possible side-effects.
The conditions were reported in patients who took the mRNA vaccines made by either Moderna or BioNTech-Pfizer.
Pfizer and BioNTech are collaborating on the research and marketing of their COVID-19 vaccine. Expenses and profit from the vaccine are split equally between Pfizer and BioNTech.  "

(Reuters) -  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) owner Entain reported higher first-half profit on Thursday buoyed by the Euro 2020 soccer tournament, which the British gambling company called its biggest sports betting event yet.
Previously known as GVC, the company also saw a rise in online net gaming revenue, reporting in July its 22nd straight quarter of double-digit growth as people turned to the internet for entertainment during lockdowns.
The London-listed company also launched a cost savings programme to help it invest in its platforms and to drive expansion. Entain expects to save 100 million pounds in 2023, and invest roughly the same amount over three years. 
Entain, which owns the bwin, Coral and Eurobet brands, and in April bought European groups Bet.pt and Enlabs AB, has plans to double investment in its game development studios as it increases its focus on online betting. 
For the six months to June 30, underlying core profit rose 12% to 401.1 million pounds ($556 million), Entain said.
The sector is recovering from a year of cancelled sporting events and shuttered retail betting shops because of the pandemic. Provided COVID-19 restrictions continued to be eased, Entain said it would be ""in a position to recommence a dividend"". In April last year, it withheld its interim dividend and has not declared one since.
Entain's joint venture in the United States with casino operator MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) has also performed well, and it said it expects to be operational in around 20 U.S. states over the next 12 months. 
Following the first-half update, Entain said it was confident of its prospects for the rest of the year and maintained its forecast for 2021 profit of between 850 million pounds and 900 million pounds. 
The Euros ran into Entain's second half for a few days. 
Entain said it would hold an investor event later on Thursday to outline plans for its business, including ""growth opportunities,"" without elaborating further.

Entain's shares had risen about 74% this year, but fell 0.7% to 1,951 pence by 0738 GMT in volatile trading.

(Reuters) -Chinese electric vehicle maker Li Auto made a weak debut in Hong Kong on Thursday as its shares closed down, while the company also flagged it could consider a mainland listing.
The company raised $1.52 billion https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinese-ev-maker-li-auto-raise-152-bln-hong-kong-listing-sources-2021-08-06 by pricing its stock at HK$118 each in its dual primary listing in the city. Li Auto is also listed in New York.
The stock ended the day down 0.8% to HK$117 in a broader market, the Hang Seng Index, which was down 0.5%. 
Li Auto shares fell as much as 2.1% earlier in the session, while rival Xpeng Inc dropped 3.46% for the day. 
The weaker debut followed a 1.1% rise in New York-listed Li Auto shares on Wednesday.
Li Auto's Hong Kong deal is the first major listing of a Chinese company after mainland authorities implemented strict new regulations https://www.reuters.com/world/china/education-bitcoin-chinas-season-regulatory-crackdown-2021-07-27 on industries ranging from tech to education and online gaming.
Officials have also flagged tighter rules https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-widens-clampdown-overseas-listings-with-pre-ipo-review-firms-with-large-2021-07-10 on companies listing overseas that have major data components in their businesses. 
At HK$118 each, the price represented a 3.2% discount to the level where the New York stock was trading before the Hong Kong deal was launched on Aug. 3.
Li Auto's president Shen Yanan told reporters that the company was internally discussing the possibility of issuing A-shares in mainland China.
It is developing battery electric vehicles in addition to its current extended range electric vehicle model, which uses a different powertrain, to expand its customer base, Shen said.
The first battery electric model is expected to be sold in 2023, Shen said.
Li Auto plans to set up a new factory in Beijing to expand manufacturing capacity and to have more showrooms in shopping malls across Chinese cities to expand sales channels, Shen said.
DUAL PRIMARY LISTING 
The electric vehicle maker had aimed to raise more funds at its Hong Kong debut but the stock dropped 4% in the United States last Thursday before the price was finalised, which reduced the amount investors were willing to pay.
The U.S. listed stock has fallen 8.75% in the past week but remains 6.5% higher for the year.
""Since the price for the Hong Kong shares has been set, Li Auto's share price in the U.S. has been down quite a bit so that has set the tone for Hong Kong,"" Kingston Securities director Dickie Wong said.
""Given its a dual listing, we should see the Hong Kong shares trade in line with the U.S., and there doesn't seem to be much upside at the moment.""
Li Auto sold 100 million shares in the Hong Kong deal and chose a dual primary listing rather than a secondary listing as it has been listed in New York for less than two years.

Under Hong Kong rules, a secondary listing requires at least two financial years of good regulatory compliance on another qualifying exchange.
Dual primary listing allows qualified Chinese investors to take part through the Stock Connect regime linking mainland Chinese and Hong Kong markets, according to the exchange's rules.

LONDON (Reuters) - British online fashion retailer Boohoo said on Thursday it would invest 500 million pounds ($693 million) in the United Kingdom over the next five years, creating 5,000 jobs and increasing its ability to meet rising demand at home and abroad.
Retailers are in a race to strengthen logistics to improve delivery fulfilment after the acceleration in online shopping caused by the pandemic.
Based in Manchester, northern England, Boohoo sells clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products aimed at 16 to 40-year olds. It has expanded rapidly since launching in 2006 and trades from 13 brands.
Boohoo said its growing global appeal, with half of its sales coming from overseas markets, such as the United States and Australia, meant it needed additional warehouse space and to invest in technology to increase efficiency.
""The investments we have planned will help us to continue our growth, increasing our customer base both at home and abroad, adding even more value as we do so,"" Chief Executive John Lyttle said.
Boohoo shares were up 1% at 0724 GMT.
In April, Boohoo secured a new warehouse in Daventry, central England, that will boost its sales capacity to more than 4 billion pounds - more than double its 2020-21 revenue of 1.75 billion pounds.
In February, Boohoo purchased the Debenhams brand out of administration for 55 million pounds and the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton brands from the administrators of Arcadia for 25.2 million pounds.
The group's rapid growth has drawn criticism.
Last September Boohoo accepted all the recommendations of an independent review that found major failings in its supply chain in England after newspaper allegations about working conditions and low pay in factories in the Leicester area.
The group has pledged to fix the problems with its 'Agenda for Change' programme.
Some shareholder advisory groups and investors remain dissatisfied. At its annual shareholders' meeting in June some 12% of votes cast opposed the re-election to the board of co-founder and executive director Carol Kane.

And despite strong sales growth during the pandemic Boohoo's shares are down 22% so far in 2021.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 03:51AM ET</span>",Bearish bets held steady on Asian FX as virus woes persist: Reuters poll,"By Harish Sridharan
(Reuters) - Investors remained bearish towards most Asian currencies, with the Thai baht faring the worst as economies across the region continued to struggle with Delta variant outbreaks, while strength in the dollar also weighed, a Reuters poll found. 
Short bets were slightly raised on the Chinese yuan, Singapore dollar and the Indian rupee compared to two weeks ago, while they were mostly maintained on the Philippine peso and the Indonesian rupiah, a poll of 11 respondents showed. 
Sentiment reversed on the Taiwanese dollar as investors went bullish on the currency for the first time since early July as strong exports data pointed to improved growth prospects. 
The surge in cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus is rattling parts of Asia, with Thailand and South Korea posting record daily infections, and sluggish vaccination programs further burdening their health infrastructures.
Regional currencies also fell out of favour as the dollar held a four-month peak after a recent run of strong jobs data fuelled expectations of earlier monetary policy tightening in the United States.
Bearish bets on the baht were at their highest since August 2015, after the Bank of Thailand last week downgraded the trade and tourism-reliant country's growth forecast for the third time this year. 
The baht has weakened more than 11% and is the worst performing currency in the region so far this year, while Thai stocks have shed almost 3.5% since the end of June.
""Domestically, the baht is at risk to another downgrade in Thailand's outlook... which cannot be ruled out if the pandemic is not brought under control by early fourth quarter,"" analysts at DBS said in a research note. 
""Externally, the baht is not immune to the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish tilt,"" they added.
Investors slightly raised their short positions on the yuan, as recent economic indicators pointed to slowing economic growth, while China's latest COVID-19 outbreak clouded the outlook.
While the yuan has been resilient compared to its peers in the last few weeks, China's latest outbreak - now into its fourth week - threatens to curtail tourism and activity in the services sector.
Meanwhile, the Taiwan dollar was an outlier as strong exports data pointed to a brighter economic outlook. Exports rose for a 13th straight month to hit a record high in July, driven by manufacturers rushing to meet a global chip shortage. 
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.
A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Cellcom, which de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange in February, said on Thursday it lost 14 million shekels ($4 million) in the quarter, versus a 46 million shekel loss a year earlier. Revenue rose 17.3% to 1 billion shekels.
It was forecast to lose 11 million shekels in the quarter, according to a Reuters poll of analysts.
The company reported a 32 million shekel provision due to a court ruling that it will have to repay customers who were overcharged. Cellcom said it plans to appeal the decision.
Like its peers, Cellcom has been pressured in recent years by intense competition in the mobile sector while the coronavirus pandemic hurt revenues from roaming services of customers travelling overseas as well as roaming services of tourists travelling to Israel.
As a result, Cellcom has sought other streams of revenue, such as providing fibre optic broadband and internet-based TV services.
Its number of internet customers was up 4.5% in the second quarter to 296,000 -- 113,000 of those connected to its fibre network -- while TV subscribers rose 2% to 250,000.

Mobile phone subscribers rose 18% to 3,226 million.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 03:16AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Peak inflation?,"A look at the day ahead from Tommy Wilkes. 
Closely-anticipated U.S. inflation figures are easing concerns about runaway price growth and helping U.S. and global stocks notch up yet more record highs. 
Wednesday's 0.5% reading for the consumer price index in July was the largest drop in month-to-month inflation in 15 months and has some investors starting to bet long-feared inflation on the back of pandemic-era stimulus may be peaking. U.S. Treasury yields fell, erasing some of this month's surge. 
The reading certainly eases pressure on the Federal Reserve by supporting its assertion than inflation rises are temporary and gives the central bank more time to decide when to taper asset purchases. It also gives ammunition to bulls determined to push stocks higher.
On Thursday markets looked set to take a breather, with both U.S. and European stock futures flat or down slightly.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields held above 1.3% -- while inflation fears may be receding for now, the benchmark yield is still nearly 20 basis points higher than in early August.
Elsewhere, data showed that Britain's economy grew by a faster-than expected 1.0% in June, boosted by the huge services sector.
The mood in Asia, where stocks have underperformed U.S. and European peers recently, was downbeat again after China said it would draft new laws on national security, technology innovation, monopolies and education, as well as in areas involving foreigners -- the latest regulatory crackdown. 
Fears about the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant in Asia have also sapped confidence, with stocks lower on Thursday.
In currency markets, the dollar recouped some of Wednesday's tumble after the lower inflation reading.
Oil prices mostly held gains from earlier in the week, with Brent firmly above $71 a barrel and U.S. crude at $69.
In corporate news, German online takeaway food firm Delivery Hero raised its 2021 outlook after more than doubling quarterly revenues.
 Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors said it would return at least 4 billion pounds ($5.5 billion) to shareholders after a rise in profits -- the latest European firm to return to buybacks. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday:
- Emerging markets: Mexico, Turkey, Serbia,  Philippines, Peru central banks meet
- U.S. PPI/initial jobless claims data
- Auctions: 4-week T-bills, 30-year Treasuries

214,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 03:06AM ET</span>",Analysis-Investors renew focus on Fed following signs inflation may have peaked,"By Lewis Krauskopf and David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Data on Wednesday hinted that U.S. inflation may have peaked, reassuring investors that the Federal Reserve will not feel obligated to hasten plans to rein in emergency-level support of the economy, but they remained worried that rising prices could continue to weigh on everything from bond prices to corporate margins.
Data showed on Wednesday that U.S. consumer price increases slowed in July even as they remained at a 13-year high on a yearly basis. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record levels, while U.S. Treasury yields fell across most maturities.
Some investors said the data bolstered the Fed's assertion that jumps in inflation will be relatively fleeting, partly reflecting supply chain bottlenecks that will ease with time. 
But they added that inflation remains elevated, which can sap profit margins and erode the value of bonds. 
Other concerns: corporate earnings growth appeared to be hitting a peak; rising coronavirus cases could threaten the economy; and stocks are generally trading at historically high valuations. 
The inflation data would help the Fed feel a ""a little bit more confident that they can let inflation run a little bit hotter in the near term without having to worry about overshooting,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rate strategist at TD Securities. ""Markets are reacting with a bit of relief, which I think makes a lot of sense,"" Goldberg added. The Fed has dropped interest rates to rock-bottom levels and is currently making $120 billion in monthly bond purchases, as it has aimed to spur spending and borrowing. The question of when and at what pace it expects to taper those purchases looms large over markets. 
""The concern has been how soon and how quickly will the Fed begin to taper its bond purchases and this lends some credence to the argument that the inflation pressures we are seeing are transitory,” Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, said after the inflation data.
In a research note,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists said Wednesday’s CPI data “supports the view that the last few months likely marked the peak rates of inflation.” 
PEAK EVERYTHING?
A peak in inflation rates would coincide with an expected peak in earnings growth for the second quarter. As of Friday, with over 440 companies reported, S&P 500 second-quarter earnings are expected to have climbed 93.1%, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Steep increases in inflation and earnings growth ""are telling you the same thing, which is a year ago things were really dire and this year things are rebounding,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis.
Samana said stocks remained attractive over bonds as he still expects S&P 500 earnings growth of about 10% in 2022 while interest rates remain low.
Concerns about inflation early this year drove a selloff in Treasury bonds, lifting yields, while the stock market saw a rally in cyclical and value stock groups such as financials and energy. 
Since the end of March, however, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has fallen over 40 basis points, while the Russell 1000 value stock index has climbed only about 7% against a 17% rise for a counterpart index of tech and other growth stocks. 

Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood, whose Ark Innovation ETF was the top performing U.S. equity fund last year, made the case in a webinar Tuesday that falling lumber and oil prices signal that inflation has peaked and that growth stocks will start to once again outperform as they did during the economic lockdowns in 2020. 
Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, said the inflation data on Wednesday was positive for stocks. But he added, ""Is the inflation scare over? Not by a long shot.""

215,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 02:51AM ET</span>","Henkel cautious on costs, supply chains, even as sales jump","BERLIN (Reuters) -German consumer goods group Henkel voiced concern about rising prices and over-stretched supply chains, although it raised its full-year sales outlook on Thursday after its business rebounded above pre-crisis levels in the first half.
""The exceptionally sharp rise in raw material prices and strained supply chains will weigh heavily on the economy in the further course of the year,"" Chief Executive Carsten Knobel said.
Henkel was trying to limit the impact on profits, he added, and also said growth rates would probably slow in the second half of 2021 versus the first half as the rebound in industrial demand began in the second half of 2020.
Henkel said it expected 2021 sales to rise an organic 6-8%, up from a previous 4-6% forecast, and confirmed it expected earnings per preferred share to rise in the high single-digit to mid-teens percentage range.
It slightly lowered its forecast for its operating earnings margin to 13.5-14.5% of sales from a previous 14-15%.
Consumer goods group Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co said last month it expects higher core earnings this year, while warning of a nearly $2 billion hit from rising commodity and transportation expenses. It is relying on price increases and cost cuts to cushion the impact.
Henkel's second-quarter sales rose an organic 15% to 4.96 billion euros ($5.82 billion), just shy of average analyst consensus for 4.98 billion.
The adhesives unit, which supplies the automotive and electronics industries and accounts for almost half of sales, recorded organic growth of 28.5%, helped by global economic recovery.
The maker of Schwarzkopf hair care products said its beauty care business saw sales jump 8.2% in the second quarter as hair salons reopened after lockdowns.
Henkel, which aims to divest or discontinue brands and categories worth around 500 million euros by the end of 2021, said it had already reached around 350 million euros of the target, mainly in the consumer business.

German rival Beiersdorf last week also reported strong demand for adhesives and its dermatological brands, pushing its shares up.

By Divya Chowdhury
(Reuters) - The unpredictability of China's regulatory measures make the country unappealing to foreign investors in the short-term, following its latest crackdowns on the technology, property and education sectors, global fund managers said.
However, if these measures were turned into meaningful reforms that protected data and reduced monopolistic practices, they could increase China's long-term attractiveness, they told the Reuters Global Markets Forum this week.
""I think investors just don't like the uncertainty of not knowing what's the next shoe to drop,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Haefele, who runs investment strategy for the world's largest wealth manager with $3.2 trillion in assets, said it was still early days and he would wait to see ""how long this plays out.""
(GRAPHIC: China stocks versus global benchmarks - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjoaaove/Pasted%20image%201628254464798.png) 
Foreign investors will be ""absolutely"" circumspect about increasing their investments in China in the short term, said Yicheng Zhang, chief executive of Chinese private equity firm CITIC Capital.
Even though China's regulatory moves were expected due to the country's shifting focus to ""common prosperity,"" the specific tactics used were surprising and have caused shockwaves, Hong Kong-based Zhang, who manages $36 billion, said.
""Fundamentally, it surprised me as well, turning some of these companies overnight into not-for-profit entities,"" he said, adding foreign investors' concerns about these measures' lack of respect for property rights was understandable.
China's moves to liberalise its financial markets over the last few years, along with its cheap valuations within emerging markets, are also helping retain the country's long-term appeal.
""China wants to continue to open up its financial markets, and they recognise that to do so effectively, they need to move more cautiously as they institute these reforms,"" Haefele said.
""That could be a very positive narrative,"" he added.
Haefele said his exposure to China was in line with a broad long-term emerging market allocation, and was bullish on various sectors, including fintech, health tech, sustainability and 5G. 
Justin Onuekwusi, LGIM's head of retail multi-asset funds, said his firm continued to hold Chinese stocks as they represented better value at current levels than their European and U.S. peers.
Meanwhile, financial company AIA's group CIO Mark Konyn, who manages $230 billion, viewed the crackdowns as only a transitionary phase.
Zhang believed China was ""investable"" in the long term as the actions were not a shift in policy direction. ""People will understand that this is more an accident than a trend.""
The actions have in fact cooled-off some of the market ""frenzy,"" making valuations in some sectors quite cheap, he said.
Zhang said CITIC Capital's investment strategy was focussed on buyout-related traditional sectors, including business services, consumer, healthcare, and non-internet technology.

However, the education sector has hit ""rock bottom,"" Zhang said, adding that with the short-term policy outlook looking uncertain, ""it's best to be on the sidelines for now.""

217,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 12:56AM ET</span>",Global investors bet on China's rental property amid shifting political winds,"By Samuel Shen and Kane Wu
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Beijing's regulatory firestorm is hitting large swathes of China's economy, but global investors including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Warburg Pincus are ramping up bets on Chinese rental properties, judging the political wind is blowing in their favour.
China has cracked down on private tutoring, brought monopolistic tech giants to their knees, and stepped up curbs on home buying. But Beijing is wooing capital to help provide rental housing and is attracting plenty of institutional interest.
In China, ""people need to be housed, but houses have become too expensive to buy. You need to have housing for rent,"" said Graeme Torre, managing director of APG Asset Management, which has entered China's rental housing market in partnership with U.S. property developer and operator Greystar.
""We like to invest with policy rather than trying to avoid it or invest against it. So I'd like to think it's politically correct,"" Torre said, estimating APG will commit around 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion) into Chinese rental housing over the next 3-5 years.
Centralized long-term rental apartments - or multifamily as they're called in the United States - are the best solution to the housing affordability issue in China's cosmopolitan cities, said Qiqi Zhang, managing director of Warburg Pincus .
""We think long-term rental housing is the next big opportunity in China, like logistics real estate a decade ago, or data centres five years ago."" 
The U.S. private equity giant has backed Chinese apartment rental brands including Mofang, Ziroom, TULU and Base.
There was little institutional interest in China's rental property market before 2017, when President Xi Jinping told the 19th Communist Party congress China will encourage both housing purchase and renting. Beijing has stepped up calls this year to increase supply of rental housing. 
Among measures China has rolled out to revamp a market dominated by retail landlords, institutional investors hail two recent incentives - a big tax break effective this October, and the launch of a market for real estate investment trusts (REITs). 
NEEDLE MOVER 
The tax break - expected to boost margins by 10% for operators - and a potential exit channel through REITs are ""the needle mover,"" said Eric Pang, China head of Capital Markets for property consultancy JLL . 
Investors will also benefit from demographic tailwinds.
Increasing population density and mobility in big cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, draconian curbs on home buying, as well as later marriages and childbearing will boost demand for multifamily housing, Pang said. 
""This is a market with big potential,"" he added. ""Global funds seeking returns will ramp up investment."" 
Foreign institutions already involved in China's rental housing market include Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). 
""Transaction volume in China won't climb to $10 billion overnight, but there will be significant growth in the medium term,"" said Henry Chin, APAC head of research at CBRE , which recently helped Blackstone acquire a rental property in Shanghai. 
Greystar, which launched a $550 million China-focused fund in 2019 in partnership with Dutch pension investor APG and other global institutional investors, said it will now step up investing in China as government support becomes tangible. It already owns a 474-room rental apartment building in downtown Shanghai as well one under development.
BRAND VALUES
""It's a bit like luxury cars. There's an added value to the product if there is a recognised and reputable brand attached,"" said Torre of APG, which is backing Greystar's China expansion.
China's total renter population will exceed 240 million in 2022, and in Shanghai alone, the mid- and high-end multifamily market will generate at least 150 billion yuan ($23 billion) in annual rental incomes, CBRE estimates.
Opportunistic capital is piling in. Private equity and venture capital investment in the sector has surged over the past few years, according to CBRE.
Debt-fuelled expansion by some operators who adopt a light-asset model - renting flats from landlords on long-term leases and then subleting the properties to tenants - led to financial turmoil last year that crippled Danke Apartment, a major online apartment rental platform.
""It's not the problem with the market. It's the problem with some players' business models,"" said Charles Ma, Greater China Managing Director of Greystar, adding more investors are adopting the strategy of buying-and-holding.
""The industry shakeout is good for us. We have patience investing in this market.""

Investing.com – Chinese electric vehicle maker  Li Auto  Inc. (HK:2015) made a disappointing entry to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, with shares not exceeding their offer price of HK$118.
Li Auto’s Hong Kong shares were steady at HK$118 ($15.17) by 12:37 AM ET (4:37 AM GMT).
However, the company raised $1.52 billion in its dual primary listing in the city, following a debut in New York in 2020 that raised around $1.3 billion. It had hoped to raise more, but a 4% drop in its U.S shares (NASDAQ:LI) last Thursday, before the offer price was determined, reduced the amount investors were willing to pay.
The proceeds from the Hong Kong offering will be used for research and development,  marketing and promotion, infrastructure expansion and general corporate purposes.
Li Auto is also internally discussing the possibility of issuing A-shares in mainland China, president and executive director Yanan Shen told the media.
Meanwhile, the company plans to set up a new factory in Beijing to expand its manufacturing capacity and have more showrooms in shopping malls across China to expand sales channels. It is also developing battery electric vehicles in addition to its current extended-range electric vehicle model to expand its customer base, said Shen, with the first battery-electric model expected to be sold in 2023."

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Ltd reported a smaller-than-expected drop in profit for the first half on Thursday, pushing up its shares even as earnings at its core wealth and funds businesses continued to deteriorate.
AMP's shares rose 3.9% despite the shrunken wealth manager registering A$2.7 billion ($2 billion) in client outflows and halting dividend payments until it completes the spin off of its funds management unit in 2022.
The 172-year old firm has been embroiled in scandals surrounding its practices and corporate culture, including a lawsuit for charging pensioners 'fees for no service', even as it works to divest and simplify its portfolio. 
""There are certainly some positives in the result,"" said Tim Hillier, of Allan Gray, AMP's largest shareholder. ""We are happy with the simplification process they have been undertaking - this will enable them to offer better products.""
For the six months ended June, AMP's statutory profit fell to A$146 million from A$203 million reported a year ago, but better than a consensus estimate of A$112 million.
Underlying earnings, the company's preferred metric that excludes one-off items such as client remediation payments, was up 57% to A$181 million.
The flagship Australian wealth management division reported a 17% drop in underlying earnings to A$48 million and ongoing cash outflows, albeit less than the A$4 billion a year earlier.
""Clearly we're still seeing outflows and that is a real concern to me and something I want to focus on,"" said new Chief Executive Alexis George, who started in the role this month. 
""I think that's about some reputation issues that we need to improve and we're all focused on doing that."" 
Its banking division was the stand out performer with a 76% jump in earnings to A$88 million, helped by the reclassification to profit of cash set aside for bad debts due to the pandemic. 
AMP said it had A$452 million in surplus capital and that it would review the payment of dividends and its capital management strategy after completing the demerger of AMP Capital's Private Markets business, expected in the first half of 2022.
The Sydney-based company said it was on-track to deliver A$300 million of annual run-rate cost savings by fiscal 2022, but analysts say separation costs could be higher than expected.

AMP is also set to sell its global equities and fixed income business to Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY).

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors in China are turning to semiconductors, renewable energy and consumer-focused firms in the belief they offer safe-harbour from a blizzard of regulatory action that has battered confidence and forced funds to overhaul their portfolios.
Money managers view months of crackdowns that have hammered shares in sectors from tutoring to big tech as part of a major push from China's Communist Party leadership to pursue common prosperity at the expense of private-sector profit.
Yet as selling has wiped billions from the value of companies in the crosshairs, such as online giants Tencent and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), share prices of firms seen on the right side of reform have surged.
Since June, for example, China indexes of clean energy stocks and semiconductor firms are up more than 30% compared with a 5% fall in the broader market and a 15% drop in Hong Kong tech shares.
""The buying has come from all kind of investors,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) senior investment strategist Suresh Tantia.
""Foreign investors' mutual funds, they still need to allocate their money in China due to their mandates so they are now wanting to invest in line with where the government is delivering support,"" he said.
Investors sifting state media and President Xi Jinping's speeches and books for policy clues saw one standout focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions - with broad goals for peak carbon emissions in 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. 
Similar broad goals for driving domestic demand and home-grown production have put support under mainland-listed consumer discretionary firms and industrials.
""There's (electric vehicles), renewables, semiconductors from a self sufficiency stand point ... we look at these sectors and see that they could well keep on receiving support,"" said Alex Wolf, head of investment strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank.
""Another one is upgrading manufacturing,"" he said. ""China is very keen, and they have said it in the five-year plan, to maintain manufacturing as a certain share of the economy ...(and) if anything increasing it.""

Like portfolio managers at Citi Private Bank and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Wealth Management, Wolf favours mainland listings as less exposed to regulatory scrutiny and because the composition of the market tilts away from targets like tech or internet firms.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) chief Asia economist Chetan Ahya said in a note last week; ""Our equity strategists (believe that) over time, the MSCI China universe will gradually have a more balanced sector allocation with a reduced weight for internet and a higher weight for sectors like industrials and IT.""

221,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 10:45PM ET</span>",Australia's NAB upbeat on post-lockdown outlook after Q3 profit jumps 10%,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd, the third-biggest lender in the country, on Thursday posted a 10% jump in a key third-quarter profit measure and predicted a strong rebound for the Australian economy once ongoing coronavirus lockdowns are eased.
NAB's cash profit, adjusted for non-cash and one-off items, jumped to A$1.7 billion ($1.25 billion) in the quarter ended June as the lender moved funds previously set aside for potential COVID-19 losses back into cash accounts.
Like peers such as Commonwealth Bank, NAB bounced back quickly from the pandemic as record low interest rates and government spending boosted confidence and the housing market, rendering billions set aside in bad loan provisions unnecessary. 
But banks now face uncertainty again with fresh outbreaks of the Delta variant of COVID-19 triggering lockdowns across the country and fuelling concern that the world's 13th-biggest economy could slip back into recession.
NAB Chief Executive Ross McEwan on Thursday acknowledged the uncertainties, but said he remained optimistic about the long-term outlook for Australia and New Zealand.
""The strong economic growth leading into this period, ongoing government support and customers' relatively healthy starting positions give us confidence that once restrictions are eased, the economy will again bounce back,"" McEwan said.
That optimistic tone echoes the upbeat outlook issued on Wednesday by Commonwealth Bank, NBA's largest peer, which said it expects a quick dip in economic activity this year but strong growth in 2022.
As of July 31, NAB's deferred loan balances associated with lockdowns that started across major cities in the country earlier that month were less than A$1 billion, it said. 
Shares in NAB were 0.28% higher in late morning trading, slightly outperforming a flat broader market. 
The Melbourne-based lender, which agreed to buy  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)'s local consumer unit this week, said it wrote back credit impairment of A$112 million in the quarter, compared with bad debt charges of A$570 million last year.
It had sold a A$1.5 billion portfolio of aviation loans to ""de-risk"" its portfolio, it said.
NAB's common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio, a closely watched measure of spare cash, rose to 12.6% at end-June from 12.4% at end-March. 

That was expected to come down by 85 basis points after a A$2.5 billion share buy-back announced last month, and the purchase of Citi's Australian consumer unit.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning over signs that U.S. inflation is moderating and concerns over an earlier-than-expected asset tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve receded.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.21% by 10:09 PM ET (2:09 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.04%, with the country reporting a record 2,200 daily COVID-19 cases, health minister Deok-Cheol Kwon said on Wednesday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.01% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.33%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.11% while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.41%. Fears that the insurance technology platforms will be the latest to face tightened regulations grew after China’s Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission stepped up scrutiny of the sector. The People’s Bank of China also faced calls to cut interest rates as the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak threatens the economic recovery.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries pared gains after a strong auction and the latest U.S. inflation data. The core consumer price index (CPI) rose a lower-than-expected 0.3% month-on-month in July.
However, Fed officials offered differing views on the data’s implications for the central bank’s asset tapering timeline. Kansas City Fed President Esther George called for a move back towards pre-COVID-19 norms as the labor market is expected to continue its gains.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic was more cautious, saying that the Fed’s commitment to maximum employment means that interest rates will not be raised too quickly and that inflationary pressures seem to be temporary.
Some investors suggested that more data was needed to know whether inflationary pressure is beginning to recede.
“There is a lot being read into the month over month numbers, but one month does not make a trend,” Robertson Stephens Wealth Management chief economist Jeanette Garretty told Bloomberg, referring to the data.
“It is a little too early to say that this is conclusive evidence that we can see some of the heat on prices coming off. Some of the heat is off but not all of the heat is off.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said he believes more U.S. companies and organizations will begin requiring COVID-19 vaccinations, after a meeting with President Joe Biden on the topic on Wednesday.
""A few weeks from now, this is going to be something that's widespread across the country because it's really just a basic safety issue,"" Kirby told CNN after the meeting.
United is among a growing list of U.S. companies mandating shots for workers as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR soar in areas with low vaccination rates, mainly conservative states in the U.S. South.
Kirby said Biden had asked those at the 30-minute meeting about their vaccination efforts and encouraged them to persuade other business leaders to follow suit.
Alaska Airlines, which employs about 20,000 people, said separately that it was looking closely at whether it would require that its employees be vaccinated.
""If we do, the requirement would not be effective until at least one vaccine is fully approved by the FDA and would include appropriate religious and medical exemptions"", an Alaska Airlines spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Earlier, a White House official said Howard University President Wayne Frederick, Kaiser Permanente Chief Executive Gregory Adams and a South Carolina business owner who adopted a vaccinate-or-get-tested requirement for her workers would also attend the meeting.
Biden has endorsed companies and local governments pressing more people to get vaccinated. His administration is also looking into what authority businesses have to mandate vaccines, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told Reuters last week.
""I will have their backs and the backs of other private- and public-sector leaders if they take such steps,"" the Democratic president said last week.
United announced https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/united-airlines-makes-covid-19-shots-compulsory-us-employees-2021-08-06 its vaccine requirement for U.S.-based employees last week and Kirby said that while some had opposed the move, the overall response had been overwhelmingly positive. 
Mandating vaccines for passengers would be more difficult, he said, citing logistical challenges.
Its major U.S. rivals, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), are encouraging employee vaccinations but not imposing them.

U.S. airlines have enjoyed a broad rebound in travel demand this summer, but Southwest warned on Wednesday that rising COVID-19 cases were hitting demand, a sign of the impact of the Delta variant on the U.S. economy.
Among other transportation companies, U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak said on Wednesday it would require all of its 18,000 employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Nov. 1 or submit to weekly testing.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Two powerful proxy advisory firms support an activist investor's proposal to overhaul the financial structure at auto service company Monro Inc, according to reports seen by Reuters, paving the way for all shareholders to have a say on hot-button issues where one person now has veto power.
Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have urged shareholders in the $1.9 billion U.S. car service and tire centers company to approve a non-binding shareholder proposal made by hedge fund Ides Capital Management when they vote at next week's annual meeting.
Monro, publicly traded since 1991, has two share classes. Its Class C Preferred structure allows one board member, 82-year old investment banker Peter J. Solomon, to overrule votes from all other stockholders, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price. Solomon holds 100% of Monro's outstanding Class C Preferred shares which make up 0.06% of the total share count as of the record date. 
ISS and Glass Lewis wrote in reports seen by Reuters that shareholders' voting rights should match their economic interests, giving all Monro owners a say in decisions like who will sit on the board.
Getting rid of the dual class structure would ""create an even playing field for all shareholders, as well as a board that is more responsive to all shareholders,"" Glass Lewis wrote.
Ides said Monro's ""undemocratic and unequal voting rights"" hurt the company's stock price. It has been pressing Monro for months to improve returns and change operations. 
Monro's stock price has risen 7.41% since January and closed at $57.25 on Wednesday. Still, it has lagged the benchmark Russell 2000 index by 44.5% over the last year and by 95.6% over the last 10 years, Ides said in a regulatory filing.
A representative for Monro declined to comment.
""Monro is a textbook example of what can go wrong for corporate stakeholders when a board fails to uphold that principle,"" Dianne McKeever, Ides' chief investment officer said. ""We filed the recapitalization proposal in order to provide Monro’s long-suffering shareholders with an opportunity to speak for themselves on the Company's retrograde governance structure."" 
If the proposal passes, she said she would expect the board ""to take immediate action to uphold the majority will of Monro's true economic owners - its common shareholders.""
Dual share class structures often give founders more power and have long raised eyebrows among governance experts especially as they are becoming slightly more popular with many new technology companies incorporating them as they go public.
Often there is a provision for the structure to expire after several years, which has not happened at Monro.
""Many institutional investors support sunsets of seven years or less because academic research has found that the value premium that some dual-class companies have when they go public fades to a discount six to nine years after the IPO,"" said Amy Borrus, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed at record levels on Wednesday, as data indicated U.S. inflation growth may have peaked, while sectors tied to economic growth advanced on the heels of the passage of a large infrastructure bill.
The Labor Department said the consumer price index increased 0.5% last month after climbing 0.9% in June, the largest drop in month-to-month inflation in 15 months, easing concerns about the potential for runaway inflation.
""Certainly, the numbers show you more deceleration,"" said Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA LLC in New York. 
""This number is going to put the Fed in a little bit of a quandary because they've gone out with all this rhetoric about tapering, about tightening rates, about being defensive and the inflation numbers aren't quite where they should be, but they’re certainly not showing that this thing is out of control.""
Investors have been closely attuned to inflation pressures in recent months, concerned that a continual rise in prices could push the Federal Reserve to begin to scale down its ultra-accommodative policy stance earlier than anticipated.
Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said on Wednesday that with the U.S. economy growing at a robust pace, it signals the ""time has come to dial back the settings."" In addition, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said the central bank should announce its timeline to reduce its massive bondholding next month, with tapering to begin in October.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 221.22 points, or 0.63%, to 35,485.89, the S&P 500 gained 11.11 points, or 0.25%, to 4,447.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 23.91 points, or 0.16%, to 14,764.18.
After the U.S. Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package on Tuesday, an additional $3.5 trillion budget plan full of new domestic programs was also approved by the legislative body but disagreements within the Democratic party threatened the size and scope of the spending.
Shares of equipment maker  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) advanced and was the biggest boost to the Dow and peer Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co gained. Also moving higher were construction materials supplier Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) Co and steelmaker  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE), building on gains in the prior session on expectations of benefiting from infrastructure projects.
The materials and industrials were the best performing of the 11 major S&P sectors. 
Technology stocks moved off earlier lows in the wake of a strong 10-year note auction, which sent yields lower after a five day streak of gains session amid optimism about a stronger economic reopening.

For one, CAPEX in the energy sector remains quite low despite the rebound in price. Additionally, demand for oil and natural gas has proven to be quite resilient over the past year despite the shutdowns and decrease in economic activity. Therefore, investors should look to add the following energy stocks:  Oasis Petroleum  (NASDAQ:OAS), Apache Corporation (NASDAQ:APA), and Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR). .Since the stock market bottomed in March of last year, energy stocks have experienced a strong rebound. Of course, the biggest factor has been the sharp turnaround in oil and natural gas prices. This is largely due to demand returning to pre-coronavirus levels, while supply remains constrained.
As a result, energy stocks have also posted massive earnings beats on a year-over-year basis. Many energy stocks are cheaper than they were a year ago because their earnings have outpaced gains in their equity prices. And, this has become even more pronounced in recent weeks with the sell-off in energy stocks on concerns about growth slipping due to the outbreak in coronavirus cases with the Delta variant.
However, there are some compelling reasons to treat this dip as a buying opportunity. For one, CAPEX in the energy sector remains quite low despite the rebound in price.

(Reuters) -Three prominent allies of former U.S. President Donald Trump -Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell - on Wednesday lost a bid to dismiss multibillion dollar lawsuits saying their false claims about the 2020 presidential election defamed the Dominion voting equipment company.
U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington D.C. said in a written decision that lawsuits brought against the trio by Dominion Voting Systems should move forward. The company had said it was defamed because Trump and his supporters spread false claims that it rigged the election against him.
Nichols held that the First Amendment, which protects the right to free speech, offers ""no blanket immunity"" to Powell and Lindell in the lawsuits. Powell is a lawyer who later left the Trump campaign. Lindell is a conspiracy theorist who founded a pillow and bedding company.
The judge also rejected an argument by Giuliani, a former U.S. prosecutor and mayor of New York, that Dominion had not explained its request for money damages with enough specificity.
A Dominion spokesperson said: ""We are pleased to see this process moving forward to hold (the defendants) accountable.""
Howard Kleinhendler, a lawyer for Powell, said they were disappointed with the decision. ""However, we now look forward to litigating this case on its merits and proving that Ms. Powell’s statements were accurate and certainly not published with malice.""
Lawyers for Giuliani and Lindell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Dominion has sought $1.3 billion in damages from the three, who supported Trump's false claims that President Joe Biden could not have won the election in which the company's voting machines were used. 

Denver, Colorado-based Dominion has filed multiple lawsuits against Trump allies and conservative television networks, and has said it has not ruled out suing Trump. 
On Tuesday, Dominion filed defamation lawsuits against two conservative media networks, One America News Network and Newsmax Media Inc, for amplifying Trump's election fraud claims. In those cases, Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages from each network.

(Reuters) -Bumble Inc forecast current-quarter revenue above estimates on Wednesday as the pandemic-era surge in paying subscribers helped the dating app owner shrug off challenges posed by the COVID-19 Delta variant. 
Shares of Bumble jumped 3% in extended trading, as the Texas-based company also surpassed quarterly revenue estimates after total paying users rose 20% to 2.9 million. 
Apps like Bumble and Tinder grew last year as people isolated by lockdowns turned to virtual dating to reinvent romance. Now, with the Delta variant threatening a nascent recovery in the economy, investors are once again weighing how dating apps will fare.
Bumble said it is confident about its performance for the rest of the year, as it continued to see positive trends across platforms, ""even in some of the most affected markets.""
""When COVID accelerates and loneliness climbs, people turn to us for connections,"" Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd said on an earnings call. 
Herd added that Bumble saw increased engagement and activity in India too, even as the Delta variant rages across the country. 
The search for platonic relationships is also on the rise, encouraging companies such as Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH)'s Tinder and Bumble to double down on services that help users find and keep friends.
Data from research firm Apptopia showed that Bumble was downloaded about 2.05 million times in the United States during the second quarter, a rise of nearly 18% year-over-year.

Its second-quarter revenue rose 38% to $186.2 million, compared with Refinitiv IBES estimates of $178.7 million.
Bumble, which differentiates itself from competitors by requiring women to make the first move, said it expects current-quarter revenue between $195 million and $198 million, above expectations of $190.9 million.

(Reuters) -Autonomous driving startup Pony.ai has put on hold plans to go public in New York through a merger with a blank-check firm at a $12 billion valuation, after it failed to gain assurances from Beijing that it would not become a target of a crackdown against Chinese technology companies, people familiar with the matter said.
The decision makes Pony.ai one of the biggest companies to suspend its U.S. listing plans after China banned ride-sharing giant Didi Global Inc https://www.reuters.com/business/didi-shares-slump-25-china-crackdown-2021-07-06 from signing up new users just days after its blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) in June. 
It followed up with crackdowns on other Chinese technology firms over concerns about the safety of user data, which led to some companies, such as LinkDoc Technology and Hello Inc, scrapping their U.S. listing plans.
The  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp-backed startup will now seek to raise money in a private fundraising round at a valuation of $12 billion, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. It still hopes for a U.S. listing in the unlikely event it receives a green light from the Chinese government imminently, the sources added. 
Operating in both the United States and China, Pony.ai maintains a significant presence in Chinese cities including Beijing and Guangzhou, where it launched commuter pilots and signed partnerships with Chinese state-owned auto groups. 
It was concerned that the Chinese regulators could take action if it proceeded with a U.S. stock market debut, even through merging with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) instead of an IPO, the sources said. Details of Pony.ai's discussions with the Chinese authorities could not be learned.
ADVANCED SPAC TALKS
Pony.ai had been in exclusive talks to go public through a merger with VectoIQ Acquisition II. The deal would have been financed with a private placement from investors of roughly $1.2 billion, and the company had aimed to list by October, according to the sources. 
A spokesperson for Pony.ai said the company has no current plan or timeline to go public and declined to comment on the talks. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which has been leading the crackdown on technology companies such as Didi, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. VectoIQ declined to comment.
Had Pony.ai gone ahead with the listing, it would also have faced U.S scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said last month it would not allow Chinese companies to raise money in the United States unless they fully explain their legal structures and disclose the risk of Beijing interfering in their businesses.
The Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, which reviews deals of companies with foreign ties for potential national security risks, has also been scrutinizing SPAC deals.
Pony.ai CEO James Peng told Reuters in June that the company was considering going public in the United States to help fund its goal of commercializing driverless ride-hailing services. He provided no details of how this would happen.
SPACs, which raise money through their IPOs to buy private companies within a certain time frame, have become a popular way for self-driving tech companies to go public. 
In May, Plus, an autonomous truck company with operations and partnerships in China, clinched a deal to go public through a $3.3 billion merger with Hennessy Capital Investment Corp V , before China's technology crackdown. That deal is still expected to close by the third quarter. 
Pony.ai, which develops and tests its autonomous driving vehicles in the United States and China, said in November that its valuation reached $5.3 billion after raising more than $1 billion in funding.

In June, the company hired Lawrence Steyn, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), as its chief financial officer to prepare for a public listing.
VectoIQ II is the second SPAC to be led by former General Motors (NYSE:GM) Vice Chairman Steve Girsky, whose first SPAC struck a deal with electric truck maker Nikola Corp. It raised $345 million in an oversubscribed IPO in January.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 06:25PM ET</span>","Lordstown eyes contract manufacturing, leasing space at its Ohio plant","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -Lordstown Motors Corp, which previously warned it needs to raise additional funding, hung the ""open for business"" sign on its northeastern Ohio plant on Wednesday, saying it was in talks to build vehicles for other automakers or lease space in the factory.
Shares of the electric vehicle startup, which also said it will begin limited production of its Endurance pickup truck in late September, rose 6.1% in after-hours trading. 
""We are exploring multiple partnership constructs. That includes contract manufacturing, that includes licensing,"" Chairwoman Angela Strand said on a conference call with analysts. ""We're discussing with multiple (automakers) who are interested in exploring how they can leverage the assets that we have.""
""This is a critical, strategic pivot for us,"" she added. ""A decision that we believe will lead to significant new revenue opportunities."" 
Lordstown, which also on Wednesday announced a second-quarter loss, said its plant in the northeastern part of the state is ready and that retooling of stamping, assembly, body and paint shops has been completed. It also said the electric battery line is fully commissioned.
Lordstown will begin shipping the Endurance to select early customers in the first quarter of next year, followed by wider commercial deliveries in the second quarter, she said. Production will increase steeply in the second half of 2022.
Strand said while Lordstown will initially target commercial customers, the Endurance also will appeal to consumers.
Lordstown President Rich Schmidt said the Endurance uses only 30% of the plant's 6.2 million square feet, so there is room for others to build vehicles there or for Lordstown to build them. Other options could include selling batteries or EV platforms to other automakers, he said.
Lordstown on Wednesday said it lost just over $108 million, or 61 cents a share, in the second quarter. 
The company had $366 million in cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter, and expected to end the third quarter with liquidity of between $225 million and $275 million excluding any funds from a capital raise.
Last month, Lordstown said a hedge fund had committed to purchasing up to $400 million of the startup's shares over a three-year period. Executives said on Wednesday that Lordstown was exploring other financing options, including debt.
Lordstown also will begin earning environmental credits it can sell to other automakers, interim Chief Financial Officer Becky Roof said. It has a deal with minority shareholder General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) that allows the No. 1 U.S. automaker to buy those credits during the first three full production years at a discount to fair market value.
Lordstown faces heightened scrutiny from federal prosecutors in Manhattan and officials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to its merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and statements it previously made about preorders for its vehicles.

In March, Lordstown's shares slumped after Hindenburg Research disclosed it had taken a short position on the stock, saying the company had misled investors.
An internal investigation into Hindenburg's claims in June found that Lordstown had overstated the quality of preorders. Lordstown also announced at the same time the resignation of founder and chief executive Steve Burns, the company's largest shareholder.

In the past year, customers turned to e-commerce platforms during the coronavirus pandemic as they were home-bound for months at a stretch, but vaccine rollouts are expected to lead a return to brick-and-mortar shopping as more people step out of their homes.
EBay said it expects third-quarter revenue in the range of $2.42 billion to $2.47 billion, while analysts were expecting $2.92 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Shares of the e-commerce firm fell 1% after the bell.
Jamie Iannone, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)'s chief executive, said an increase in people on the move in the spring had impacted sales, but the company's playbook in areas such as collectibles, ads and payments was working.
""We feel like we're coming out of the pandemic stronger than we came into it,"" he said in an interview.
He said that excluding eBay's deal to sell 80% of its Korea business to Shinsegae Group's E-Mart Inc, the company met or exceeded forecasts.
Last month, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s second-quarter revenue missed analysts' estimates, and the company hinted at slower sales growth in the e-commerce sphere.
EBay said its second-quarter revenue rose about 14% to $2.68 billion, its slowest growth in four quarters. Analysts expected sales of $3.00 billion.
The company's gross merchandise volume (GMV), which is the value of goods sold on its websites within a certain time frame, fell 7% to $22.1 billion.
The company expects to see an additional drop in active buyers on a rolling 12-month basis, but an increase in GMV per buyer in the coming quarters, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Priest said on a post-earnings call.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned 99 cents per share, above analysts' estimate of 95 cents.
EBay has also expanded its share buyback program by $3 billion.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) backed electric vehicle (EV) company Rivian is in discussions to invest at least $5 billion in a new vehicle plant near Fort Worth, Texas, a city document showed.
The Fort Worth offer is part of a larger bidding war by state and local officials, particularly in the southern United States, as newer players take on incumbents in a race to develop EVs.
The factory, described in the document as ""Project Tera"", would create at least 7,500 jobs by 2027 and produce around 200,000 vehicles a year. The plant would be located on a 2,000 acre site west of Fort Worth, the presentation by the city's economic development department showed.
Workers at the factory would earn a minimum average annual salary of $56,000, according to the document.
California-based Rivian in a statement said it was in discussions with multiple locations as part of a competitive process for what would be its second U.S. factory, but added that those processes did not indicate a final decision.
Bloomberg first reported on the Fort Worth discussions.
To attract the Rivian bid, the city offers grants and tax abatements of up to $440 million, with the document stating that known competitors for the site offer aggressive incentives.
""Incentives (are) important to (the) final decision process,"" the document says.
Sources previously told Reuters the new factory would include battery cell production, and that it could break ground next year.
Rivian is also considering land east of Mesa, Arizona, near Gold Canyon, for its new EV plant. 
""I'd recommend they get their first plant working. It's insanely difficult to reach volume production at affordable unit cost,"" Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Elon Musk said in a tweet. 

The Arizona site likely remained Rivian's preferred location, a second source familiar with the discussions said, but said big incentives from rival sites are ""intoxicating – especially if you've never done a project this big.""
EV maker Tesla last year secured tax rebates worth around $65 million for its new vehicle and battery plant in Austin, Texas.

Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) is a combination of blot clots and low platelet levels which has been labelled as a rare side effect of the viral vector COVID vaccines made by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
A higher occurrence of the side-effect in younger people has led to many countries to put age restrictions on AstraZeneca's shot.
Around 85% of those who suffered rare blood clots after vaccination with AstraZeneca's COVID-19 shot in Britain were under 60 even though more of the shots were given to the elderly, the study found, in one of the fullest characterisations of the syndrome so far.
It found that in those aged under 50, incidence was around 1 in 50,000, in line with previous estimates, and experts said the study reinforced prior understanding of risk-benefit calculation of vaccination.
Sue Pavord, a consultant haematologist at Oxford University Hospitals who led the research, said the incident usually affected young people who were otherwise healthy, and was especially dangerous if it resulted in bleeding in the brain.
But she added that an initial spike of cases of the side-effect had subsided as the impact of Britain's decision to offer under-40s alternative shots in May filtered through.
""We haven't seen new cases for the last four weeks or so and this has been a tremendous relief,"" she told reporters.
The condition had an overall mortality rate of 23%, but that rose to 73% in cases with clots in the brain known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), though treatments like blood plasma exchange increased the survival rate for severe cases to 90%.
The researchers said they hoped the study would inform vaccination strategy but emphasised the importance of getting vaccinated, especially given much higher rates of other types of clots in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
The paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
Out of 294 possible cases analysed, 220 were found to be definite or possible cases of VITT, all of which followed the AstraZeneca rather than the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine. 

Multiple clots were found in around one-third of cases, and almost all those hospitalised with the condition experienced it between five to 30 days after a first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine. 
J&J's single-shot vaccine is not being rolled out in Britain.

Armin Laschet, the conservative candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor, is scheduled to visit Tesla's site, located in Gruenheide near Berlin, on Friday to meet with local staff as part of his election campaign.
Due to environmental resistance and red tape, it remains unclear when the first vehicles will roll off the production line at the site.
Tesla has already pushed back the expected opening to late 2021. The environmental agency in Brandenburg has yet to give final approval - meaning a further delay cannot be ruled out, even into 2022.

Musk has regularly travelled to Germany to check on the plant's progress and during a visit in May criticised Germany's bureaucracy.
""It's gonna be awesome,"" Musk said on Twitter https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1425512837301080079 on Wednesday in response to a tweet that cited an article saying that public opposition to the plant was declining.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 05:10PM ET</span>",U.S. House Democrats seek at least $160 billion in new EV funding,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of 29 U.S. House Democrats want congressional leaders to include at least $160 billion in additional funding for electric vehicles as part of a $3.5 trillion spending measure, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
A bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill includes $7.5 billion for electric vehicle charging stations and some other EV-related funding estimated at $2.5 billion to $5.5 billion.
President Joe Biden in March called for $174 billion in total spending on electric vehicles, including $100 billion in consumer incentives and $15 billion to build 500,000 EV charging stations.
The previously unreported letter dated Wednesday said Congress should ensure at least $174 billion in total EV funding ""including light-duty consumer incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets.""
They also want to ensure that ""no less than 40% of the investments go to disadvantaged communities.""
Representative Doris Matsui, who helped lead the letter, cited a U.N. climate panel report this week that found global warming is dangerously close to spiraling out of control.
""Robust EV investments are critical to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, and we must be willing to take bold steps to build a better future,"" she said.
On Tuesday, a separate group of Democratic lawmakers said they wanted $85 billion for electric vehicle charging efforts.
The push faces opposition from Republicans. On Tuesday, the Senate voted 51-48 in support of a non-binding amendment to prohibit taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 a year or if the vehicles cost more than $40,000.
Republican Senator Deb Fischer, the amendment's author, questioned ""why we're subsidizing this industry at all"" and said lawmakers should deny ""taxpayer subsidies for the rich.""
A Senate panel in May voted to expand the credit to up to$12,500, limiting credits to vehicles below $80,000. 
Michigan Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow opposed Fischer's amendment calling it ""anti-pickup truck."" She said the price ceiling would mean EV pickups would not be eligible for credits.

The current maximum tax credit is $7,500 with no maximum vehicle price and phases out for individual automakers once they hit 200,000 total EVs sold.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV, in a joint statement last week said they aspired ""to achieve sales of 40%-50% of annual U.S. volumes of electric vehicles... by 2030.""

Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $99.75 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Financial technology companies like Marqeta have gained from an uptick in virtual transactions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has boosted online spending on shopping and food deliveries. 

The company's net loss widened to $68.55 million, or 29 cents per share for the quarter, from $7.1 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier, due to higher employee-related costs. 
Marqeta, which provides payments services to customers including Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and DoorDash Inc, reported its earnings for the first time after making its stock market debut in June.

Traveling from Kenya's airport to its city center by EVA could reduce travel time from over an hour to six minutes, according to a news release from Embraer.

""The creation of disruptive and accessible solutions in urban air mobility will help democratize movement,"" Andre Stein, president and chief executive of Eve, said in the release.
In June, Eve entered into merger talks with blank-check company Zanite Acquisition Corp. The same month, U.S. electric aircraft maker Vertical Aerospace announced it would go public through a merger with Broadstone Acquisition Corp in a deal expected to close in the second half of 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global shares hit record highs Wednesday after data showed U.S. consumer price increases slowed in July, easing concerns that the Federal Reserve will imminently signal a scaling back of bond purchases.
The data showed tentative signs inflation had peaked as supply-chain disruptions work their way through the U.S. economy.
""This is a more moderate reading than expected, especially on the core,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.
Speculation is growing that Fed Chair Jerome Powell will signal timings on tapering stimulus at a meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 26-28. 
Stronger-than-expected inflation data may have fueled talk of an imminent slowing of the Fed's bond purchases, said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe.
""Instead, we can all breathe a little easier, albeit safe in the knowledge that tapering is still coming and it's likely to be announced next month,"" he said.
U.S. nonfarm payrolls figures due in September could also influence tapering if they are particularly strong.
The MSCI all-country index, a gauge of stocks across the globe, hit a record high and was last trading up 0.29%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P500 both closed at record highs, with sentiment boosted by U.S. lawmakers approving a trillion-dollar infrastructure package on Tuesday.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Dow notched record highs again Wednesday as investor optimism over the economy continues to grow at a time when inflation is showing signs of peaking. and lawmakers on Capitol Hill continue to make progress on plans to boost infrastructure spending. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.3% to clinch an all-time closing high of 4,447.60. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%, or 220 points, to close at a record of 35,484.97. The Nasdaq was down 0.2%.
The consumer price index rose 0.5% in July, as expected, ending a string of the four-straight monthly upside surprises. On an annualized basis, consumer prices rose 5.4% in July, slightly higher than expected. Still, the sign of the cooling price pressures has eased fears of runaway inflation.
“For now, the streak of outsized inflation surprises is over,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. “However, it remains to be seen whether the period of elevated price pressures is truly over.”
U.S. Treasury yields retreated from highs following the inflation report, and suffered a further fall on signs of strong demand for the U.S. bonds. The $41 billion auction in 10-year Treasury notes on Wednesday was well received, with a bid-to-cover ratio that was the highest since May 2020, pointing to strong demand for the benchmark index at time when other sovereign bonds continue to yield negative returns.
The fall in yields didn’t stop the ascent in banking stocks, which have been steadily racking up gains recently.   Citigroup (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were up more than 1%, pushing the broader financials higher.
Sentiment on stocks was also given a lift following further progress on the $1 trillion infrastructure bill.
After voting to pass the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which aims to improve the nation’s transportation, internet access and other projects, the Senate also passed a resolution to move ahead with a $3.5 trillion proposal focused on human infrastructure including health care and education.
Both bills have now moved to the House, but the fate of the smaller bipartisan infrastructure bill will depend on successful passage of the $3.5 trillion package. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested that the $3.5 trillion bill will need to be passed before the House will vote on the infrastructure bill.
Energy stocks bounced from session lows, building on a jump from a day earlier as oil prices advanced after the White House called on OPEC and its allies to boost production to support the global economic recovery.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday threw its weight behind a proposed rule change that would require banks and other debit card issuers to provide multiple network options to merchants to route online purchases.
The move, made in a comment letter filed to the Federal Reserve by the DOJ's Antitrust Division, underlines the Biden's administrations renewed efforts to bolster the government's antitrust efforts.
""We commend the Board for its efforts to promote competition in this important part of the debit card industry,"" Richard Powers, acting assistant attorney general for the antitrust division, said in a statement. ""There is limited competition to process online and other card-not-present debit transactions — which in 2019 accounted for over $1 trillion in transaction value.""
In July, President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing government agencies to crack down on anticompetitive behavior across a range of industries, including banking.
The rise of online commerce spurred the Fed to revisit its 2011 ""interchange"" rule in May, reproposing a portion to ensure debit card providers offer multiple networks to merchants for transactions where the card is not physically present. The Justice Department says that move could ultimately lower costs for consumers.
Reuters previously reported the Justice Department had been investigating  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) for anticompetitive practices in the debit-card market, including directing merchants to pricier networks to route transactions.

Rules around so-called ""swipe fees"" have been a fierce lobbying battle ground for banks and major retailers ever since the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law directed the Fed to cap how much banks could charge to process a transaction.
When the Fed announced it was revisiting the rule, several large bank lobbying groups said in a joint statement the policy has been ""flawed from the beginning"" and trying to revisit it ""risks causing even further consumer harm.""

The company joined New York Stock Exchange and NBCUniversal in adopting a vaccination policy on Wednesday as a result of the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States due to the Delta variant. 
In recent weeks, major companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said all their U.S. employees must get vaccinated to step into offices after new guidance from U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that requires fully vaccinated individuals to wear masks.
McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) said in an internal note obtained by Reuters it was pushing back office reopening to Oct. 11 from Sept. 7 to allow employees time to get vaccinated.
The company said the vaccination requirement does not apply to employees of McDonald's restaurants, whether corporate-owned and franchised.
The New York Stock Exchange said it will require anyone accessing its trading floor at 11 Wall Street to be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus as of Sept. 13, according to a memo to the floor community seen by Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bipartisan trio of senators introduced a bill that would rein in app stores of companies they said exert too much market control, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar teamed up with Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn to sponsor the bill, which would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use their payment system. It would also prohibit them from punishing apps that offer different prices or conditions through another app store or payment system.
""I found this predatory abuse of Apple and Google so deeply offensive on so many levels,"" Blumenthal said in an interview Wednesday. ""Their power has reached a point where they are impacting the whole economy in stifling and strangling innovation.""
Blumenthal said he expected companion legislation in the House of Representatives ""very soon.""
The stakes are high for Apple, whose App Store anchors its $53.8 billion services business as the smartphone market has matured.
Apple said its app store was ""an unprecedented engine of economic growth and innovation, one that now supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states.""
Google declined to comment, but a spokeswoman cited previous company statements that Android devices often come preloaded with two or more app stores and that app sellers can allow downloads without using Google's Play Store.
The bill won praise from Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Epic and Tile. Tile, which makes tags to find lost objects, complained earlier this year about Apple launching a rival product.
A similar law revision has been introduced in South Korea. Google said last year it would enforce certain in-app payment methods there and receive 30% commission fees from non-game digital content.

Apple's control over apps on its Store, and 15% to 30% commissions on digital sales have come under regulatory scrutiny. A federal judge is reviewing testimony to rule on an antitrust lawsuit by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games.
Epic also sued Google for its app store practices, as have a big group of state attorneys general alleging that it unlawfully worked to maintain a monopoly for its app store for Android phones.

Investing.com -- Relatively tame data on inflation for July and the prospect of more government spending on infrastructure for the next few years sent stocks on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average roaring to new highs on Wednesday.
In the morning, data on consumer prices in July mostly met expectations and eased concerns that the Federal Reserve would act more quickly to tighten policy by easing off the bond buying activity that has helped the economy snap back from the pandemic. 
The Senate has sent two spending plans, a $1 trillion bill on infrastructure and another $3.5 trillion budget including President Joe Biden’s antipoverty and climate initiatives, on for consideration in the House. 
Nothing is guaranteed, but the ability of a divided Senate to at least get something on the table cheered sentiment.
The legislative efforts are lifting stocks of equipment makers, materials suppliers, steelmakers and other industrial, energy and manufacturing stocks. 
On the commodities front, oil prices rose Wednesday, but the gain was partly held back by disappointing inventory data, which showed less of a drawdown than expected. 
President Biden put pressure on the oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia and its allies to boost production, which would lower gas prices and take pressure off American household pocketbooks. 
Jobless claims data for last week and producer price inflation are due out tomorrow. Here are three things that also could affect the markets.
1. Hospitality reading
Travel stock Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) is expected to announce a second-quarter loss per share of 36 cents on revenue of $1.26 billion.

Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) is expected to clock revenue of $16.76 billion and EPS of 54 cents in the third quarter. Analysts will be listening to the management’s outlook on theme parks and for any updates on the progress of its Disney+ streaming business, which has burst onto the scene since the pandemic forced studios to release new films in a less-than-traditional way.

The new rules come as concerns over the Delta variant have prompted some companies to delay a return to office, with health officials recently calling for reinstating indoor mask mandates for most vaccinated Americans.
Effective immediately, the NYSE will expand its onsite random testing program to include vaccinated personnel, the exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc, said. 

As of Sept. 13, everyone who accesses the trading floor, including employees of member firms, NYSE employees and vendors, must be fully vaccinated, the NYSE said.
Exemptions can be made for qualifying medical or religious reasons, the exchange added, but prior to entering the floor, those with exemptions will have to show proof of a negative COVID test and wear face coverings at all times.

However, Taylor Dart believes it could be an opportunity to buy shares of high-quality companies like Kirkland Lake Gold (NYSE:KL),  B2Gold  (NYSE:BTG), and Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM).It’s been a rough start to August thus far for the Gold Miners Index (GDX (NYSE:GDX)), with the ETF sliding 9% in the last ten trading sessions. This has pushed the ETF into deeply negative territory for the year, with many poorly operated names dragging down the index. Given gold’s (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) poor performance as an inflation hedge in a clear inflationary environment, many investors have finally begun to throw in the towel on both miners and gold. This has created an opportunity for those looking for exposure to the sector. In this update, we’ll look at three names that are top buy-the-dip candidates among the sector-wide carnage:
(Source: TC2000.com)
The favored way for investors to get exposure to gold is through the Gold Miners Index, but the issue is that investors are also exposed to the dogs of the sector and get a much lower yield. These under-performers weigh on the GDX’s performance, and with the GDX owning over 50 names, it’s bound to hold several names with major operational and financial issues. This is why I prefer investing in individual miners. However, the key is to focus on the highest-quality names with the best business and be disciplined enough to wait for the right price. With three top miners now paying dividend yields of 2% or higher and trading at double-digit earnings yields, now looks like the time to begin starting new positions in names like Kirkland Lake Gold (KL) and B2Gold (BTG) and monitor for further weakness in Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM). Let’s take a closer look at the three companies below:

While the passage of an infrastructure bill in the Senate yesterday shifted investors’ focus to cyclical stocks, the reimposition of social distancing norms should drive the tech industry’s performance in the near term. Thus, we believe tech stocks  SPS Commerce  (NASDAQ:SPSC), Nova (NVMI), Methode Electronics (NYSE:MEI), and  OSI Systems  (NASDAQ:OSIS) should reach fresh highs soon. Let’s evaluate these names more closely.The resurgence of COVID-19 infections due to the Delta variant’s spread has renewed investor interest in tech stocks. Furthermore, the ongoing digital transformation of virtually every industry has highlighted the importance of technology over the past few months. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has gained 10.9% over the past three months, outperforming the broader S&P 500 index’s 5.8% returns.
The big infrastructure bill recently passed in the U.S. Senate has switched investors’ focus to cyclical stocks. Nevertheless, concerns regarding the resurgence of COVID-19 cases are expected to boost investments in tech stocks in the near term.
Given this backdrop, we think surging tech stocks SPS Commerce, Inc. (SPSC), Nova Ltd. (NVMI), Methode Electronics, Inc. (MEI), and OSI Systems, Inc. (OSIS) could hit fresh price highs soon.

For instance, fundamentally sound companies Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Linde (NYSE:LIN), and Starbucks (SBUX) have increased their dividends over the past few years. So, it could be wise to bet on these stocks now. So, let’s take a closer look at these names.The major stock market indexes have been hovering near their all-time highs lately, led primarily by solid second-quarter earnings reports and the news of a substantial decline in the unemployment rate. However, market volatility still lingers, with several parts of the world witnessing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases due to the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant.
Moreover, concerns about high inflation could fuel stock market volatility in the near term. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that inflation could be persistent. As a countermeasure, the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as early 2023, but timing regarding the central bank’s tapering activities is still uncertain.
Amid this environment, investors could turn toward dividend-paying stocks to hedge their portfolios against short-term market volatility by ensuring a steady income stream. So, we think it could be wise to scoop up the shares of Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Linde plc (LIN), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) on their fundamental strength and history of increasing dividends.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a Chinese court's sentencing of Canadian businessman Michael Spavor to 11 years in prison for espionage on Wednesday was ""absolutely unacceptable"" and called for his immediate release.
The ruling comes as Huawei Technologies CFO Meng Wanzhou's U.S. extradition hearings have entered the final stretch in a Canadian court, a case that cast a chill over diplomatic ties between Beijing and Ottawa.
Here is a timeline of Meng's extradition case.
AUG. 22, 2018: A New York court issues an arrest warrant for Meng to stand trial in the United States.
DEC. 1, 2018: Meng is arrested by Canadian police in Vancouver as she changes planes. The arrest is not made public until Dec. 5. The Chinese embassy in Canada demands her release.
DEC. 6, 2018: Chinese officials say they have not been given a reason for Meng's arrest. The White House and Trudeau both move to distance themselves from the arrest.
DEC. 7, 2018: Court proceedings show that the United States issued the arrest warrant because it believes Meng covered up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions against the country.
DEC. 8, 2018: China threatens Canada with consequences if it does not release Meng.
DEC. 10, 2018: Two Canadians Michael Kovrig and Spavor are arrested in China.
DEC. 11, 2018: Meng is released on bail to house arrest in Vancouver by a British Columbia court. U.S. President Donald Trump tells Reuters he will intervene in the case if it would serve national interests.
JAN. 8, 2019: Documents found by Reuters confirm Huawei's links to companies suspected of operating in Iran and Syria, breaking sanctions.
JAN. 22, 2019: The U.S. Justice Department announces it will formally seek the extradition of Meng to the United States.
JAN. 26, 2019: Trudeau fires John McCallum, Canada's ambassador to China, after he tells Chinese-language media Huawei can make a good case against extradition, thanks in part to Trump's comments about his willingness to get involved.
FEB. 4, 2019: Canadian canola shipments are delayed in China.
MARCH 1, 2019: Canada approves the extradition order of Meng to the United States.
MARCH 3, 2019: Huawei sues the Canadian government over Meng's arrest.
MARCH 6, 2019: China says it found ""hazardous pests"" in Canadian canola samples and blocks most shipments of the crop.
JUNE 25, 2019: China blocks all pork shipments from Canada.
JULY 15, 2019: Canada postpones decision on whether to allow Huawei to build a 5G network in Canada.
MAY 27, 2020: A British Columbia Supreme Court judge rules the charges against Meng met the legal standard of double criminality, meaning they could be considered crimes in both the United States and Canada.
JUNE 19, 2020: China charges two detained Canadians with suspected espionage.
AUG. 25, 2020: The Canadian court blocks Meng's lawyers push for the release of further documents relating to her arrest.
SEPT. 28, 2020: Hearings begin on whether to allow Meng to add a new allegation of abuse of process to the case.
OCT. 8, 2020: British Columbia Supreme Court judge mostly agrees with Canada that Meng does not have the right to more disclosures, with the exception of a portion of one email.
OCT. 26, 2020: Cross-examination of witnesses on the second branch of abuse of process starts.
NOV. 16, 2020: A further two weeks of witness cross examination starts, during which Canadian border agents testified defending their decision to first interrogate Meng before letting the federal police arrest her. Huawei's lawyers questioned the witnesses on the circumstances surrounding her initial interrogation and claimed the federal police violated her rights by passing identifying details of Meng's electronic devices to U.S. authorities.

AUG. 4, 2021: Meng returns to the courtroom for the final weeks of her hearings, which will initially focus on the third part of her lawyers' arguments, specifically that U.S. prosecutors materially misrepresented the case against her in their extradition request to Canada.
AUG. 10, 2021: A Chinese court sentences Canadian businessman Michael Spavor to 11 years in prison for espionage.

(Reuters) - A U.S. bidding battle could be brewing for UK aerospace engineer  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT), which has been approached by TransDigm over a possible 7.03 billion pound ($9.74 billion) offer, days after accepting a lower bid from Parker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH).
Meggitt, a supplier of aerospace components including wheels and brakes for military fighters, announced TransDigm's overture on Wednesday, saying the possible offer of 900 pence per share from the U.S. player was preliminary and non-binding. 
Nonetheless, that topped an 800 pence per share proposal from Parker last week. Meggitt said it continued to back Parker's 6.3 billion pound proposal, but said it would also review TransDigm's potential offer.
News of the approach from Ohio-based TransDigm, which makes aircraft components and systems used in commercial and military aircraft, sent shares of London-listed Meggitt to a fresh record high of 846 pence before closing at 830 pence.
Meggitt shares, which lost nearly 30% in value last year, have gained 77% since the Parker deal was announced last week. 
""Meggitt believes Parker's offer continues to represent an attractive proposition for Meggitt's shareholders and for its broader stakeholders,"" said the company, based in Coventry, central England.
TransDigm's plans for Meggitt and the potential impact on the company's employees, pension schemes and customers along with the British government and other regulatory bodies would be considered carefully, the British firm added.
Meggitt employs over 9,000 people in 14 countries across the defence, aerospace and energy sectors. 
PARKER'S COMMITMENTS
Parker, which is also based in Ohio, and operates in industrial and aerospace markets, has made a series of commitments to the British government on jobs and security.
Analysts have said that it was unlikely that the government would block Meggitt's deal with Parker, given the suitor's proposed safeguards.
U.S.-listed shares of Parker were down 1.2%, while TransDigm was marginally up by 1627 GMT.
TransDigm's move marks the latest interest from a U.S. company for a British defence group. Cobham, which was bought by U.S. private equity firm Advent last year, made a $3.6 billion offer to buy UK-based rival Ultra Electronics last month, for instance.
The Ultra proposal has attracted the attention https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-ma-cobham-idUSL1N2P21N4 of the British government. 
Takeovers for British companies hit a 14-year high by value in the first seven months of 2021, driven by relatively cheap valuations due in part to the pandemic and Brexit.
UK drugmaker Vectura is in the middle of a takeover battle between New York-based tobacco giant Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) and Washington-based private equity firm Carlyle.

Global M&A hit $3.6 trillion so far this year, an all-time year-to-date high, with the United States driving activity, according to data provider Refinitiv https://thesource.refinitiv.com/thesource/getfile/index/41afdcdb-6615-4026-baa8-906de1767bfd.

(Reuters) -Southwest Airlines Co warned on Wednesday that the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 had hit bookings and increased cancellations, hurting its chances at profitability this quarter.
The rapid surge in cases of the variant has pushed U.S. hospitalizations to a six-month high, prompting governments in areas such as Hawaii to reimpose restrictions and threatening a recovery in travel demand.
Dallas-based Southwest cut its forecast for third-quarter operating revenue by three to four percentage points from its prior outlook issued just three weeks ago, the first major U.S. carrier to trim guidance as a result of the variant.
The profit-warning marked a U-turn from the airline's upbeat statement last month that it would remain profitable for the rest of 2021.
Last week, ultra-low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines also lowered its third-quarter forecast and warned the Delta variant was hurting demand.
While analysts expect other airlines to also revise guidance lower, Raymond James analysts noted expectations that new coronavirus cases may be peaking and soon begin a downward trajectory.
Shares of Southwest opened lower but were flat in morning trade. They have risen 9.7% this year on hopes of a recovery in travel demand, but underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index's 18.1% rise.
The carrier maintained its unit cost outlook for the quarter.

Southwest had been one of the biggest beneficiaries of easing coronavirus curbs as it mainly caters to the domestic market.
But its home base of Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott has banned mask mandates and opposed COVID-19-related business restrictions, is among the U.S. states with the highest increases in new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.

A day after Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union announced Armin Laschet, the party’s chairman, will pay Tesla’s unfinished car and battery factory a visit on Aug. 13, Musk’s jet took off Wednesday from Tuscany, Italy, and is headed for the German capital, according to a Twitter account that tracks the movement of his plane.
CDU officials said they are not aware of a possible Musk appearance. A representative for Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Germany’s next chancellor will come under pressure to accelerate the pace of technological progress to ensure Europe’s biggest economy modernizes and remains competitive in the digital age. While the country scored a major victory when Musk announced plans to construct a plant in Gruenheide, the project has fallen months behind schedule, with Tesla bemoaning an “irritating” process of obtaining regulatory approvals.
Although still the election front-runner, Laschet and the conservative bloc have had a rocky few weeks. The CDU’s lead over the Greens has shrunk in recent polls.

Investing.com –  Carvana  stock (NYSE:CVNA) fell 3% Wednesday after being barred from selling cars in North Carolina’s Raleigh area until January.
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, a state investigation determined that it failed to deliver titles to the motor vehicle department and sold cars without state inspections.
The state motor vehicles department has revoked the used car dealer’s license for its Wake County location. According to the WSJ report, the company has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $500 and an administrative hearing fee of $200, according to court documents.
The penalty was part of an agreement Carvana reached with state officials.
Carvana’s business of selling used cars has boomed in the pandemic as chip shortage has held back production of new cars and thus forced buyers to look at purchases of second-hand vehicles.
The June-quarter net profit was the company’s first ever. June-quarter revenue of $3.33 billion was also the first time the company crossed the $3-billion mark, almost trebling from $1.11 billion in the same period last year.
Net income was $45 million, up from a loss of $106 million in the prior-year period. Retail sales also touched a record and almost doubled to 107,815 units from 55,098 units in the June quarter of 2020.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. online bank Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) has agreed to backstop home insurance policies provided by Hippo Holdings Inc, providing capital for the latter to generate more business, the companies told Reuters. 
Hippo will underwrite the policies and sell them to consumers, while Ally will assume the risk for them and put aside the cash to back them - some $500 million to begin with. The agreement will double Hippo's underwriting capacity and leave it with more money to invest in improving its technology and services, its President Rick McCathron said in a recent interview. 
""As we are a fast-growing company, it's very important for us to have plenty of underwriting capacity to support our growth,"" McCathron said. 
The Ally-backed policies will be offered in ten states under the partnership before being rolled out nationally, the companies said.
""This relationship complements and diversifies the ongoing expansion of Ally's insurance business,"" Mark Manzo, Ally's president of insurance, said in a statement. 
Ally's insurance offering had so far been limited to insurance for the auto industry. McCathron said there was potential for further collaboration with Ally, without providing details.

The partnership comes a week after Hippo began trading on the New York Stock Exchange following the completion of its merger with a blank-check acquisition firm backed by Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus, the co-founders of LinkedIn and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) respectively.
Hippo will also announce on Wednesday a fronting carrier agreement with Austin, Texas-based insurance services provider Incline P&C Group, which will offer Incline's customers access to Hippo's home protection and maintenance services.

(Reuters) -Pregnant women should be vaccinated against COVID-19, based on a new analysis that did not show increased risk for miscarriage, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday.
The CDC said it has found no safety concerns for pregnant people in either the new analysis or earlier studies. It said miscarriage rates after vaccination were similar to the expected rate. Pregnant women can receive any of the three vaccines given emergency authorization --  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
The agency had not previously recommended pregnant women get vaccinated but had said that they should discuss vaccination with their health care providers.
Sascha Ellington, team lead for the Emergency Preparedness and Response team in CDC's Division of Reproductive Health, said that vaccine uptake in pregnant women has been low, with only 23% receiving at least one vaccine dose.
""We want to increase that,"" Ellington said, noting that the agency was working on strategies to have obstetricians and gynecologists become vaccine providers. ""We want women to be protected. We're not seeing any safety signals and so the benefits of vaccination really do outweigh any potential or unknown risks.""
Pregnancy increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19, according to the CDC, and COVID-19 during pregnancy increases the risk for preterm birth.
The CDC said it now recommends all people 12 years and older get vaccinated against COVID-19, including people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant or might become pregnant in the future.

""We are aware of the myths that have been spreading related to fertility. They are not based on any evidence. There's no science that backs that up,"" Ellington said. ""We hope this helps.""
The new guidance comes as cases and hospitalizations https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR have surged across the country in the past month. Some hospitals in Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi have run out of beds, and the outbreak is spreading beyond the epicenter in the U.S. South to Oregon and Washington state.

Investing.com – Accenture stock (NYSE:ACN) dipped 0.8% Wednesday as the consulting company downplayed a ransomware attack by a hacker group.
The group, using Lockbit ransomware, said it had hacked the firm’s systems and will release the data in several hours.
According to ZDNet, Accenture downplayed the incident. There was no impact on Accenture's operations, or on Accenture's clients' systems, as per the ZDNet report.
LockBit is a ransomware variant first detected in September 2019. The LockBit ransomware restricts access to corporate files and systems by encrypting them into an unusable format. Victims receive instructions on how to engage with the offenders after encryption.
The Australian Cyber Security Centre released an advisory on Friday noting that after a brief lull, the Lockbit ransomware group has ramped up attacks.
According to Accenture’s own report, released August 4, global cyber intrusion activity more than doubled in first half of 2021.
From an industry perspective, consumer goods and services was targeted the most, accounting for 21% of cyberattacks, followed by industrial/manufacturing, banking, and travel & hospitality industries, at 16%, 10% and 9%, respectively.
Companies with annual revenue between $1 billion and $9.9 billion accounted for more than half (54%) of ransomware and extortion victims, followed by companies with annual revenue between $10 billion and $20 billion (20%).

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Flying taxi developer Archer Aviation is seeking $1 billion in damages from Wisk Aero, a rival backed by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) co-founder Larry Page's Kitty Hawk Corp, according to a court filing, raising the stakes in a heated legal dispute.
The two have been embroiled in litigation since earlier this year when Wisk accused Archer, whose investors include United Airlines, of stealing trade secrets involving electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft.
Archer countersued and said in a filing late Tuesday that it intends to ""hold Wisk accountable for its false and malicious extra-judicial smear campaign that has caused substantial damage to Archer, likely to exceed $1 billion.""
A Wisk spokesperson said: ""Archer’s counterclaim is ludicrous and its troubles are purely self-inflicted.""
Archer plans to commercially launch its first electric flying taxi ""Maker"" in 2024, one of an increasing number of investors and aviation companies piling into the competitive but yet-to-be-approved urban air mobility space. 
""Filing a lawsuit does not give Wisk a free pass to make false and damaging statements outside of the judicial process, and yet that is exactly what Wisk has been doing,"" an Archer spokesperson said.
He said Archer would continue to seek damages even if Wisk drops its claims.
Wisk, however, plans to pursue its case, its spokesperson said.
Wisk's initial lawsuit was filed in April, two months after Archer announced plans to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Crest Investment Corp (N:ACIC), led by investment banker Ken Moelis (NYSE:MC).

Last month, Archer and sponsor Atlas slashed the pro forma enterprise value of the startup by $1 billion to $1.7 billion in a revised deal between the two companies. 
Its other investors include Stellantis and Mubadala Capital.

Investing.com – Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock plunged 14% Wednesday on a downgrade from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) after the company’s sole mothership, Eve, was grounded for enhancements for eight months starting in September.
Analyst Kristine Liwag sees the stock at $25, which is now just 6.6% away after today’s slump.
During the maintenance period, Virgin Galactic will not conduct any space flights until summer of 2022, according to StreetInsider.
While analyst Kristine Liwag views this positively as the company is investing in increasing its long-term space flight capacity, she said such investments take time.
The enhancements planned will enable Eve to fly more than once per week. Before it is grounded, Eva has a flight scheduled in September.
According to Liwag, another successful flight could be a catalyst for the stock.
In addition to one mothership, Virgin Galactic currently has one operational spaceship, Unity, which will also be soon going for enhancements. The company is also developing its Delta-class spaceship, which will have a one-week turnaround time."

Taylor Dart provides an update on the sentiment picture, and why investors should consider buying on weakness.While the month started off bad for precious metals investors, it’s gotten much worse, with many investors thrown from the frying pan into the fire. Following the opening of futures on Sunday, silver (SLV) slid by more than 8% and tested the $22.00/oz level, one of its worst one-day declines since early January. Fortunately, the metal did close well off its overnight lows but remains below its prior support level at $24.75/oz and is still down more than 4% for the week. This is a negative development and a lower low within the base-on-base pattern, and if the bulls can’t start playing defense soon, the long-term chart could flip from bullish to neutral by month-end. One of my preferred ways to play the metal is GoGold Resources (GLGDF). Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: TC2000.com)
Before this week’s sell-off, silver continued to act very well within its base-on-base pattern and was following what looked to be a similar analog to 2004-2005, with two higher lows in a base-on-base pattern, and a major breakout that followed. However, with silver breaking down below its prior low near $24.00/oz, this pattern has morphed and has increased the probability of retesting the low of this consolidation area at $21.70/oz. The silver lining is that the metal remains above its key monthly moving average (white line), keeping silver in a bull trend for the time being. Having said that, a breakdown below $22.70/oz on a monthly close would be a negative development, with a breakdown below $22.00/oz being a significant red flag. So, while the bulls are hanging in there, for the time being, further weakness without immediate buying support could become an issue.

Investing.com – Canada Goose stock (NYSE:GOOS) plunged 15% Wednesday after the winter parka retailer reiterated its 2022 outlook.
A reawakening global economy has most retailers projecting stronger performance compared to pandemic times. Canada Goose reported widening losses in the June quarter, which didn't help matters. 
The company expects its total revenue to top $1 billion in the ongoing financial year.
Revenue in the June quarter more than doubled from a year ago to C$56.3 million ($45 million). It rose by more than a third from the 2019 level.
Global e-commerce revenue increased by 123%, driven by high double-digit and low triple-digit growth rates in all major existing markets. Revenue rose significantly in all regions except Canada, which fell 7% despite elevated mandatory retail closures relative to other markets.
Direct to consumer revenue in Mainland China, which was heavily affected by Covid-19 disruptions in the comparative quarter, more than doubled.
While the operating loss was only a tad higher at C$60.7 million from last time’s C$59.3 million, finance costs rose just short of two-and-a-half times to C$16.5 million.
A higher tax rate also hurt the company’s bottom line. As a result, net loss widened to C$56.7 million from C$50.1 million.

Corrects third paragraph to say that the pilot came out of a  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) new business incubation process, not out of an innovation lab.)
By David Henry
(Reuters) -Citigroup Inc is launching a pilot service to digitally match U.S. small- and medium-sized businesses with local and regional banks willing to lend them up to $10 million.
Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it started the pilot on Wednesday with 18 banks in states in the Southeast and in Colorado.
The service was developed out of a Citigroup new business incubation process and the pilot phase will not earn any fees or interest revenue for the bank, said Rohit Mathur, a Citigroup senior vice president and a leader of the effort.
""We want to see how the borrowers and lenders interact,"" Mathur said. ""We're hoping to have good responses and we'll use the data to decide what we do next.""
Among big banks, Citigroup has relatively few U.S. branches, with 659 concentrated in six big cities. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) , JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co each have more than 4,000 branches spread throughout the country. 

Citigroup has saved money by cutting back on branch buildings and staff in favor of offering deposit and credit card accounts online. The strategy has left it with fewer places where smaller businesses might talk with lending officers who know their communities.
Citigroup said the digital service it has developed will make it easier for businesses to submit their financial information to several lenders and shop for loans, as opposed to the old method of going to local banks individually.

(Reuters) -Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd said on Wednesday its first-half loss shrank by nearly a quarter, helped by a drastic reduction in headcount and strong air cargo demand.
But Cathay, which lacks a domestic market, remains badly hit by pandemic-related border closures, with passenger revenue plunging 93% during the first six months of the year.
The lag in Hong Kong's travel recovery also means the airline is at risk of losing some prized airport slots in places like the United States and Europe under ""use it or lose it"" rules.
""This continues to be our toughest period in our history,"" Chief Financial Officer Rebecca Sharpe told analysts.
It posted a net loss of HK$7.57 billion ($973 million), in line with the company's guidance that it would be somewhat smaller than the prior year. 
That included HK$500 million of impairment charges mainly related to 11 grounded planes which are unlikely to return to service as well as HK$403 million of restructuring costs. 
In one bright spot for the airline, it said demand for air cargo, which saw yields surge 24% and accounted for 80% of all revenue, was expected to continue to be robust.
Shares in Cathay extended gains after the news to trade 3.7% higher, with Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Andrew Lee saying cargo revenue was better than expected.
The airline has forecast monthly cash burn falling in the second half and capacity rising to as much as 30% of pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter, but Sharpe said that hinges on quarantine rules for passengers and crew being relaxed.
The airline last year cut costs with the loss of 5,900 jobs and also ended its regional Cathay Dragon brand. 

Remaining pilots and cabin crew based in Hong Kong have been told they must be vaccinated by Aug. 31 or risk losing their jobs. The airline said 99% of pilots and 91% of cabin crew had booked or received vaccinations.

(Reuters) -Canada Goose Holdings Inc maintained its full-year revenue forecast after beating quarterly estimates on Wednesday, sending the luxury parka maker's shares tumbling 15% amid concerns over rising COVID-19 cases in key markets. 
The company's conservative outlook contrasted with upbeat expectations from peers Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) and Michael Kors-owner Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) Ltd in recent weeks. 
The surge in cases involving the highly infectious Delta variant of the virus has raised fears that potential new lockdowns could slam the brakes on a rebound in the global luxury goods industry.
Meanwhile, some cities in China, a key growth market for Canada Goose and other high-end apparel makers, have already put in place curbs to control an outbreak.
However, the new restrictions have not had an impact on the company's business in China yet, Canada Goose Chief Executive Officer Dani Reiss told Reuters, adding that the company was prepared for ""whatever's ahead.""
Canada Goose, best known for its pricey red parkas, reiterated its full-year revenue forecast of over C$1 billion. 
Analysts at CIBC Capital Markets said the company's forecast for low double digit wholesale revenue growth in its second quarter was below expectations.
""While the wholesale guidance is disappointing, we place greater emphasis on DTC trends given their strategic importance and materiality to results,"" analyst Mark Petrie said in a note.
The luxury outerwear maker has ramped up investments in its website and on online shopping features since the outbreak of the pandemic to mitigate the hit caused by store closures and other restrictions. 
The Toronto, Ontario-based company said first-quarter revenue more than doubled to C$56.3 million ($44.90 million), powered by a near tripling of its direct-to-consumer sales to C$29.4 million. 

Analysts on average had expected C$49.7 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Read on.Even though the rapid spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant continues to worry investors, the major stock market indexes have been hovering around their all-time highs on optimism surrounding the passage of a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill by the Senate and solid second-quarter corporate earnings. According to a FactSet report, more S&P 500 companies beat EPS estimates for the second quarter than the historic average.
However, this backdrop has led to expensive valuations for some fundamentally weak stocks. In addition, the current 38.54 Shiller PE ratio (or CAPE ratio) is significantly higher than the 16.84 mean. Several stocks that have rallied based solely on social media hype over the past few months have partly contributed to the higher-than-average Shiller P/E ratio.
Against this backdrop, we think it is wise to avoid the following three very popular stocks: Snowflake Inc. (SNOW), NIO Inc. (NIO), and Twilio Inc. (TWLO). They are rated Sell or Strong Sell in our proprietary POWR Ratings system. In addition, they have a D or F grade for Value and Quality, among other components.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 10:00AM ET</span>","Ford battery venture with SK Innovation will extend to Europe, executive says","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co's electric vehicle battery joint venture with South Korea's SK Innovation Co Ltd will extend beyond North America into Europe, a senior Ford executive said on Wednesday.
In May, Ford announced the joint venture with SK to produce about 60 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually in battery cells and array modules, starting in the middle of this decade, with the potential to expand. The deal, which still needs to be finalized, includes plans for two North American plants.
""We're very excited about this joint venture and it's going to be beyond just North America,"" Hau Thai-Tang, Ford's chief product platform and operations officer, said at a J.P. Morgan conference. ""It will certainly extend into Europe.""
Thai-Tang did not provide timing for when the joint venture would open a plant in Europe. SK Innovation declined to comment.
Ford's global EV plan calls for at least 240 GWh of battery cell capacity by 2030, equal to about 10 plants, Thai-Tang previously said. Some 140 GWh of that will be required in North America, with the balance in other regions, including Europe and China.
Also in May, Ford outlined plans to boost spending on electrification efforts by more than a third to more than $30 billion by 2030. 

On Wednesday, Thai-Tang said beyond batteries and battery pack assembly, Ford also has brought in house the production of gear boxes and motors for electrification, and was looking at software and semiconductor chips for possible vertical integration. 
A global semiconductor shortage has caused Ford and other automakers to curtail vehicle production.

Furthermore, its recent deal to sell its FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) Products business has raised investors’ concerns about the stock’s prospects. So, given the company’s business-model switch and bleak financials, can the stock rebound in the near term? Let’s discuss.FireEye, Inc. (FEYE) is a Milpitas, Calif.-based cybersecurity solutions provider. The company generated robust revenue growth last year in its Mandiant Solutions business as organizations turned to cybersecurity solutions amid rising cyber threats. But the stock’s price has dipped 16.3% over the past month and 22.5% year-to-date owing to FEYE’s unimpressive second-quarter 2021 earnings report. Also, the stock is currently trading 30% below its 52-week high of $25.53, indicating short-term bearishness.
FEYE’s recent announcement of its sale of its FireEye Products business to a private equity company has further added to investors’ anxiety surrounding the stock.
Because the company plans now to focus solely on its cloud-first security product portfolio, we think the investor uncertainty surrounding the business-model transition and its growth potential could put further downward pressure on its stock in the near term.

294,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 09:09AM ET</span>",Manic Robinhood Era Is Forcing Quants to Rethink Popular Trades,"(Bloomberg) -- Between record dip-buying and the roller coaster in  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD)., the meme-stock army is running wild across Wall Street again -- making life harder for institutional pros trading popular quant strategies.
With amateurs now commanding roughly one-fifth of U.S. equity volume, a cohort of systematic players suspect the retail billions are undermining time-tested trades like short selling and low-volatility investing.
The industry is in better shape compared to the dark days of the pandemic, and quant portfolios are more diversified than those run by human stock pickers. Yet there’s a palpable fear that the Reddit generation is getting powerful enough to disrupt the market patterns underpinning math-powered allocations.
Quants at the likes of UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) and Campbell & Company are trying to ride the retail-spurred market waves by incorporating trading activity in their models. But the day-trader penchant for chasing seemingly random companies and moving fast as a herd mean it’s not so easy to divine systematic method in the madness.
“As households start owning more and more equities, there are definitely different patterns in the marketplace,” said Mani Mahjouri, chief investment officer at quant hedge fund Blueshift Asset Management. “The retail investors coming in for whatever reason have a higher utility for risk than typical institutional investors.”
Trading activity from stocks to options surged last year as a new horde of investors flush with stimulus cash signed up for commission-free platforms like Robinhood. While their participation has dipped since the GameStop (NYSE:GME) Inc. frenzy in January, it remains above pre-pandemic levels even as the stimulus check giveaway fades and the stay-at-home era peaks.
To Mahjouri, the retail appetite for volatile names like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. is contributing to the big underperformance in a popular investing style known as low volatility, which has fallen out of favor in the risk-on reopening. A Dow Jones market-neutral index for the defensive strategy dropped for five straight quarters through June, falling 33% in its worst run of declines in more than a decade.
While quant fund performance has improved this year as a stronger risk appetite buoyed trades like value shares, the worry is whether the Reddit cohort is fueling a lasting change in market patterns.
Take short selling. Received wisdom in quantland has it that short sellers know something others don’t -- and the more willing they are to pay for their bets, the better their information probably is.
Yet a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) basket of the most-shorted U.S. shares has surged like never before to outperform the broader market by 31 percentage points this year. Retail buying of names most-shorted by hedge funds in 2021 like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. and GameStop is upending the once-popular quant trade.
It’s hard to disentangle the many forces driving pandemic trading amid record stimulus, but academic studies have chronicled the growing influence of retail investors in the broader stock market. One suggests herding by the users of trading apps leads to massive returns on the day that subsequently fizzle out. Another paper shows message-board chatter drives retail activity, fuels higher gains and deters shorting -- all in the short-term.
While quants ordinarily seek to exploit behavioral quirks and stock volatility, identifying retail flows in the first place in order to figure out price patterns is a hard task, with brokers among the few directly in the know.
Man Group’s hedge-fund advisory unit in its third-quarter outlook recommended cutting exposure to equity quants tied to a narrow set of strategies, such as those that rely on weird price moves reverting back to normal -- thanks to the random and volatile nature of retail buying and selling.
“Based on historical patterns a quantitative strategy might assume these stock price moves are a deviation from a fundamentally justifiable value,” said Man FRM’s chief investment officer Jens Foehrenbach. “But if the retail flows then keep pushing the price in the same direction, the strategy likely takes losses on this trade.”
That quants are adjusting to meme-stock traders underscores the contingent’s newfound power. Systematic investors tend to run portfolios with a huge array of securities and long-standing risk controls that should shield them from big swings in a handful of stocks. By contrast, discretionary fund managers run a greater risk of having one large exposure roiled by the r/WallStreetBets army.
Social Science
Now, both alpha-chasing quants and human stock pickers are driving a boom in alternative data sets scraping Reddit or Twitter for early signs on the next retail favorite like Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) Inc. or Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc. In a survey with 100 hedge-fund managers overseeing $231 billion conducted by SIGTech, nearly three-quarters said they’ve increased use of data from social media and chat rooms over the past year.
Campbell & Company’s Managing Director of Quant Equities Brian Meloon is among systematic players now incorporating signals on trading activity including likely retail flows to guide a stock-picking model run by the $2 billion quant hedge fund.
Similarly, UBS’s quantitative-investment strategies team recently revamped a stock-momentum product in order to incorporate flows from the bank’s retail market-making desk. The idea is, instead of just chasing the best-performing equities, the UBS offering also tracks the market-moving prowess of the day-trader cohort.
Still, it’s early days yet, with quants only just beginning to grapple with the staying power of the Robinhood crowd.
“Themes such as ‘meme’ stocks and social media have introduced more short-term volatility in certain stock clusters,” said Spyros Mesomeris, head of QIS structuring at UBS. “This reflects the increasing influence and participation of the retail sector in equity markets.”

Investing.com -- Southwest Airlines stock (NYSE:LUV) was down 2.2% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the airline warned it may not be profitable in the third quarter.
The carrier blamed the spread of the Delta variant for the rise in cancellations and bookings getting hit.
Based on the assumption that COVID-19 cases remain elevated in the near-term and current revenue trends in August continue into September, the company said its outlook for the ongoing quarter operating revenue has worsened by an estimated 3-4 points from its previous outlook three weeks ago, compared with third quarter 2019.
The company has now forecast third-quarter operating revenue to be lower by 15%-20% compared to the 2019 period.
The company reiterated that its operating revenue outlook for August is impacted by less holiday travel, an estimated 1-2 point headwind, compared with August 2019, as the Labor Day holiday weekend falls in September this time, whereas it was split between August and September in 2019.
Travel demand for the Labor Day holiday weekend remains healthy, thus far, the airline said."

Shares in the company, which increased its quarterly cash dividend by 20% to 12 cents per share, rose more than 3% in premarket trade.
Reduced restrictions on travel and restaurant capacity and reopening of offices have also boosted sales at other major U.S. restaurant chains, including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD),  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG).
Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) benefited from the breakfast menu it launched last year as well, which includes the crowd-favorite Baconator burger. The hamburger chain will boost its annual advertising spend by $10 million as it looks to draw more customers to its breakfast offering. 
Dublin, Ohio-based Wendy's also said restaurant services provider Reef Kitchens would open and run 700 delivery kitchens, over the next five years, that will offer Wendy's products across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom following a pilot in Canada.
The move comes at a time when most major U.S. fast-food restaurants have been doubling down on their digital business as people shifted to online ordering during the health crisis.
Wendy's forecast global system-wide sales growth between 11% and 13% in 2021, compared with its previous range of 8% to 10%. It also raised its earnings per share forecast to between 79 cents and 81 cents from 72 cents to 74 cents.

U.S. same-store sales for the second quarter ended July 4 rose 16.1%, above estimates of 15.3%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investing.com -- Coinbase stock (NASDAQ:COIN) was up 2.7% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as its second-quarter numbers comfortably beat estimates and the chief executive exuded confidence in the crypto exchange being the “Amazon of assets” that will list every legal crypto asset on its platform.
The exchange benefited from the surge in trading volumes on the platform as digital assets attracted more followers even as Bitcoin's contribution decreased.
Trading volumes surged more than 16 times from the year-ago quarter to $462 billion in April-June while approximately 24% of the total volume was concentrated in Bitcoin, down from 39%. This was because total Bitcoin volume fell as a percentage of global exchange spot volume and activity in other cryptos, particularly Ethereum, picked up.
The exchange plans to grow the number of assets listed on its platform, with Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong stating that he wants Coinbase to be the ""Amazon of assets"" and list every legal crypto asset on its platform, according to Reuters.
June-quarter net income at Coinbase was $1.6 billion on net revenue of $2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share on diluted basis was $3.45.
Analysts expected the company to report an EPS of $2.31 on revenue of $1.73 billion.

""In the incident, an unhealthy dynamic in a working environment, a disgusting drinking culture, a lack of transparency when reporting issues together exposed pervasive, deeply rooted unspoken rules,"" it said in a notice on its website. 
The piece calls on people to break ""unspoken rules"" such as coerced drinking.
On Sunday, a female Alibaba staffer alleged that she was sexually assaulted by her manager and a client while on a business trip.
The incident caused a storm on Chinese social media and a public backlash against Alibaba.

The staffer alleged that she was coerced into drinking while at a dinner meeting. She said that when she recounted the event to a high-level manager, he described drinking as necessary to do business.
On Monday, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang announced that the alleged perpetrator, along with several other Alibaba staff, had been fired. He also urged Alibaba employees to feel empowered to reject drinking alcohol.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Thyssenkrupp on Wednesday flagged a cash gap of up to 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) for its full year, citing restructuring costs and higher investments, as the German conglomerate continues efforts to streamline its businesses.
Shares of the steel-to-submarines group fell as much as 7.7% on the outlook for free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions, which is now expected to be a negative 1.2-1.5 billion euros in the year to September. 
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG), which reported third-quarter results that showed a marked improvement from the year-earlier period, had previously forecast the cash gap would narrow towards negative 1 billion euros from negative 5.5 billion last year.
The company is in the middle of an overhaul to simplify its structure after years of underperformance to focus on businesses such as materials, automotive, plus its hydrogen division, which CFO Klaus Keysberg said could be partly sold.
Last year, Thyssenkrupp sold its elevators division, its most profitable business, to private equity, and more recently disposed of two smaller businesses - infrastructure and mining equipment. 
The turnaround this year is incurring restructuring costs in the low to mid triple digit million euro range.
Thyssenkrupp has also raised investment in future growth at its operating divisions by 2% to 854 million after nine months, mostly due to its steel business, which could be spun off next year if the current overhaul is successful.
Keysberg said a decision on the future of the steel business, Europe's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), would not be made before spring 2022. He also said it depended on the level of external support to manage a shift towards green steel.
The division's adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) stood 19 million euros in the third quarter, compared with a 309 million loss a year earlier.
""This is a good thing, but our long-term contract structures mean there is a delay in increased raw material and steel prices feeding through to our revenues and earnings,"" Keysberg said.
Long-term steel contracts mean market developments take about half a year before showing up in Thyssenkrupp's accounts, separating it from peers such as Salzgitter, which on Wednesday posted its highest first-half pre-tax profit in 13 years.

On a group level, Thyssenkrupp's adjusted EBIT came in at 266 million euros, compared with a 693 million loss last year.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Wednesday, with investors digesting the news of the passage of a $1 billion infrastructure bill while awaiting the latest consumer inflation data.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 20 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 20 points, or 0.1%.
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained just over 160 points, or 0.5%, on Tuesday, while the broad-based S&P 500 advanced 0.1%, both closing at record highs. The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.5%, registering its second negative session in the last three. 
Investors will be holding their breath Wednesday ahead of the release of the consumer price index for July, as this could cause them to update their thinking as to when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin scaling back its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program.
The data is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and analysts are looking for a gain in the headline figure of 5.3% over last year, marginally lower than June’s 5.4%, which was the biggest monthly gain since August 2008.
Also of interest will be the news that the Senate has approved the framework for the Democrats controversial $3.5 trillion spending plan. This follows the passing of the $1 trillion infrastructure package, which is set to result in substantial investment in roads, bridges, airports and waterways.
The second-quarter corporate earnings season is drawing to a close, and it has been a generally positive one with around 90% of the S&P 500 companies that reported results beating expectations. 
Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) and Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) are set to report before the opening bell Wednesday, while Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are due after the close.
Oil prices weakened, continuing to be weighed by the Covid-induced restrictions in China, the second largest consumer in the world, even amid signs of continued healthy U.S. demand. Prices were also pressured lower following reports that the White House will call on OPEC to pump more in order to rein in rising gasoline prices.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 1.3% at $67.39 a barrel, while Brent futures dropped 1.3% at $69.75 a barrel.
Bloomberg reported Wednesday that several Asian refiners have already asked for less oil from Saudi Arabia for next month. Demand in the region, and China in particular, has been hit by the mobility restrictions put in place to combat the fast-spreading delta Covid variant.
Still, industry data from the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude oil and gasoline inventories fell last week, and investors will look to the release of the weekly official figures from the EIA later Wednesday for confirmation of this trend.

305,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",Boeing Poised to Win Crucial 737 Max Deal With New Indian Budget Carrier,"(Bloomberg) -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. is in advanced discussions with a newly created Indian budget carrier to sell 737 Max jets, according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that could give the U.S. planemaker a crucial breakthrough in a major market dominated by Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY).
The airline, Akasa, backed by billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, has also held discussions with Airbus for its best-selling A320neo jets, but that model isn’t available for delivery until several years down the track, tilting the equation in Boeing’s favor, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
The talks aren’t finalized and could still fall apart, the people said. Akasa, which is seeking initial approval from India’s aviation ministry, plans to use sale-and-leaseback deals to finance the planes, one of the people said. This would allow the new airline to receive cash from leasing firms as it takes possession of the jets.
Jhunjhunwala’s new airline is looking at operating a fleet of 70 aircraft in four years, the businessman said in a Bloomberg Television interview last month. An order for 70 units of 737 Max-8 jets -- the most popular model -- would be valued at $8.5 billion at sticker prices, although discounts are common in large plane orders. Boeing is likely to offer steeper-than-usual discounts on this deal, the people said.
A representative for Boeing said it always seeks opportunities and consistently talks with current and potential customers about how it can best support their fleet and operational needs. A representative for Jhunjhunwala didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Any transaction would give Boeing a firmer foothold in India, until recently the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, where it has outstanding Max orders from only one carrier, SpiceJet Ltd. Jet Airways India Ltd., the only other Indian customer for the 737 Max, collapsed under a pile of debt in 2019, leaving the world’s third-largest domestic market dominated by hundreds of Airbus planes.
The discussions are for a deal of as many as 80 aircraft with deliveries starting as soon as within seven months, one of the people said. Any announcement will depend on Akasa getting regulatory approvals to formally start the airline business, that person said.
The 737 Max was grounded in 2019 following two deadly crashes that killed 346 people. Its return has taken longer in Asia-Pacific than in other major jurisdictions. While the U.S., Europe and most other nations lifted the ban starting late last year following extensive fixes, China, the region’s biggest market, and India haven’t yet signed off on the plane.

SpiceJet, which saw 13 of its 737 Max jets idled, has yet to agree with Boeing on a compensation package, and the airline isn’t likely to take more deliveries before that, the people said. Delivery slots for planes originally headed to SpiceJet, Jet Airways and other customers who have deferred handovers are now available, giving Boeing a chance to offer aircraft out of schedule, they said.
A representative for SpiceJet didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. India’s Business Standard newspaper reported the talks earlier.
Both Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration have held discussions with the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the sector regulator, about the jet’s return to service, the people said. Boeing continues to work with global regulators to safely return the jet to the skies, a representative said, adding that more than 170 out of 195 global regulators have opened their airspace for the Max.
Akasa itself is an ambitious bet on one of the world’s most difficult aviation markets, where provincial taxes of up to 30% make the cost of jet fuel one of the highest in the world. Intense competition also means carriers are often forced to sell tickets below cost.
Apart from Jhunjhunwala -- locally known as India’s Warren Buffett for his successful stock picking -- Akasa is backed by Aditya Ghosh, a former head of market leader IndiGo, and Vinay Dube, a former executive at Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). and a former chief of Jet Airways, the people said.

306,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 06:01AM ET</span>",Analysis-Investors look under the radar for winners from U.S. infrastructure bill,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are ramping up the search for stocks that could benefit from a potential splurge in infrastructure spending, as a $1 trillion bipartisan bill https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whats-us-senates-bipartisan-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-2021-08-03/?enowpopup clears the Senate and heads to Congress later this year.
Money managers snapping up shares of companies expected to benefit from infrastructure spending have already helped push up the S&P 500’s materials and industrial sectors, which have both gained around 18% year-to-date, broadly in line with the benchmark index. 
Some, however, are digging deeper and delving in to areas such as certain real estate investment trusts and utilities in the search for undervalued companies that may benefit if the bill gets passed. The infrastructure package, which aims to provide the nation's biggest investment in decades in roads, bridges, airports and waterways, secured enough votes in the Senate on Tuesday and will head to Congress in the fall.
""There's going to be a lot of spending in areas that people don't necessarily associate with infrastructure,"" said Scott Helfstein, head of Thematic Investing at ProShares.
The search to unearth more beneficiaries of the infrastructure bill is among the latest examples of how investors are diversifying their portfolios as stocks continue grinding higher despite worries over stretched valuations, a resurgence of COVID-19 and a looming unwind of the Federal Reserve’s easy money policies. 
The S&P, which made a fresh record on Tuesday, has nearly doubled from its March 2020 low and is trading at 21.3 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared with its historical average of 15.4 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
Helfstein said his firm has been increasing its bets on real estate investment trusts that own ports and cell phone towers, such as Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) Corp, which he believes will benefit from the infrastructure bill. Crown Castle’s shares are up nearly 20% this year, while the S&P U.S. Real Estate REIT Index is up around 25%. He also owns shares of natural gas companies, which he expects to benefit from expanded electrification, including Williams Companies Inc (NYSE:WMB). 
John Mowrey, chief investment officer at NFJ Investment Group, has been adding to companies such as railroad operator  Norfolk Southern  Corp (NYSE:NSC), whose shares are up just 9% for the year, betting the company's revenue will increase significantly as construction materials are shipped across the country. The company’s price to earnings ratio stands near a 52-week low.
He is also buying shares of companies like utility American Water (NYSE:AWK) Works Company Inc because of its expected benefits from the infrastructure bill.
""They are getting the chance to update their systems from public spending as opposed to having to fund it all internally,"" he said. 
MORE SPENDING ON HORIZON 
The $1 trillion bill includes $550 billion in new spending on items ranging from bridges to improving broadband access. The Senate is expected to begin debate on a $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill https://www.reuters.com/world/us/paid-leave-clean-energy-preschool-democrats-35-trln-plan-2021-08-09/?enowpopup that includes additional Democratic priorities such as spending on climate resilience and electric vehicles. 
With more potential spending on the horizon, investors have been moving broadly into infrastructure plays such as the iShares U.S. Infrastructure Exchange Traded Fund, which has seen positive inflows for five of the last six weeks, including a record $51 million for the week that ended July 7, according to Lipper data. 
Still, some remain cautious over adding to new infrastructure positions across the board, given the market's stretched valuations and worries that the Fed may signal an earlier-than-expected taper of its supportive policies in coming weeks, potentially creating turbulence in asset prices.
""We're kind of in a holding period right now,"" said fund manager Barry James of James Advantage Funds.

James has still made some changes, however, adding to positions in companies like FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and e-commerce plays such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in anticipation that the infrastructure bill will improve delivery times for items that travel by highway.
""We think we have passed peak earnings for the market but this bill could give some companies another catalyst,"" he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) is planning to launch a sale of its Taiwan business, which is valued at around 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in the coming weeks, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The supermarket chain operator has hired  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to run the sale, which is expected to kick off after the summer, said the people, who declined to be identified as the information is confidential.
Carrefour has approached a number of potential buyers, including private equity firms, to gauge their interest, the people said.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
Europe's largest retailer said in June it had started considering possible consolidation, divestitures or tie-ups of its foreign subsidiaries, but denied it had decided to sell any assets.
Carrefour acquired food retailer Wellcome Taiwan from Asia's Dairy Farm in December, making it the number two player in Taiwan's convenience stores market. The transaction, with an enterprise value of 97 million euros, covers the purchase of 224 stores as well as a warehouse.

Carrefour reported 1.26 billion euros in Taiwan net sales in the first half, up 13% year on year at constant exchange rates. The company said the newly acquired Wellcome stores strongly outperformed.
While it has expanded in Taiwan in recent years, Carrefour retreated from the highly competitive Chinese market in 2019 by selling 80% of its loss-making operations https://www.reuters.com/article/carrefour-ma-suningcom-idUSL8N23U0B6 to electronics retailer Suning.com.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 04:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Great Wall Motor to shift some India investment to Brazil after approval delays -sources,"By Aditi Shah and Yilei Sun
NEW DELHI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Great Wall Motor has decided to re-allocate to Brazil a portion of its $1-billion investment in India, as the Chinese automaker has been unnerved by a year-long delay in winning government approvals, three sources told Reuters.
The re-allocation, which could range up to $300 million, comes as the sources said the maker of popular sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and pick-ups was close to acquiring a former Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) plant in Brazil to build cars.
Great Wall has also tasked James Yang, its India president since last year, with the responsibility of assisting with operations in the Latin American nation, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter.
""Brazil is almost a done deal and it did not make sense to keep the funds blocked for India,"" said one of the sources, explaining the rationale for the change of focus.
Great Wall's move is a fallout of India's decision in April 2020 to more closely scrutinise investments from China, the sources said, as part of a crackdown that followed a border clash between the two Asian giants. 
Just two months before, amid the fanfare of India's biennial car show, Great Wall had said it would invest $1 billion to build cars there, by buying a former General Motors (NYSE:GM) factory, as well as making batteries and car parts. 
Two of the sources said the re-allocated funds, budgeted by Great Wall for India since 2020, would mainly have been used to buy GM's factory, a cost that sources had earlier put at about $300 million.
Great Wall declined to comment. The Indian government did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.
The step highlights growing nervousness and impatience among Chinese investors, who have seen roughly 150 investment proposals worth more than $2 billion held up by India's slow approvals process, according to industry estimates.
The delays are forcing Great Wall, which was expected to begin selling its India-made Haval brand of SUVs in the country this year, to look at taking a more measured approach. 
It may even consider entering the market with a fully-built imported vehicle before starting domestic production, one of the sources said.
""When approvals in India come through, Great Wall will be ready with the money, but it may not be a straight decision anymore,"" said the source.
""The company will judge the situation before moving forward. What if future approvals get stuck?""
Earlier this year, India had been set to clear about 45 of the investment proposals from China, mainly in manufacturing, but it was not immediately clear how many had been approved. 
Indian officials say the situation cannot return to business as usual until de-escalation at the border is complete, however.
The Chinese automaker will also wait for ties between the two nations to improve and for the COVID-19 pandemic to ease in India before speeding up its plans for the market, said a second source.
Great Wall still wants to make cars in India and is now building its supply chain, the source added.
The firm saw India as a key market when it kicked off its global expansion, envisioning its plant in the subcontinent to be its biggest outside China.
Great Wall now makes cars in Russia and Thailand, where it acquired a plant at the time it announced its India plans. 
Brazil is the latest market in its global push, where it plans to build its Haval brand of SUVs for domestic sale and export, the sources said.

Great Wall, which sold 1.1 million cars last year, mostly in China, is eyeing an aggressive plan to expand in Asian, European and Latin American markets.
It is developing electric Mini cars with BMW and is building a factory with the German premium carmaker in China.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's Lenovo Group (OTC:LNVGY) Ltd said it expects strong demand for personal computers to continue until at least 2025 as the pandemic permanently changes how people live and work, after it reported a more than doubling in first-quarter profit. 
The world's biggest maker of personal computers (PC) said it was not seeing a slowdown in pandemic-driven demand, as some analysts have predicted, because many people continue to work from home while companies are purchasing more PCs as they re-open offices. 
""The hybrid working model will become the new normal, the PC has come back to the centre of people's work and lives,"" Lenovo's Chairman and CEO Yuanqing Yang told Reuters in an interview. 
Shares in the company rose by as much as 9.7% after the company posted an almost 120% jump in first-quarter profit to $466 million, and were on course for their biggest daily percentage gain since March 30..
Analysts had expected a profit of $345.23 million, according to Refinitiv's average of six forecasts.
Revenue rose 27% to $16.9 billion from $13.3 billion a year earlier, also topping analyst expectations of $16 billion. Net income margin was 2.8%, which the company said was the highest in many years
The results were the first earnings released by the company since it reorganised its business groups in February. 
Yang said that they expected the global chip shortage to last until the first half of next year and that the company still had a very large backlog of orders to fulfil. However, he said Lenovo was helped by its unique hybrid supply chain model which sourced components externally and from in-house manufacturing.
He said the company wants to achieve ""hyper growth"" in its mobile business, which includes the Motorola (NYSE:MSI) smartphone range, leveraging a changing competitive landscape that has seen former leader Huawei Technologies retreat from the market. 
""Definitely, from now on, we will drive the profitable growth for this business,"" he said. ""We want to be a solid no.3 in North America, we will grow faster in Europe and some Asia Pacific countries.""

Worldwide shipments of personal computers rose 13% year-on-year to hit 82.3 million units in the second quarter of 2021, with desktop shipments growing for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019, research firm Canalys said in a report https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/Canalys-global-PC-market-Q2-2021 last month. 
Lenovo extended its industry lead, shipping more than 20 million units for the third consecutive quarter to take 24.4% market share, compared with HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) with 22.6% and Dell with 17%, Canalys said.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 03:40AM ET</span>",Australia's CBA returns record $7 billion in buyback and dividend as profit rebounds,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), the country's largest lender, said on Wednesday it will return a record $7 billion to investors in buybacks and dividends as an economic rebound from the pandemic pushed its annual cash profit up almost a fifth.
Australia's early control of the pandemic in 2020 and the resulting swift economic rebound https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2ES0CD have driven property prices and credit growth higher, boosting banks coffers to record levels.
Coronavirus outbreaks, stoked by the highly contagious Delta variant, and ongoing lockdowns in major cities https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-victoria-reports-slight-rise-local-covid-19-cases-2021-08-09 is clouding the outlook, however, and aggressive competitors such as buy now, pay later players are threatening https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/29-billion-deal-11-weeks-how-square-bought-afterpay-2021-08-03 banks' market dominance.
""The pandemic continues to have an impact on the Australian economy, as well as the health of our communities,"" Chief Executive Matt Comyn said.
""(But) we are still optimistic about the Australian economic recovery and prospects... we do believe that there will be strong economic growth in calendar 2022."" 
With A$11.5 billion in excess capital, mostly built through divestments such as its asset management and general insurance units, CBA feels it has plenty of capacity to return a portion of that through a record A$6 billion share buyback and still be able to absorb potential stress.
CBA, which doubled its dividend to A$2.00 per share from 98 Australian cents last year, is the latest of the country's cash-jammed Big Four banks to approve multi-billion capital returns to shareholders, and analysts expect more https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-banks-led-by-cba-set-return-record-15-bln-cash-investors-2021-06-01 in the next two years.
With 1.7 million shares on issue, the dividend payment would add up to about A$3.5 billion, and including its interim payment of A$1.5 per share, the bank's payout ratio sits at 71% of its yearly cash earnings, it said.
""While we do see the bank has a very strong cash flow generating business, and they do give out a lot of that cash flow as dividends, the question is then, are they going to be able to grow that dividend? Grow those earnings?"" said Max Cappetta, chief portfolio manager at Redpoint Investment Management, a CBA investor.
CBA's buyback offer will be at a discount in the range of 10%-14% to the market price, and will reduce the share count by more than 3.5%. This will result in higher key profitability metrics such as return on equity, earnings per share and dividend per share. 
CBA shares rose 2.3% to a record high of A$109.03 in early trading before settling down to close 1.51% higher.
MORE HEADWINDS THAN TAILWINDS 
Comyn acknowledged the strength of Australia's economic recovery over fiscal 2021, but said the continuing pandemic and lower interest rates would pressure the bank's future earnings.
""We're constantly evaluating the revenue situation. I mean the volume growth has been very strong this year, but in the near term yes, net interest margins will continue to be under pressure and we're going to try and manage that as best we can.""
The lender, which follows a different reporting calendar than its rivals, said cash net profit after tax rose 19.8% to A$8.65 billion in the year ended June 30, beating an average estimate of A$8.55 billion from five analysts.
That was mainly due to lower loan impairment charges, which fell to A$554 million from A$2.52 billion last year.
Expenses, however, rose 3.3% to A$11.36 billion, higher than most analysts expected, driven by remediation charges and higher wages - the bank is recruiting 600 engineers in Australia and has opened an office in India. 
Meanwhile operating income rose only 1.7% to A$24.1 billion, as it warned there would be ""more headwinds that tailwinds"" ahead. 
""Investors will receive the capital return announcement well, but will be starting to ask at what point is it priced in,""  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) banking analyst Brendan Sproules said.

""Despite an overall in-line result, the revenue outlook appears more challenged than our expectations.""

313,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 03:40AM ET</span>",Marketmind - The price of U.S. recovery,"A look at the day ahead from Dhara Ranasinghe. 
One way or another, Wednesday's U.S. July inflation print could prove key for markets torn between strong data that suggests the time for withdrawing stimulus is nearing and concern that a resurgent delta COVID variant could stall growth.
For two months, markets have largely ignored strong inflation prints, buying into the Fed's mantra that a pick-up in price pressures is temporary. So what's different this time?
Well for starters, Friday's stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data has reignited talk that an improving jobs market will encourage the Fed to start tapering soon. Note, the Fed's Raphael Bostic said this week he would only need to see one or two more job reports like July to vote for tapering.
And Tuesday's passing of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate is a reminder that upward pressure on prices could be sustained for longer than anticipated.
Having pushed Treasury yields down (and prices up) for four straight months, bond investors are clearly uneasy: 10-year bond yields are up 20 basis points from last week's six-month lows.
Economists polled by Reuters estimate U.S. inflation rose 5.3% in the 12 months through July, versus 5.4% in June.
Given that talk of a Fed taper is usually followed by the word 'tantrum', it remains to be seen if today's number brings relief or panic. 
As markets await the release, the dollar is on firm ground, world stocks are trading sideways, European and U.S. stock futures are flat.
In corporate news, high materials prices and demand from the car sector helped Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) swing to an quarterly operating profit. And Dutch bank ABN Amro is to resume dividend payments thanks to a strong bounce in net profit.

315,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 02:36AM ET</span>",Analysis-Shoots of greenflation spring new challenges on portfolio managers,"By Sujata Rao and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - From container ships to cardboard, tighter environmental regulations are stoking shortages and price spikes as 'greenflation' takes a grip, adding a new twist to corporate valuations.
For all the inflation-is-transitory messages from central banks, double or triple-digit cost increases have become common on company balance sheets, although the green variety has yet to show up in bond markets, the usual early warning system.
While higher costs are partly down to pandemic-linked supply glitches, fund managers say a powerful impetus is emanating from stringent new rules to guide the world's transition to a greener future.
And these may outlast the COVID-19 inflation narrative. 
To slash greenhouse gas emissions, the European Union will lift the cost of emitting carbon for transport and factories, ditch sales of gasoline-fuelled cars and slap carbon levies on trade partners.
Aluminium, electricity and fertiliser are among sectors targeted, with others such as aviation in the EU crosshairs.
Investors largely agree greenflation is a necessary risk, because with the United Nations saying global warming is spiralling out of the control, the alternative of frequent floods, droughts and forest fires is worse.
The question facing fund managers is which companies will see a profit hit, which can pass costs on and which will thrive.
For Peter Rutter, head of equities at Royal London Asset Management, the solution lies in modelling how, for instance, carbon dynamics may impact cash flow, revenues and share prices.
""We are big believers in greenflation. There are scenarios that take assets out of use, like cars that can no longer be driven or ships that are not allowed into certain ports.""
""The other element is the injection of additional costs. If companies can pass on the costs, it's inflationary. If not, it adds inflation to production and hurts margins,"" Rutter added.
Company earnings are reflecting higher input costs. But it is hard to say which are environment-related. 
U.S. retailer  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) saw a 35 basis-point hit to gross margins in the first quarter from a tripling of lumber prices, offsettting a 31% rise in same-store sales.
And packaged foods company Conagra warned raw material and packaging costs were hurting profit, a headwind that would not ease until late-2022.
BofA analysts tallied references to ""inflation"" during the latest-quarter earnings calls and estimate they rose 1000% year-on-year for companies in the S&P 500 and 400% for those in Europe's STOXX 600 indexes. 
Graphic: Inflation mentions https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byprjowgbpe/bofa.PNG 
GROWING A TREE
In shipbuilding, for instance, orders have plunged, which officials attribute partly to uncertainty over which technology to adopt for alternative fuels..
New vessels take up to three years to deliver and typically operate for more than 20 years, by which time high-emission ships may be unviable. And if shipping is added to carbon markets, owners must buy permits or risk port bans. 
Graphic: Ratio of dry bulk ship orders to fleet size has shrunk https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/INFLATION/jnpwegdmjpw/chart.png 
That may support already elevated freight costs . 
Similarly, tighter forestry regulations and the closure of polluting Chinese foundries are impacting timber and metal prices, PIMCO fund manager Geraldine Sundstrom noted. 
""It takes time to grow a tree,"" Sundstrom said. ""In a green and digital world, you need to position in the right place, where there are barriers to entry and therefore pricing power.""
Sundstrom reckons sectors such as integrated forestries and shipping could enjoy significant price gains ""as markets are still betting on prices mean-reverting.""
There will be losers too. World stocks could suffer a 20% setback if carbon prices -- the price companies pay to pollute -- rise by $75 per tonne, recent research by Kempen Capital Management, which manages 86 billion euros, estimates.
Within sectors, carbon-intense firms will lose out as border taxes on carbon kick in, BofA says.
Hydropower-reliant aluminium producers Norsk Hydro (OTC:NHYDY), Rusal and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) with a carbon footprint of four tonnes of carbon dioxide per tonne of metal, are better placed than Chinese smelters with 16 tonnes of emissions, it added.
TURNOVER
So does this mean higher inflation for the broader economy?
Greenflation will not last forever as carbon pricing effects will be spread over years, while the adoption of renewables should gradually cut power generation costs.
Yet that ""deflationary turnover"" will take time,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said.
Prices for carbon emission allowances have more than doubled this year, which Morgan Stanley estimated had raised euro zone retail electricity prices by 8% by June and added 23 basis points to inflation. A rise to 100 euros will boost retail power prices 12%, it says.
And clean energy faces costs of its own, with electrical equipment, wind turbines and fuel cells exposed to higher metals and shipping prices.
Michael Herzum, head of strategy at Germany's Union Investment, said price jumps are inevitable as carbon will be priced at a high enough level to incentivise change.

While the effect should wane over time, Herzum said that the green transformation will reinforce a ""40 year period of disinflation has come to an end"".

Amsterdam-based ABN said net profit rose to 393 million euros ($460.48 million ) in the second quarter, as coronavirus restrictions were eased and companies gradually resumed business.
Analysts in a company-compiled poll had predicted an average net profit of 266 million euros for the April-June period.
""Demand for corporate loans in the Netherlands is still muted as strong government support continues, but it is showing signs of stabilising and the pipeline is improving"", Chief Executive Robert Swaak said.
Largely state-owned ABN released 79 million euros of impairments made during the coronavirus crisis, which partly offset a steep decline in net interest income as low rates continued to hurt its profit margins.
Net interest income fell 14% to 1.3 billion euros, missing analysts' expectations after a 11% decline in the first three months of 2021.

ABN said its capital position remained strong, allowing it to pay out suspended dividends over 2019 in October, and to remain committed to paying out 50% of its net profits to shareholders in the time to come.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 01:40AM ET</span>",Debt-laden Evergrande says in sale talks for certain assets; shares jump,"HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares of debt-laden China Evergrande Group jumped on Wednesday after it confirmed that it is in talks to sell certain assets, as the move could ease cashflow pressure amid market speculation over a potential restructuring. 
Shares of Evergrande, the country's most indebted property developer, jumped as much as 12% in morning trading, after the firm said in a filing on Tuesday the proposed sales included stakes in Hong Kong-listed units Evergrande New Energy Vehicle and Evergrande Property Services. 
Shares of EV unit rose 9%, while the property management unit surged 16.4%.
Reuters reported on Monday about the sale talks, which also include the bulk of Evergrande's urban renewal projects in top-tier southern city Shenzhen.
The developer has been struggling to raise funds amid concerns over its financial health and the potential systemic financial risks it poses. 
Rating agency S&P downgraded Evergrande to CCC from B- on Aug. 5, having already downgraded it by another two notches within the preceding fortnight. S&P estimated Evergrande has over 240 billion yuan ($37.14 billion) of bills and trade payables from contractors to settle over the next 12 months, of which around 100 billion yuan is due within 2021.
Raymond Cheng, a managing director of CGS-CIMB Securities, estimated Evergrande could raise about $3.2 billion from the stake sales in the two units, which would then improve the company's net gearing by 10%, down to 90%. 
""The latest development is positive for Evergrande and also illustrates its determination to deleverage further,"" he said. 
Recently, Evergrande had sold shares in internet unit HengTen Networks and smaller peer China Calxon Group to raise cash.
The firm has also financed through share pledges. According to corporate search engine Tianyancha, Evergrande had pledged its shares in Xinjiang Guanghui Industry Investment and Evergrande Life Insurance to Shengjing Bank in the end of July. 
There is increasing speculation that Evergrande may head to a restructuring, after China decided last week that lawsuits against Evergrande across the country will be centrally handled by the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court. 
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said previous cases including Tsinghua Unigroup and HNA Group where litigations were centralized have became distressed before entering into restructuring.
Early this week, Evergrande's onshore bond custodians Guotai Junan and CSC Financial said in separate filings that they limited bond trades to only institutional investors from Monday. 

""We view as a step to limit individual investor participation and prepare for potential restructuring in the future,"" Nomura said in a trading note.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 01:17AM ET</span>",How Sweden became the Silicon Valley of Europe,"By Colm Fulton and Supantha Mukherjee
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - As Klarna's billionaire founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski prepares to stage one of the biggest-ever European fintech company listings, a feast of capitalism, he credits an unlikely backer for his runaway success: the Swedish welfare state.
In particular, the 39-year-old pinpoints a late-1990s government policy to put a computer in every home.
""Computers were inaccessible for low-income families such as mine, but when the reform came into play, my mother bought us a computer the very next day,"" he told Reuters.
Siemiatkowski began coding on that computer when he was 16. Fast-forward more than two decades, and his payments firm Klarna is valued at $46 billion and plans to go public. It hasn't given details, though many bankers predict it will list in New York early next year. 
Sweden's home computer drive, and concurrent early investment in internet connectivity, help explain why its capital Stockholm has become such rich soil for startups, birthing and incubating the likes of Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Skype and Klarna, even though it has some of the highest tax rates in the world.
That's the view of Siemiatkowski and several tech CEOs and venture capitalists interviewed by Reuters.
In the three years the scheme ran, 1998-2001, 850,000 home computers were purchased through it, reaching almost a quarter of the country's then-four million households, who didn't have to pay for the machines and thus included many people who were otherwise unable to afford them.
In 2005, when Klarna was founded, there were 28 broadband subscriptions per 100 people in Sweden, compared with 17 in the United States - where dial-up was still far more common - and a global average of 3.7, according to data from the World Bank.
Spotify allowed users to stream music when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iTunes was still download-based, which gave the Swedish company the upper-hand when streaming became the norm around the world.
""That could only happen in a country where broadband was the standard much earlier, while in other markets the connection was too slow,"" Siemiatkowski said.
""That allowed our society to be a couple of years ahead.""
Some executives and campaigners say the Scandinavian nation demonstrates that a deep social safety net, often viewed as counter to entrepreneurial spirit, can foster innovation. It's an outcome that might not have been envisaged by the architects of Sweden's welfare state in the 1950s.
Childcare is, for the most part, free. A range of income insurance funds can protect you if your business fails or you lose your job, guaranteeing up to 80% of your previous salary for the first 300 days of unemployment.
""The social safety net we have in Sweden allows us to be less vulnerable to taking risks,"" said Gohar Avagyan, the 31-year-old co-founder of Vaam, a video messaging service used for sales pitches and customer communication.
STARTUP RATE VS SILICON VALLEY
Although overall investments are larger in the bigger European economies of Britain and France and their longstanding finance hubs, Sweden punches above its weight in some regards.
It has the third highest startup rate in the world, behind Turkey and Spain, with 20 startups per 1000 employees and the highest three year survival rate for startups anywhere, at 74%, according to a 2018 study by OECD economists. 
Stockholm is second only to Silicon Valley in terms of unicorns - startups valued at above $1 billion - per capita, at around 0.8 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to Sarah Guemouri at venture capital firm Atomico.
Silicon Valley - San Francisco and the Bay Area - boasts 1.4 unicorns per 100,000, said Guemouri, co-author of a 2020 report on European tech companies. 
No one can say for sure if the boom will last, though, in a country where capital gains are taxed at 30 percent and income tax can be as high as 60 percent. 
In 2016, Spotify said it was considering moving its headquarters out of the country, arguing high taxes made it difficult to attract overseas talent, though it hasn't done so. 
Yusuf Ozdalga, partner at venture capital firm QED Investors, said access to funding and administrative or legal tasks connected with founding a company could also prove tough to navigate for non-Swedish speakers. 
He contrasted that to Amsterdam, capital of the Netherlands, where the government adopted English as an official language in April to make life easier for international companies.
'INTERESTING DILEMMA' FOR VC
Jeppe Zink, partner at London-based venture capital firm Northzone, said a third of all the exit value from fintech companies in Europe - the amount received by investors when they cash out - came from Sweden alone.
Government policy had contributed to this trend, he added. 
""Its an interesting dilemma for us venture capitalists as we're not used to regulation creating markets, in fact we are inherently nervous about regulation.""
Sweden's digital minister Anders Ygeman said that social regulation could make it ""possible to fail"" and then ""be up and running again"" for innovators.

Peter Carlsson, CEO of startup Northvolt, which makes Lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and is valued at $11.75 billion, said that ultimately success bred success.
""You're really creating ripple effects when you're seeing the success of somebody else and I think that's perhaps the most important thing in order to create local ecosystems.""

Investing.com – China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) shares jumped after the company said it is in discussions to sell stakes in two of its units, that could potentially inject fresh funds.
A statement released after hours on Tuesday said that the talks are with “several independent third-party investors” who are looking to purchase stakes in the property firm’s electric vehicle start-up and property services units.
China Evergrande stocks jumped 8.52% to HK$6.37 ($1.09) by 1:03 AM ET (5:03 AM GMT), after jumping as much as 12% earlier in the session.
The sale could help the company avert a liquidity crisis, as it currently has more than $300 billion in liabilities.
Assuming Evergrande maintains control of the auto and property services units, the firm may raise about HK$25 billion ($3.21 billion) from selling the minority stakes, CGS-CIMB Securities property analyst Raymond Cheng told Bloomberg.
“It’s positive for Evergrande... we prudently believe that Evergrande bankruptcy risk may not be as high as bond prices suggested,” Cheng added.
Other investors were also positive about the sale’s prospects.
“The potential asset sales could be wide-ranging,” Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst Daniel Fan said in a note. The company’s unlisted units, such as online sales platform Fangchebao, could also be sold, although likely at a deeper discount, the note added.
Also among other potential future funding sources are placements for Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd. and China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd., and initial public offerings for operations including its beverage business, FCB, and amusement park and tourism properties, according to Fitch Ratings."

Mao Taotao, director of public relations at Weibo, is suspected of bribery and had ""seriously harmed the interests of the company"", according to an internal memo sent to staff and republished in local media.
A company source confirmed the accuracy of the memo.
""In accordance with company policy and the law, we have decided to fire Mao as punishment, and will not re-hire him,"" the memo said.

The memo said Mao had been arrested by authorities. Mao joined Weibo in 2010 and quickly rose through the ranks of the marketing and PR department, the memo states. ""As a longtime employee of the company and head of an important department. He failed to act as role model and fell to temptation, which fills us with pain and regret,"" the memo added. Weibo did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Mao could not be immediately reached. Chinese tech companies have doubled down on corruption investigations in recent years, amid an anti-graft campaign by President Xi Jinping and as their valuations and profiles have soared following a tech boom. Earlier this year, a former vice-president of Kuaishou was arrested for alleged corruption, while Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) said one of its company executives was being investigated by authorities over allegations of ""personal corruption.

321,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2021 12:11AM ET</span>",Chinese tech firms 'self-correct' to get ahead of potential regulatory fury,"By Yingzhi Yang and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - Fretting about unprecedented regulatory heat for China's tech sector, some companies are no longer waiting for any official reprimands that may or may not be forthcoming.
Instead, eager to pre-empt authorities, they've decided to 'self-correct', imposing restrictions on or even walking away from their own businesses.
KE Holdings, China's largest platform matching buyers and sellers of real estate, is one such example.
This year it quietly shut down its VIP services that promised fast-turnarounds for property sellers in exchange for exclusive listings and which had featured prominently on its popular Lianjia and Beike apps, two people familiar with the matter said. 
The decision to pull the plug on the VIP services was not prompted by a regulatory request but KE, which is currently the subject of an antitrust probe https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-launches-antitrust-probe-into-tencent-backed-property-broker-ke-2021-05-25, had wanted to move ""proactively"" and ""voluntarily"", said the people who declined to be identified as KE has not publicised its actions.
""It wasn't a big business but it had the potential to become one,"" said one of the sources. 
KE said in a statement to Reuters that any business adjustments on its part ""were in compliance with government regulations and aimed at providing better services.""
So-called 'self-correction' is promising to become a major corporate trend as the government tears into regulatory norms to promote socialist values and rein in what critics have called reckless capitalist expansion. The term is increasingly used by state media and is similar in tone to 'self-criticism' - a practice encouraged by China's Communist Party.
THE NEW NORMAL
One of the most high-profile examples has been Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd's decision this month to introduce new limits https://www.reuters.com/technology/tencent-falls-after-china-media-calls-online-gaming-spiritual-opium-2021-08-03 on kids' time spent on ""Honor of Kings"", its most popular video game. That came just hours after its shares were battered by a state media article which described online games as ""spiritual opium"".
""Everyone is trying to get a clear read on the new normal and is resetting as fast as possible,"" said Jeffery Towson, host of the Asia Tech Strategy podcast and former professor of investment at Peking University. ""Nobody is doing 'move fast and break things' anymore. Nobody is using their market power too aggressively. Everyone is aligning their strategies more closely with the government's priorities,"" he said. 
While Chinese regulators have clamped down on a range of sectors from property to cryptocurrencies to private tutoring, the tech sector has come in for some of the harshest measures to date.
Ant Group's mega listing was scuppered at the eleventh hour last year, while regulators in July ordered newly listed ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc to take down its app from app stores in China. 
A slew of antitrust probes have also been launched, fines imposed, including a record $2.75 billion antitrust penalty for  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, while new guidance and regulations have been introduced or are in the works.
Other 'self-correcting' companies include NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Music which announced last month it would not enter into exclusive contracts, a move that came after Tencent was barred by China's market regulator from entering into exclusive music copyright agreements.
Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) also pulled an online list that ranks celebrities by popularity after a state media report critical of celebrity culture. 

""The brutal growth, disorder and greed of Chinese tech companies have caused a series of problems,"" said Xie Pu, founder of Chinese tech website Techie Crab.
""This kind of 'self-correction' will bring a relatively healthy competitive environment.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India, the United States and parts of other emerging markets have seen fund inflows redirected from China as recent regulatory crackdowns in the world's second-biggest economy have spooked markets, according to veteran investor Mark Mobius.
""I would say half the money has just left ... But I think that is temporary, it will not last,"" Mobius, emerging markets fund manager and founder of Mobius Capital Partners, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum (GMF) on Tuesday.
Mobius said his firm was ""heavily concentrated in India"", with about a 20% allocation, adding that he was bullish on sectors ranging from medical testing to industrial equipment.
""It's a pretty wide scope that we have in India. Lots of opportunities.""
Mobius earlier made his name as an emerging markets guru with U.S. money manager Franklin Templeton, where he managed over $50 billion in EM portfolios. 
The effects of China's crackdown will be temporary, and over the long-term, curb monopolistic trends enabling small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) to thrive, said Mobius, whose firm manages over $414 million in assets.
The unpredictability of China's regulatory measures https://reut.rs/3xrDq79 make the country unappealing to foreign investors in the short term but could make it attractive in the long run, global fund managers told GMF last week.
In China, Mobius was upbeat on medical equipment makers, healthcare, higher-level education companies that haven't been impacted by the recent crackdowns, consumer products and fast food.
""We feel that it's good where we are,"" he said, adding that he would consider buying some stocks, especially in the SME segment, given the recent price corrections.
""There are opportunities now in China as a result of this panic following the government intervention,"" Mobius said. 
Along with India, Mobius said his fund was bullish on Taiwan and Brazil.

BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) -A Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX test plane took to the skies in China on Wednesday as the U.S. manufacturer looks to end a nearly two-and-a-half-year regulatory grounding of the model in the key travel market.
Flight-tracking website Flightradar24 showed a 737 MAX 7 test plane taking off from Shanghai's Pudong International Airport at 9:24 a.m. (0124 GMT), with no destination listed, flying in a south-easterly direction.
The flight tracking was incomplete, but photos on Chinese aviation blogs showed it landed at Zhoushan Putuoshan Airport, about 150 km (80 nautical miles) to the south, which industry sources told Reuters was the expected destination.
Boeing has a 737 MAX completion plant in Zhoushan to install interiors and paint airplane liveries.
The 737 MAX test plane had left Seattle last week and arrived in Shanghai on Aug. 7 after refuelling stops in Honolulu and Guam. Reuters reported last week it was due for its first test flight in China on Aug. 11 if all went well.
Boeing said it was continuing to work with global regulators as they complete their validation processes on the model and declined to comment specifically on the test flight in China.
After flight testing, China's regulator is expected to issue an aircraft evaluation report and put it out for comment before pilot training could begin, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
About 30 airlines and 175 countries have allowed the 737 MAX to return to service following a nearly two-year safety ban after crashes five months apart killed 346 people, plunging Boeing into a financial crisis since compounded by the coronavirus pandemic.
Boeing's 737 MAX remains grounded in China, where trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have cut off sales for years, although Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said last month he still expected the 737 MAX to win approval before year-end. 

China's aviation regulator previously issued three requirements for the 737 MAX's return to service: certified design changes, sufficient pilot training, and definitive findings from the crash investigations.
Before the 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019, Boeing was selling one quarter of the planes it built annually to Chinese buyers. For years, simmering tensions between Washington and Beijing have caused uncertainty.

U.S. District Judge Alan Albright in Waco, Texas, denied Intel's motion for a new trial in a sealed order issued late Monday.
Jurors on March 2 had awarded VLSI $1.5 billion and $675 million for Intel's respective infringement of two patents that were once owned by Dutch chipmaker  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI).

In seeking a new trial, Intel said the verdict was tainted by erroneous jury instructions and evidentiary rulings, and appeared to be based on earlier Intel settlements that VLSI's own damages expert admitted were not comparable.

Santa Clara, California-based Intel noted that the verdict was the second largest by a jury in a patent case, and that the three other largest verdicts had been vacated.

By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global payments giant JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) has launched a real-time payments option that it hopes will increase its edge in the financial industry's battle to handle more of the surging volumes of global digital payments.
The new product, called request for pay, lets corporate clients send payment requests to the bank's roughly 57 million retail clients who use its app or website, cutting the cost and time it takes for those companies to get paid, said Cyrus Bhathawalla, the bank's global head of real-time payments.
The digital payments product is one of a handful JPMorgan has in the works, as the largest U.S. bank invests heavily in the sector which has grown sharply as more commerce occurs online, a trend further boosted during the coronavirus lockdowns.
""Our job is to give multiple different payment types so corporates and merchants can provide the right options to their customers,"" Bhathawalla said. 
The service went live last month and began a pilot phase with its first corporate client, a fintech company, last week. Executives declined to name the company. 
JPMorgan envisions clients like a gas distributing company using the service to get paid faster for filling up a gas station's supply tanks, Bhathawalla said.

Currently, that kind of company may have to wait a week to get paid. A digital payment could happen in less than 30 seconds, he said.
One of the first banks to participate in The Clearing House real-time payments network in 2017, JPMorgan processes about 12 million transactions a month. The business is part of the wholesale payments division, which contributes roughly 10% of JPMorgan's revenue.

Renowned auto manufacturers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) (VWAGY) and General Motors (GM) are examples. They are both well-positioned to benefit from the industry’s long-term growth prospects. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now. Read on.Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) are two well-established players in the auto manufacturers industry. VWAGY is a Germany-based automobile company that offers passenger cars, commercial vehicles, power engineering, and financial services. GM in Detroit, Mich., designs, manufactures, and sells cars, trucks, crossover vehicles, and related automobile parts worldwide. It also offers vehicle protection, maintenance, satellite radio, and automotive financing services.
While auto production is still suffering from the global semiconductor chip shortage, many auto manufacturers are striving to meet the demand for efficient and advanced products amid the economic recovery and rising discretionary spending. Furthermore, government and private initiatives to address the global chip shortage bode well for the auto industry. Indeed, the U.S. car and automobile manufacturing market is expected to increase 12.3% to $82.60 billion in 2021. Consequently, both VWAGY and GM should see increasing demand for their products.
But while GM's stock has declined 8.2% over the past month, VWAGY's has gained 4.2%. VWAGY is a clear winner with 58% gains versus GM’s negative returns in terms of their past six month’s performance. But, which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

Many companies reported rising sales and record profit margins despite increasing costs. So, we think shares of Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), and Innospec (NASDAQ:IOSP), which surpassed consensus EPS estimates in the last reported quarter, could be worth watching. Let's discuss.The second quarter of 2021 witnessed a significant jump in corporate earnings, offsetting concerns related to production and supply bottlenecks and decelerating economic growth. According to a survey conducted by the National Association of Business Economics (NABE), 66% of companies reported an increase in sales in the second quarter. In comparison, a mere 3% of companies reported lower sales on a sequential basis.
Furthermore, companies have been reporting record profit margins in the second quarter despite the impact of inflation. S&P 500 companies’ overall earnings for the second quarter are expected to grow 76% year-over-year, representing their best growth since 2009.
Corporate earnings reports for the second quarter have been great so far and are expected to remain favorable for investors. So, we think Illumina, Inc (ILMN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp has begun marketing U.S. shale gas properties as it ramps up a long-stalled program that aims to raise billions of dollars to shed unwanted assets and reduce debt taken on last year.
Three years ago, the top U.S. oil producer set a goal of raising $15 billion from sales by December 2021. More recently, it promised to accelerate lagging sales to whittle a record $70 billion debt pile. 
The company's XTO Energy shale unit is seeking buyers for almost 5,000 natural gas wells in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas, spokeswoman Julie King confirmed. 
The assets are among gas projects with declining production and market value Exxon (NYSE:XOM) is selling as it focus on newer ventures in Guyana, offshore Brazil and Texas's Permian Basin.
Exxon is marketing the properties itself and aims to receive bids by Sept. 16 and close any sale by year-end. 
""We are providing information to third parties that may have an interest in the assets,"" King said. No buyers have been identified, she said, declining to confirm the due date for bids or the company's anticipated value on the wells. 
DECLINING PRODUCTION
The company has achieved about a third of its three-year, $15 billion sales target. This year, it has received sales proceeds of $557 million through June, and has deals pending valued at more than $2.15 billion.
Exxon acquired the Fayetteville assets https://www.reuters.com/article/us-petrohawk/petrohawk-sells-some-assets-to-exxon-for-650-million-idUKTRE6BM3AU20101223 in 2010 for $650 million during a shale boom that would change the U.S. energy landscape, leading to an oversupply of gas that pushed prices to record lows and last year. This led Exxon to reduce the value of its U.S. oil and gas holdings by $17.1 billion.
Output in the assets on offer fell by more than half since 2016 to about 160 million cubic feet per day last year, according to Exxon marketing materials seen by Reuters. 
The Arkansas properties cover some 416,000 net acres (1,680 square kilometers) and are some of the North American natural gas resources cut last year from Exxon's development plan. The sale includes 844 operated and 4,104 non-operated wells, King said. 
Dallas-based Merit Energy is evaluating the properties, one person familiar with the matter said. Merit in 2018 purchased about 258,000 acres in the same area from BHP for $300 million.
Merit did not reply to requests for comment by phone, e-mail and LinkedIn. Exxon declined to comment on potential bidders.
WORLDWIDE DIVESTMENTS 
Exxon, which suffered a historic $22.4 billion loss in 2020, is selling dozens of properties in Asia, Africa, the United States and Europe.  
The company is prioritizing debt reduction and its shareholder dividend, officials said last month. After total debt last year doubled to almost $70 billion since 2018, Exxon paid off more than $7 billion this year, to reduce its burden to $60.6 billion.
This year, it has held talks with Britain's Savannah Energy over properties in Chad and Cameroon https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/savannah-energy-talks-with-exxon-sell-some-africa-assets-2021-06-02/#:~:text=The%20British%20oil%20and%20gas,nearly%207%25%20at%2019.25%20pence and sold stakes in two deep water oilfields to Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and others.

Exxon is seeing new interest in its properties with this year's rebound in oil and gas prices, said Exxon Senior Vice President Jack Williams on July 30.
""That whole divestment discussion that we've had in the past continues,"" Williams said.

The company also initiated a variable return program to deliver 50% of free cash flow to shareholders on a quarterly basis, payable in the first quarter of 2022. 
Once the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, Chesapeake filed for court protection last June, saddled with more than $9 billion debt from overspending on assets and a sudden decline in oil prices.
After emerging from bankruptcy in February, Chesapeake endured senior management shakeups, with Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler leaving the company in April. It also said in June that three top executives would leave the company.
The company's net long-term debt stood at $1.26 billion as of June 30.
Chesapeake on Tuesday increased its expected 2021 adjusted EBIDAX (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and exploration expense) range by 16% to between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. 
The company also boosted its total annual production forecast to 415,000 to 435,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), from its previous range of 410,000 boepd to 420,00 boepd.
Chesapeake kept its full-year capital expenditure outlook unchanged at $670 million to $740 million.
The Oklahoma City-based oil and gas producer said it achieved an average net production rate of about 433,000 boepd in the second quarter.

It posted an adjusted profit of $1.64 per share for the quarter ended June 30, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.20, according to Refinitiv IBES.

(Reuters) -AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc shares reversed course to trade down 5.7% on Tuesday a day after it posted better-than-expected quarterly results and a deal with Warner Bros for an exclusive movie release period for cinemas.
Shares in the world's largest movie theater chain last traded at $31.87 after earlier rising as high as $37.16. 
Enthusiasm for the stock waned as the session wore on although AMC was still one of the top trending stocks on social media site Stocktwits suggesting a continued interest among retail investors. 
While the results topped Wall Street estimates, AMC still posted a huge loss and said ticket sales were well below pre-pandemic levels at just 29% of the second-quarter 2019. Some analysts raised financial estimates but kept neutral ratings.
""The financials are improving but they still have a long way to go to catch up to the lofty stock price,"" said 50 Park Investments Chief Executive Adam Sarhan.
""What happened in AMC earlier this year is not typical and that type of a monstrous move up usually means the stock got ahead of the fundamentals and it will take a lot of time before the fundamentals catch up.""
Earlier on Tuesday, founder of Kynikos Associates, Jim Chanos, explained on CNBC why he is bearish on the stock, questioning whether box office numbers would ever return to pre-pandemic levels given the increased popularity of streaming movies. 
""The reality is that things have gotten worse for this company. Clearly something has changed. That change is streaming,"" Chanos told CNBC.
However, AMC CEO Adam Aron said on Monday that the company had struck a deal with AT&T (NYSE:T)'s Warner Bros to allow a 45-day theatrical window for movies before their streaming release from 2022, instead of simultaneous release to home viewers.
Aron also said the company is in active talks with every major studio for such deals.
Theatrical exclusivity windows are crucial to box office sales and have long been in dispute between theater chains and studios, which are also trying to cash in on streaming.
The company said third-quarter U.S. ticket revenue was on track to reach 45% of third quarter 2019 levels, showing an improvement from the second quarter. In a nod to tech-savvy investors, Aron vowed to accept bitcoin as payment for tickets this year.
B. Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold raised his estimate for 2021 AMC revenue to $2.46 billion from $2.42 billion and upped his 2022 estimate to $4.75 billion from about $4.68 billion. 
Wold, who rates the stock neutral said ""strong box office trends, even in the face of day-and-date streaming availability, points to the potential for a strong 2022 rebound when more exclusive theatrical windows go into effect"". 

Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese also raised her 2021 revenue estimate but kept a neutral rating. In fact, most Wall Street analysts say AMC is over-valued, with the median price target on the stock at $3.70 - roughly a tenth of its current price.
Of nine analysts covering the stock, five recommend ""hold,"" while four have a ""sell"" rating and one rates it 'strong sell', according to Refinitiv.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 04:36PM ET</span>","Stocks strengthen; yields, dollar rise on Fed taper talk","By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global stock markets strengthened on Tuesday, hovering close to record highs, while U.S. Treasury yields rose to their highest levels since mid-July, spurred by Federal Reserve tapering talk.
Sentiment was boosted by the U.S. Senate passing a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that could provide the United States with its biggest investment in decades in roads, bridges, airports and waterways.
That helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 close at record highs. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 162.82 points, or 0.46%, to 35,264.67, the S&P 500 gained 4.4 points, or 0.10%, to 4,436.75 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 72.09 points, or 0.49%, to 14,788.09.
European shares extended gains for a seventh straight session as investors took comfort from strong earnings reports and economic recovery prospect.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.35%.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.12%, trading just off the record high it hit last week.
""Domestically and globally, we're seeing economies recovering from the pandemic. It's a good period for investing,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. 
The dollar scaled a four-month high versus the euro as investors looked ahead to U.S. inflation numbers on Wednesday for indications of when the world's largest economy might start to withdraw stimulus.
Activity, meanwhile, was heating up in bond markets.
Indications in recent days of an improving labor market have prompted investors to rethink the outlook for U.S. monetary policy, halting recent sharp falls in both U.S. and European bond yields.
Speculation is mounting that Fed Chair Jerome Powell could signal the U.S. central bank is ready to start easing monetary support in a speech to be delivered at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, conference of central bankers.
""Expectations have clearly shifted for Fed Chair Powell to turn hawkish at Jackson Hole and make a formal announcement on tapering asset purchases at the September FOMC meeting,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, using the acronym for the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
U.S. Treasury yields were also boosted by news that the infrastructure bill had been passed, while an auction of three-year notes produced strong results. The benchmark 10-year yield hit 1.349%, its highest level since July 15. 
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 9/32 in price to yield 1.3473%, from 1.317% late on Monday.
Adding fuel to the debate, two Fed officials said on Monday that, while the labor market still has room for improvement, inflation is already at a level that could satisfy one leg of a key test for the beginning of interest rate hikes.
Data on Monday showed that U.S. job openings shot up to a fresh record high in June and hiring also increased. 
That followed Friday's nonfarm payroll report showing jobs increased by a larger-than-anticipated 943,000 in July.
While signs of economic recovery in the United States are reviving reflation trade bets, investors remain wary of the lingering risks posed by COVID-19.
China on Monday reported more COVID-19 infections in what seems to be its most severe resurgence of the disease since mid-2020, as some cities added rounds of mass testing in a bid to stamp out infections.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.4% after trading much of the day in the red as worries weighed about the spread of the Delta variant.
With tapering expectations gaining traction, the dollar extended gains made on Friday and Monday. 
The dollar index rose 0.106%, with the euro down 0.17% to $1.1717.
Oil prices rose 3% on Tuesday, rebounding from recent losses on signs of rising demand in the United States [O/R]

""Overall, we are seeing that retail users are deepening their engagement with our platform...,"" the company said. ""On the institutional side, we now have over 9,000 financial institutions using Coinbase. Several important themes have developed with our institutional business."" 
Coinbase made its public market debut in April through a direct listing at $381 per share. The company's current business model, however, has come under security on concerns that increased competition will eventually drive the company's high trading fees, which make up the bulk of revenue, lower.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) hit a record high on Tuesday for the first time in more than 20 years as shares of COVID-19 vaccine makers have surged amid rising coronavirus cases in the United States.
Pfizer shares were last up 4.9% at $48.25, climbing as high as $48.57 during the session. The stock's previous intraday high was $47.44, reached on April 12, 1999.
The percentage gain was the stock's biggest one-day rise since Nov. 9, when Pfizer released positive data for its COVID-19 vaccine.
“I think they are finally getting credit for the vaccine,"" said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, which owns Pfizer shares. 
While investors had treated the vaccine before as ""a one-time cash infusion ... it is really going to be a durable business, unfortunately,"" Jonas said, adding that Pfizer should be able to leverage the vaccine's technology for use against other types of disease as well.
Pfizer's share gains come as those of another coronavirus vaccine maker,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, have also been on a tear.

U.S.-traded shares of Pfizer's partner on the vaccine, Germany's BioNTech, were down over 5% on Tuesday, but have climbed about 30% this month. 
Shares of  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), which last week delayed its timeline for its COVID-19 vaccine, were up 11% on Tuesday.
The rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus has pushed cases and hospitalizations in the United States to a six-month high.
""The Delta variant has scared a lot of people into getting inoculated,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel and an investor in Pfizer.

Pfizer in late July raised its 2021 sales forecast for its COVID-19 vaccine by 29% to $33.5 billion.
Ashtyn Evans, a healthcare analyst at Edward Jones, said Pfizer will be able to use the cash flow from the vaccine ""for both internal research and development and for acquisitions to strengthen their pipeline.""

For Ackman, this marks the first part of a promise to make good on his pledge to buy a sizable stake in UMG after the complex SPAC deal he put together crumbled last month amid scrutiny from U.S. regulators.
Ackman has told his own clients that music is the cheapest form of entertainment in the world and a savvy investment because it pays royalties.
His public and private hedge funds run by his firm Pershing Square Capital Management made this investment.
Ackman is currently raising fresh capital from investors to potentially buy more of UMG, according to people familiar with his plans.
""Vivendi is very satisfied with the arrival at UMG of Mr. Ackman, a major American investor, providing once again evidence of the music company's global success and attractiveness,"" Vivendi said.

UMG's enterprise value is worth more than the market value of its own parent company. The company, which represents artists like Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, is thriving on a music industry rebound, underpinned by booming streaming revenues but also a recent surge in sales of vinyl records and CDs.
Ackman's investment in UMG comes before a plan to list and spin off 60% of Universal to Vivendi shareholders.

Investing.com -- Stocks hovered near intraday highs on Tuesday as the long-awaited infrastructure bill passed in the Senate 69-30, which means Democrats got 19 Republicans to side with them.
The bill, which calls for more than $500 billion in additional federal spending on roads, bridges, railroads and broadband, now heads to the House of Representatives for consideration, where the odds of passage are slimmer. 
The prospect of billions of dollars going into the sectors that support the nation’s infrastructure -- from industrials to manufacturing to telecommunications -- buoyed stocks. 
Democrats also want to pass a $3.5 trillion budget that includes the other half of President Joe Biden’s agenda, namely a sweeping set of priorities aimed at easing poverty, improving access to education and health and personal care, and addressing climate change. 
Energy stocks led the broader-market gains on Tuesday, rebounding from a gloomy mood on Monday. Falling demand because of new travel restrictions in China to stop a new outbreak of Covid-19 cases continued to weigh on the oil market. 
While earnings are winding down, investors cheered the latest mostly positive reports. Movie chain operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC), which has become one of the high-profile meme stocks this year, reported a narrower than expected loss after Monday’s close on better than expected revenue.  
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. A glimpse at inflation
The consumer price index for July is due out from the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect a gain of 5.3% over last year, negligibly lower than June’s 5.4%. The June increase was the biggest monthly gain since August 2008.
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, is expected to have climbed 4.3% in July from a year ago against the 4.5% jump in June, which was the quickest pace of increase since September 1991.
2. eBay earnings
Online auction operator eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) reports earnings on Wednesday and is expected to announce per-share profit of 95 cents on revenue of $3 billion.
3. Lordstown Motors earnings
Lordstown Motors Corp (NASDAQ:RIDE) is seen posting a loss of 46 cents per share when it declares its second-quarter results on Wednesday.

The week started down due to ongoing concerns about peak economic growth and worries about the delta variant of the coronavirus. Stocks tied to the reopening of the economy were the biggest losers. Worries over new regulatory measures in China also seemed to weigh on investor sentiment. But positive earnings surprises helped the market regain its footing over the rest of the week. I will delve deeper into how these factors could impact the markets this week in my commentary below….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary from the POWR Value newsletter).
While COVID is a concern, the latest earnings, economic, and employment data paint a better picture. Friday's jobs report was solid, with nonfarm payroll employment rising rose by 943,000 in July. This was above consensus estimates and the best figure since lockdowns were eased last summer.
The unemployment rate also fell by 0.5 percentage points to 5.4 percent, a new pandemic-era low. The Institute for Supply Management reported that service sector activity rose a record 64.1% in July, up from 60.1% in the previous month and beating the consensus forecast of 60.5%.

347,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 02:40PM ET</span>",U.S. House bill would give tax credit for rare earth magnets,"(Reuters) - A Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation on Tuesday extending tax credits to companies that domestically produce rare earth magnets, a sector currently dominated by China.
The bill is the latest in a string of U.S. legislation attempting to cobble together a national strategy to produce more lithium, rare earths and other so-called strategic minerals used to make electric vehicles (EVs), weaponry and electronics. 
Representative Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, introduced the Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing Production Tax Credit Act, a bill co-sponsored by Representative Guy Reschenthaler, a Pennsylvania Republican.
The bill sets up a $20 per kilogram credit for neodymium iron boron magnets made in the United States, with the credit growing to $30 per kilogram for magnets made with rare earths sourced from American mines.
""As the Biden administration makes a strong commitment to vehicle electrification, it’s more important than ever that the United States secures all of the necessary components of the supply chain,"" said Swalwell, who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. presidential nomination in 2020. 
Swalwell and Reschenthaler had previously launched a bipartisan caucus https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mining-washington/u-s-house-launches-caucus-to-boost-strategic-minerals-production-idUSKCN24P1SK to focus on ways to increase domestic rare earths production. 
Rare earths are 17 metals that are difficult and costly to mine and process cleanly. MP Materials Corp's Mountain Pass mine in California is the only U.S. rare earths mine, but that facility relies on Chinese processors. 
There are no facilities in the United States to produce rare earths magnets. 
China is the world's largest producer of these minerals and magnets, and has threatened to stop their export to the United States.

The credit would be a boost to MP, which has said it aims to produce magnets at some point in the country, as well as privately held USA Rare Earth and other domestic projects.
""These credits would be a boost to U.S. manufacturing of rare earth permanent magnets essential to electric vehicles, as well as to U.S. defense and industrial supply chains,"" said Pini Althaus, chief executive of USA Rare Earth, which is developing a rare earths project in Texas.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 02:31PM ET</span>",Canadian Pacific challenges Canadian National with $27 billion Kansas City Southern bid,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) -Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd presented a new $27 billion offer for U.S. peer Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) on Tuesday, lower than a $29 billion rival bid from Canadian National Railway Co, hoping antitrust concerns over the latter will give it an edge.
 Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Chief Executive Keith Creel had refused to raise his previous $25 billion bid for Kansas City Southern after losing to Canadian National in May, arguing that the transaction that Kansas City Southern had chosen to pursue was ""not a real deal"" because the Surface Transportation Board (STB), the U.S. rail regulator, would shoot it down.
But with less than 10 days to go until Kansas City Southern shareholders are asked to vote on the deal with Canadian National on Aug. 19, the STB has yet to rule on the proposed ""voting trust"" structure of that transaction. A voting trust insulates the acquisition target from the acquirer's control until the STB clears the deal on a permanent basis.
Canadian Pacific had been hoping that the STB would come out against Canadian National's bid by now, according to people familiar with the matter. The STB said on Tuesday it would announce its decision on the Canadian National voting trust by Aug. 31.
Another consideration behind Canadian Pacific's u-turn was the opinion of influential proxy advisory firms, the sources said. Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis recommended that Kansas City shareholders vote in favor of the Canadian National, but left the window open for them to revise their opinions if Canadian Pacific came in with a new bid.
""As Canadian Pacific went out telling (Kansas City Southern shareholders) to vote no, the feedback they got from investors was there was no other offer from you to help us make a decision,"" said Cowen analyst Jason Seidl.
The acquisition of Kansas City Southern by either of its Canadian peers would create the first direct railway linking Canada, the United States and Mexico. 
Canadian National Railway has said it will divest Kansas City Southern's 70-mile rail line between New Orleans and Baton Rouge to eliminate overlap between the two railroad operators. It has agreed to pay a $1 billion fee to Kansas City Southern should regulators shoot down their deal.
Canadian Pacific argues that Canadian National and Kansas City compete for the business of different shippers and terminals in the same region that would lose out should the merger go through. It also points out that the STB has greenlighted its voting trust structure for a deal with Kansas City Southern.
In a statement on Tuesday announcing the new Canadian Pacific bid, Creel cited U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order on ""Promoting Competition in the American Economy"" as making the Canadian National deal less likely. 
Biden has nominated Karen Hedlund, a former Federal Railroad Administration deputy administrator, to be a board member of the STB. U.S. lawmakers could approve her nomination in the fall, making it more likely that the STB would take a tougher stance on antitrust if it has not approved the Canadian National deal by then.
KANSAS CITY SHARES RISE
Canadian Pacific's sweetened $300 per share offer consists of $90 in cash and 2.884 of its shares for each share of Kansas City. Canadian National's cash-and-stock bid is currently worth around $321 per share.
Kansas City Southern shares had been trading at a wide discount to the Canadian National deal price, reflecting investor uncertainty over the transaction's regulatory prospects. They were up 7% on Tuesday afternoon at $288.77, indicating that investors saw Canadian Pacific's chances for a deal improving. 
Shares of Canadian Pacific and Canadian National dropped by 1.5% and 1% respectively. 
Kansas City Southern said in a statement that its board of directors will evaluate Canadian Pacific's proposal and respond in due course. It has the power to delay the shareholder vote on the Canadian National bid, and it would scrap it altogether were it to opt for Canadian Pacific's offer.

Canadian National said in a statement that it and Kansas City Southern were confident that their voting trust meets all the standards set by the STB and that it should be approved ""after a fair and thorough review by the STB."" 
Canadian Pacific said in its statement it has offered to pay back a $700 million break-up fee received from Kansas City Southern when it abandoned their first deal in May. It has also offered to make Kansas City Southern whole for a $700 million break-up fee it would have to pay Canadian National to abandon the latest deal.

355,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 01:46PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. weighs 2050 target in bid to wean airlines off fossil fuels,"By Allison Lampert and Stephanie Kelly
(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is quietly discussing a target date of 2050 for weaning aircraft off fossil fuels as part of the White House's broader push to fight climate change, sources familiar with the matter said.
The White House in recent days has stepped up efforts aimed at transforming the U.S. economy, including promotion of climate-directed infrastructure spending and bringing auto companies on board for its push for more electric vehicle use.
The Biden administration is contemplating incentives to support private-sector production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as it searches for ways to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions in the hard-to-electrify aviation industry. 
The administration is looking at a 2050 target for airlines to fly on 100% jet fuel from renewable sources, said two sources, who spoke anonymously to be candid about the discussions.
The discussions are still in the early stages with few details available, the sources said. The United States and Europe are trying to find ways to encourage production and adoption of SAF, which is two to five times more expensive than standard jet fuel. 
Sustainable aviation fuel, made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and animal fat, at present accounts for only a miniscule amount of overall jet fuel use. 
The administration confirmed that SAF is on its radar but did not comment on or confirm the 2050 target. 
""As part of the Build Back Better agenda, President Biden proposed catalytic investments to propel innovation and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels,"" said Ali Zaidi, the Deputy National Climate Advisor for the White House. 
""The administration is committed to advancing climate solutions in every sector and segment of the economy - with the urgency that the climate crisis demands.""
CARROT AND STICK
The aviation sector cannot count on electrification as a near-term solution because of the weight of the batteries. 
Biden's administration, which has set a goal for net-zero emissions by 2050, has discussed incentives and targets to increase SAF. It is currently taking a different approach than Europe, where regulators are seeking to force suppliers to blend rising amounts of SAF into their kerosene, a move opposed by U.S. airlines.
The White House and industry groups are expected to meet virtually later this month to promote alternative jet fuels, although specific actions that might be taken are not clear, three sources said.
Environmentalists say a European-style mandate is needed to raise production and bring down SAF's price. However, Angel Alvarez Alberdi, secretary general of the European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association, fears the EU's mandate will redirect the limited pool of affordable feedstocks available to make SAF.
""It could be a debate around the carrot and the stick,"" John Slattery, head of engine maker GE Aviation, a unit of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, said of SAF demand during a recent Eurocontrol podcast.
SMALL MARKET
Global demand for jet fuel currently totals roughly 200 billion liters a year, but airline trade group IATA estimates just 100 million to 120 million liters of SAF will be produced in 2021 - just 0.05% of overall fuel.
Planes and engines capable of running without fossil fuels are being planned for around 2025 and 2030, depending on the model. Current engines can theoretically run on 50% sustainable blends.
It is not yet clear whether government efforts will succeed at making sustainable fuel more affordable for pandemic-battered airlines. Fuel is the second-largest expense for airlines after labor. 
Refiners make more renewable diesel right now because federal and state governments offer more incentives, such as California's credit of 45 cents per gallon.
Congress is debating a tax credit of up to $2 per gallon for SAF. If such a credit were available, World Energy, the largest U.S. SAF producer, would be able to sell its SAF for roughly the same as conventional fuel, said Bryan Sherbacow, the company's chief commercial officer.

World Energy's Los Angeles-area plant uses around a third of its 25 million-gallon annual capacity for making aviation fuel, with the rest producing other renewable fuel. The company is betting on SAF becoming more affordable, as it is boosting the plant's SAF capacity to around 150 million gallons by 2023. 
If incentives were balanced, ""we would probably be making a lot more jet fuel,"" Sherbacow said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Google employees based in the same office before the pandemic could see different changes in pay if they switch to working from home permanently, with long commuters hit harder, according to a company pay calculator seen by Reuters.
It is an experiment taking place across Silicon Valley, which often sets trends for other large employers.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter also cut pay for remote employees who move to less expensive areas, while smaller companies including Reddit and Zillow have shifted to location-agnostic pay models, citing advantages when it comes to hiring, retention and diversity.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google stands out in offering employees a calculator that allows them to see the effects of a move. But in practice, some remote employees, especially those who commute from long distances, could experience pay cuts without changing their address.
""Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from,"" a Google spokesperson said, adding that pay will differ from city to city and state to state.
One Google employee, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation, typically commutes to the Seattle office from a nearby county and would likely see their pay cut by about 10% by working from home full-time, according estimates by the company's Work Location Tool launched in June. 
The employee was considering remote work but decided to keep going to the office - despite the two-hour commute. ""It's as high of a pay cut as I got for my most recent promotion. I didn't do all that hard work to get promoted to then take a pay cut,"" they said.
Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who researches pay determination, said Google's pay structure raises alarms about who will feel the impacts most acutely, including families.
""What's clear is that Google doesn't have to do this,"" Rosenfeld said. ""Google has paid these workers at 100% of their prior wage, by definition. So it's not like they can't afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving.""
Screenshots of Google's internal salary calculator seen by Reuters show that an employee living in Stamford, Connecticut - an hour from New York City by train - would be paid 15% less if she worked from home, while a colleague from the same office living in New York City would see no cut from working from home. Screenshots showed 5% and 10% differences in the Seattle, Boston and San Francisco areas.
Interviews with Google employees indicate pay cuts as high as 25% for remote work if they left San Francisco for an almost as expensive area of the state such as Lake Tahoe. 
The calculator states it uses U.S. Census Bureau metropolitan statistical areas, or CBSAs. Stamford, Connecticut, for example, is not in New York City's CBSA, even though many people who live there work in New York. 

A Google spokesperson said the company will not change an employee's salary based on them going from office work to being fully remote in the city where the office is located. Employees working in the New York City office will be paid the same as those working remotely from another New York City location, for example, according to the spokesperson.
Google did not specifically address the issue for commuters from areas such as Stamford, Connecticut.

Let’s discuss.Most companies providing cloud-based services grew exponentially last year as COVID-19 pandemic-led restrictions compelled most businesses to operate remotely. Furthermore, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases owing to the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus has lead to the re-imposition of restrictions in several parts of the world, which should further increase the demand for cloud-based services.
With continuous innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the cloud industry is expected to grow exponentially. According to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global cloud computing market is expected to grow at a 17.9% CAGR between 2021 - 2028. While it may be risky to bet on a particular cloud stock with rising competition in the cloud space and increasing vulnerability to cyber-attacks, a less risky way could be to bet on cloud-stock-focused ETFs.
So, we think cloud-based ETFs First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN), First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY), and Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU) could be solid bets now. These ETFs are rated A (which translates to Strong Buy) in our proprietary POWR Ratings system.

Investing.com – ADRs of hotel owner InterContinental Hotels Group (NYSE:IHG) traded 0.7% lower Tuesday as the chain decided to drop the interim dividend for 2021 even as it swung to an operating profit in the first half of the year.
The company said its board is confident “the proven highly cash generative nature of our business model will allow resumption of dividend payments in due course”.
IHG today declared its results for the first half ended June 30.
The hotel operator reported sequential monthly improvement in both occupancy and rate since March. As per the company, about half of its hotels in July reported revenue per available room, a key performance indicator, above pre-pandemic levels. RevPAR grew 20% compared to last year.
The chain closed the first half with 884,000 rooms across 5,994 hotels.
Recovery was most pronounced in Greater China, but leisure bookings in the U.S., IHG’s biggest market, continue to be strong, the company said.
It said Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia markets are still a challenge and regional performances will reflect variations in both vaccine rollout progress and travel restrictions.
Things had ""gotten tougher"" in markets such as Australia and Japan, Chief Financial Officer and Group Head of Strategy Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson said, adding that recent domestic travel restrictions in China would have a short-term impact on IHG, Reuters reported.
IHG reported an operating profit of $138 million compared to a loss of $233 million a year earlier. Revenue fell 6% to $1.17 billion.

A California appeals court late on Monday upheld an $86 million verdict that found Bayer responsible for a couple's cancer after using Bayer's glyphosate-based Roundup against weeds.
Bayer in February 2020 filed an appeal, saying the verdict could not be reconciled with sound science or with product clearance from the federal environment regulator.
Roundup-related lawsuits have dogged the company since it acquired the brand as part of its $63 billion purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
""We respectfully disagree with the Court’s ruling as the verdict is not supported by the evidence at trial or the law. Monsanto will consider its legal options in this case,"" Bayer said in a statement.
It reaffirmed plans to file a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court this month to review a similar Roundup case that went in favour of Roundup user Edwin Hardeman.
Bayer struck a settlement deal in principle with plaintiffs last year but failed to win court approval for a separate agreement on how to handle future cases, as Bayer intended to keep the product on the market.
Last month, it announced an additional litigation provision of $4.5 billion to brace for any unfavourable ruling by the top U.S. court. That came on top of $11.6 billion it previously set aside for settlements and litigation in the matter.
Among measures to contain the legal damage, Bayer plans to replace glyphosate in weedkillers for the U.S. residential market with other active ingredients. It will continue to sell the herbicide to farmers, who rely on it heavily.
""We continue to stand strongly behind the safety of Roundup, a position supported by four decades of extensive science and the assessments of leading health regulators worldwide that support its safe use,"" Bayer added in its statement on Tuesday.
An initial verdict in 2019 drew attention after a California jury awarded more than $2 billion to Roundup users Alberta and Alva Pilliod. The trial judge later reduced the damages to $86 million.

The setback for Bayer comes after a federal appeals court in May upheld a $25 million court verdict which ruled Roundup caused the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of California resident Edwin Hardeman.
About a year ago, Bayer failed to persuade a California appeals https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-glyphosate-lawsuit-idUSKCN24M2BT court to overturn a verdict favouring school groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson who claimed Roundup use caused his cancer.

(Reuters) -The takeover battle between tobacco giant Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) and private equity firm Carlyle for inhaled treatments maker Vectura will not be heading to the auction ring on Wednesday after Carlyle said it will not raise its bid.
U.S.-based Carlyle on Tuesday declared final its 155 pence per Vectura share offer, which it sweetened last week to value the British company at about 958 million pounds ($1.33 billion). The proposal is below an increased 165 pence bid from Philip Morris on Sunday.
Britain's takeover regulator on Monday had intervened in the battle, saying that it would enter a rare head-to-head auction https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-takeover-regulator-intervenes-battle-drugmaker-vectura-2021-08-09 if the bidders do not make final bids by Tuesday 1600 GMT (1700 BST).
Only a handful of British takeover fights have gone to auction, with the highest profile in recent years being the battle in 2018 for pay-television group Sky when Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) emerged as the winner of a single-day three round blind auction.
London-listed shares of Vectura closed at 163.4 pence on Tuesday after hitting a more than five-year high of 176 pence earlier in the session. They have gained 33% in value since Carlyle's first offer in May. 
Vectura has been the target of several approaches since May from the U.S.-based groups, which are eyeing the drugmaker's expertise with inhalable formulations and device designs for respiratory therapies for illnesses such as asthma.
The London-listed company had voiced its support for the Carlyle offer last week, saying that it may be better positioned under the ownership of the private equity firm, while noting the uncertainties that could arise for its stakeholders as a result of being owned by the Marlboro cigarette-maker. 
However, Vectura withdrew its backing and also withheld support for the higher offer from Philip Morris following the intervention from the Takeover Panel.
Vectura did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A deal with either one of the U.S. companies would require shareholder approval.

For years, consumers have sued the world's largest online retailer, arguing it is liable when a merchant sells bad products on Amazon.com. A woman in Pennsylvania, for instance, in 2016 sought to blame Amazon for a merchant's retractable dog leash that blinded her eye when it snapped.
Amazon maintains that sellers themselves are responsible, and most courts have ruled in its favor https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/amazon-not-liable-third-partys-product-says-texas-top-court-2021-06-28. A state appellate court in California, however, last year said it could be liable for goods it stores and ships via its Fulfillment by Amazon program.

Effective Sept. 1, Amazon will pay valid claims of up to $1,000, which make up more than 80% of injury and damage cases on its platform, at no cost to sellers, and it may step in with more help if sellers are unresponsive, the company said. The policy ""better protects Amazon customers and sellers,"" it said.
It also announced Amazon Insurance Accelerator, a network of insurance providers that sellers can access if they choose, and an updated policy requiring more merchants to obtain product liability insurance. Amazon itself is not offering this insurance, it said.

And now that the rapidly spreading COVID-19 Delta variant has shifted investor attention back again to the healthcare industry, the sector is projected to grow considerably in the coming months. Consequently, we believe it would be prudent to invest in some of the top-performing Dow Jones healthcare stocks—Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Merck & Co. (MRK), and Amgen (AMGN). Let’s discuss.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) hit its 35208.51 all-time high last week, driven by a stronger-than-expected jobs report. The U.S. economy added 943,000 jobs in July. Because the jobs report soothed investors’ concerns about the economic recovery, shares of companies tied to the economic comeback have since risen significantly.
Meanwhile, the rapid spread of the highly infectious COVID-19 Delta variant has rekindled investors’ interest in the healthcare industry. This, along with the rising demand for therapeutics, rapid adoption of virtual health and digital innovations, and the aging population, should continue to drive the industry’s growth. In addition, increasing government support to improve healthcare infrastructure is further anticipated to propel the industry's growth. Investors’ interest in healthcare stocks is evident in the Vanguard Health Care ETF’s (VHT) 7.7% returns over the past three months.
Because the healthcare industry tends to be non-cyclical, we believe quality healthcare stocks on the Dow Jones Index—Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK), and  Amgen Inc . (NASDAQ:AMGN)—could be best bets now.

Read on.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped to an all-time high last week on investor optimism about tech stocks amid the second-quarter earnings season, with companies beating estimates at a record rate. The accelerated pace of digital transformation around the globe continues to favor the technology industry amid concerns over the rapidly spreading COVID-19 Delta variant.
The technology industry has mostly been resilient in the face of the pandemic, rewarding investors with solid returns. This is evidenced by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 35.7% gains over the past year. The industry has benefited largely from rapid digitization and growing reliance on tech products and solutions for working from home, digital payments, and the digitization of healthcare, to name a few areas. In fact, the increasing use of cloud computing and continuous innovations in AI, machine learning, and IoT are likely to create massive opportunities for the industry in the coming months.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 12:01PM ET</span>","Dominion sues Newsmax, One America over U.S. election fraud claims","By Jan Wolfe and Tom Hals
(Reuters) -Dominion Voting Systems Corp on Tuesday sued two conservative media networks, One America News Network and Newsmax Media Inc, saying they defamed the U.S. voting machine company by spreading false claims that it rigged the 2020 election against then-U.S. President Donald Trump.
Dominion also filed a lawsuit making similar allegations against businessman Patrick Byrne, the former chief executive of online retailer  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK) Inc.
The lawsuits are the latest legal actions taken by Denver-based Dominion against Trump allies that amplified false theories about the firm.
In each of the three lawsuits filed on Monday, Dominion is seeking more than $1.6 billion in damages, citing lost profits and other harms.
In a statement, Newsmax said, ""While Newsmax has not reviewed the Dominion filing, in its coverage of the 2020 Presidential elections, Newsmax simply reported on allegations made by well-known public figures, including the President, his advisors and members of Congress — Dominion’s action today is a clear attempt to squelch such reporting and undermine a free press.""
Fox made similar arguments in a May court filing asking a judge to dismiss the case against it, saying that news outlets ""must be able to report both sides of a story involving claims striking at the core of our democracy."" 
Newsmax in April apologized to a Dominion employee for baselessly alleging that he rigged the company's vote counts against Trump. In exchange, the employee, Eric Coomer, dropped Newsmax from a defamation lawsuit.
OANN representatives and Byrne did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Trump continues to falsely claim that he lost to Democratic President Joe Biden due to rampant electoral fraud, claims that were rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of his own administration.
Trump allies, including lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, picked up an online conspiracy theory that Dominion machines were used to hack the election, and made those baseless allegations during appearances on the conservative television stations.
Giuliani and Powell, who have also been sued by Dominion, say they were lawfully exercising their free speech rights.

In a call with reporters, Dominion attorney Stephen Shackelford of the Susman Godfrey law firm did not rule out suing Trump.
""We are still exploring options as to how to hold other participants in the campaign of lies accountable,"" Shackelford said.

The trend is likely to continue as the worldwide market soars with major economies emerging from recession. And we think this supply/demand imbalance should help shipping companies ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM),  Matson  (NYSE:MATX), and Danaos (NYSE:DAC) generate higher profits in the coming months. Let’s discuss.Global supply chain bottlenecks amid soaring demand and a container shortage have caused a substantial increase in shipping costs. In addition, the Suez Canal blockage earlier this year exacerbated the container shortage in the first half of 2021.
According to Drewry Shipping Consultants, the average cost of chartering a 40-feet steel container from Shanghai to Rotterdam is currently 547% higher than the past five-year seasonal average. The rising shipping costs are expected to contribute to increasing inflation.
Analysts expect shipping costs to rise further in the coming months as global demand increases with the fast-paced economic recovery. This should allow shipping companies to generate higher profits as oil prices remain under pressure. Thus, we think popular shipping companies ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd.(ZIM), Matson, Inc.(MATX), and Danaos Corporation(DAC) should grow substantially in the near term.

Real Madrid also said they would pursue legal action to block approval of the planned deal, which is to be voted on by La Liga members. 
The league said last week that the deal, called ""Boost La Liga"", would strengthen its clubs and give them funds to spend on new infrastructure and modernisation projects as well as increasing how much they could spend on players' salaries.
Real and Barcelona, however, have fiercely opposed the deal as it gives CVC a 10% share in the league's future television rights.
Tebas responded to the statement with a message on Twitter in which he criticised Real president Florentino Perez for using ""threatening methods"".
CVC Capital Partners said ""the legal action announcement is totally disproportionate and manifestly unfounded"", adding that it reserved the right to take any available legal action to defend itself.
In a statement sent shortly after Real Madrid announced the legal action, CVC said it hoped La Liga's member clubs would approve the deal, which it described as ""beneficial to all"".
Barcelona president Joan Laporta last week said the deal was like ""mortgaging the club's rights over the next half-century"" and said he would reject it, even though it would have helped alleviate the Catalans' financial problems and allowed them to sign Lionel Messi, who has left Barca, to a new contract.

The Spanish league last week said it was not worried by legal moves from Real Madrid and that legal disputes between the two entities were common.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 11:06AM ET</span>",Boeing delivers 28 airplanes in July; 787s still halted,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday it handed over 28 airplanes to buyers in July as revived domestic travel fuels 737 MAX deliveries, but the U.S. planemaker's 787 remained in inventory for a fourth month due to defects. 
The closely watched monthly orders and deliveries snapshot comes as Boeing bids to recoup billions of dollars in lost sales from the coronavirus pandemic, and move beyond the safety scandal caused by two fatal 737 MAX crashes.
Of the aircraft Boeing delivered to airlines and other buyers in July, 22 were 737 MAX single-aisle jets, one was a P-8 maritime patrol aircraft for the U.S. Navy, and the remaining five were widebodies. The widebodies included one KC-46 tanker to the U.S. Air Force and four freighters. 
As well as aiming to raise 737 MAX deliveries, Boeing is also dealing with structural defects of its bigger, more profitable 787 planes, deliveries of which have been halted twice since 2020. Boeing has been forced to cut production, though it has on occasion handed over the jet to buyers.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed on July 12 that some undelivered Boeing 787s have a new manufacturing quality issue the planemaker will need fix before the planes will be delivered. A source told Reuters that it may be at least several more weeks before the issue is resolved.
Deliveries are financially important to planemakers because airlines pay most of the purchase price when they actually receive the aircraft.
Boeing is eying a strong recovery in domestic travel in the United States and other markets, though international passenger travel remains depressed. 
It has delivered 154 737 MAX jets since that aircraft returned to service in November 2020 following a nearly two-year safety ban after the fatal crashes. 
Overall, Boeing delivered 184 jetliners for the year through July, according to the latest data made available by the planemaker.
Boeing said it received orders in July for 31 aircraft, including 19 of its 737 MAX jets, and 12 of its larger widebodies.
However, airlines in July cancelled orders for 17 jets, including 15 MAXs and two 787s. For the first half of the year, Boeing also removed 11 of its 787s from its backlog after applying stricter accounting standards to previously booked orders. 

Factoring in cancelled orders, instances where a buyer converted to another jet model and accounting adjustments, Boeing's order tally for July stood at 14 – the sixth straight month of positive net orders for Boeing.
Overall, Boeing's total backlog decreased by 14 jets to 4,141 aircraft in July, from 4,155 at the end of June, it said.

Investing.com – Casper stock (NYSE:CSPR) slumped 17% Tuesday after the company reported widening of losses in the second quarter as higher raw material prices and operating expenses outweighed the rise in revenue.
Revenue rose 38% year-on-year to $151.75 million to beat expectations but that wasn’t good enough to overcome the 49% jump in cost of goods sold and 33% rise in operating expenses.
As a result, the net loss expanded to $33.74 million from $24.20 million in June quarter of 2020.
Prices of practically all the raw materials like cotton, foam, latex and plastics that go into making Casper’s pillows, mattresses, beddings and other products have risen as economies have boomed and consumers have looked to beef up their homes. Supply chain bottlenecks because of the lockdown have also inflated prices.
The company tweaked its forecast a little though it kept the revenue outlook unchanged. For 2021, the company expects revenue of approximately $580 million to $610 million, the same forecast it gave in May.
But the company added that it expects to achieve adjusted profitability before taxes, interest and other items during 2022, assuming manufacturing and supply chain capacity increases, materials shortages, labor and shipping constraints lessen, and inflationary pressure on input materials subsides."

SEOUL/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Shares in Krafton Inc, the Tencent Holdings-backed South Korean company behind blockbuster video game ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" (PUBG), fell as much as 20% on their trading debut on Tuesday.
Analysts attributed the share tumble of South Korea's second-largest IPO to an expensive valuation and China regulation risks, with gaming companies facing uncertain prospects after China regulators have come down hard on a number of industries, upending norms with new guidance and rules. 
Krafton shares opened down 9.9% from their IPO price of 498,000 won, making it South Korea's lowest trading debut since LG Philips LCD, now LG Display (NYSE:LPL), first went public in 2004, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon. 
The stock closed down 8.8% from the IPO price, valuing the company at about $19.32 billion. 
""This was a classic case of the owners being a bit too greedy in their valuation assessment of the company. Although the IPO price range was lowered, it was not lowered enough,"" said Douglas Kim, an independent analyst, who publishes on Smartkarma.
Krafton derived 87% of its revenue from Asia excluding South Korea in the January-March quarter, a large portion of which is estimated by analysts to come from sales in China handled by Tencent. 
Krafton earns fees by providing technology services for ""Peacekeeper Elite"", a game similar to ""PUBG Mobile"" that Tencent distributes and is usually among China's top two grossing games, it said in an IPO filing. 
""About 70% (of sales) appear to be from Tencent,"" LightStream Research analyst Mio Kato, who publishes on Smartkarma, told Reuters. 
""China has already made noises about (Tencent's) 'Honor of Kings' ... If they also request changes for 'Peacekeeper Elite' that would be a negative and could be a very large negative."" 
Shares in Tencent and global gaming companies with China exposure such as Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) tumbled last week after the Economic Information Daily, which is affiliated with the official Xinhua Agency, called online gaming ""spiritual opium"".
Tencent quickly said it would further curb minors' access to its flagship video game ""Honor of Kings"".
Still, Krafton raised $3.75 billion in South Korea's second-largest IPO after Samsung (KS:005930) Life Insurance's float in 2010, even after the firm cut its fund-raising target by a quarter after regulators ordered it to revise its filings. 
Based on market capitalisation, Krafton was benchmark KOSPI's 19th biggest stock on Tuesday, excluding preferred shares. 
Some 65% of the IPO proceeds will go to Krafton, which plans to use the bulk of the funds to acquire other gaming companies. The remainder went to shareholders cashing out their investments.

More large offerings are in the pipeline in what is shaping up to be a bumper year for South Korean stock market floats, including EV battery maker LG Energy Solution and payments firm Kakao Pay, which is backed by China's Ant Financial.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman who accused billionaire Leon Black of sexual violence and defamation is now alleging the former Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc chief once flew her to Florida for a potential sexual encounter with Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and sex offender.
Guzel Ganieva's latest accusation came in an amended civil complaint filed on Monday in a New York state court.
The Russian model had sued Black on June 1, and Black countersued for defamation on July 19. Both are seeking unspecified damages.
""Ms. Ganieva's story today is demonstrably and transparently false and betrays her willingness to say anything and fabricate a story in the hope that something will stick,"" Danya Perry, a lawyer for Black, said in a statement on Monday.
Ganieva, now in her late 30s, previously accused Black of numerous instances of unwanted sexual conduct before having her sign a nondisclosure agreement in 2015, and defamation for publicly accusing her of trying to extort him.
Black's lawyers have said their client, who is married, had a consensual 6-1/2-year relationship with Ganieva, and paid her $100,000 a month for several years not to discuss it.
In Monday's complaint, Ganieva said Black picked her up in October 2008, purportedly for a lunch in Manhattan, but instead took her on a private jet to Florida, where Epstein had a home.
The complaint said Epstein had been on work release, after pleading guilty to a Florida state prostitution charge.
It said that after Ganieva met Epstein, and ""it became clear that Ms. Ganieva would not be engaging in sex with Epstein, Epstein and Black became angry and upset with Ms. Ganieva.""
Perry said in her statement that she had asked a judge to order the production of ""documentary evidence that will expose Ms. Ganieva and unmask her confederates and their illegal conduct."" 
Jeanne Christensen, a lawyer for Ganieva, said in a statement the amended complaint exposed Black's counterclaims as an attempt ""to inflict extreme pain upon Ms. Ganieva while making good on his threats to destroy her life.""
Black, 70, stepped down as Apollo's chief executive and chairman this year after an independent review by the Dechert law firm said he paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning.

The review found Black was not involved with Epstein's criminal activities. Black said at the time he deeply regretted his involvement with Epstein.
Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Consequently, EV battery stocks QuantumScape (QS) and Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) could see increasing demand for their products. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.California-based development-stage company QuantumScape Corporation (QS) develops and commercializes solid-state lithium-metal batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and other applications. Panasonic Corporation (PCRFY) is a Japan-based electronics company that operates through four segments: Appliance; Eco Solutions; Connected Solutions; and Automotive and Industrial Systems. Its offerings include automotive-use batteries, refrigerators, and industrial motors and sensors.

(Reuters) - Dire warnings about climate change are a call to action for investors who put their money into helping the environment. But the news also heightens a debate about how to make these strategies effective, financial executives said.
A U.N climate report on Monday found that global warming is dangerously close to spiraling out of control. Even the most severe carbon emission cuts are unlikely to prevent global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures by 2040, a level that many scientists believe must be achieved to avert catastrophic climate change.
Green investing has attracted a flood of cash and boosted companies like electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and clean energy company NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) that promise to help a transition away from fossil fuels.
But sustainable investment managers are confronting a two-sided challenge for ESG, or environmental, social and governance, funds.
Fund managers want to convert public enthusiasm into dollars invested while simultaneously allaying suspicions that some funds are ""greenwashed"" as skeptics claim. 
""Not all ESG funds are created equal and investors must do their research to determine whether their investments are making a real impact or are simply feeding into an ESG-centered marketing push,"" said Green Century Capital Management President Leslie Samuelrich.
NEW GREEN HIGH
Globally, sustainable funds hit a record high of $2.24 trillion in assets in the second quarter, Morningstar data showed, up 12% from the end of March. 
Many of these funds choose their investments in part on ratings of portfolio companies' sustainability assigned by outside firms, but these grades can diverge widely.
An association of global market regulators took the first step last month towards governing the ratings. [L8N2OZ2YS] The U.N. report will further pressure funds to make their climate disclosures more transparent, said R. Paul Herman, chief executive of sustainable ratings agency HIP Investor.
Another challenge is finding green investment opportunities in emerging markets, which have fallen behind in curbing emissions. China, for example, said last year it would seek carbon neutrality by 2060, a decade later than other top economies.
Just 2% of the money tracked by Morningstar has gone to funds based in Asian countries other than Japan.
Randeep Somel, manager of the M&G Climate Solutions Fund in London, said more government focus on curbing emissions in those countries would inspire confidence among investors.
""Once governments start to move in emerging markets, you will see companies moving more quickly,"" Somel said.
HOW TO HANDLE FOSSIL FUEL?
One of the biggest questions is whether to invest in fossil fuels at all. An increasing number of asset managers, such as Green Century, and pension funds, such as those of Maine and New York City, have said they won't. Others argue it is better to work with energy companies to spur change.
""It's easy to exclude coal companies or bad actors from your portfolio and only invest in companies that are green. The real impact comes from taking high carbon emitters and forcing them to modify their behavior,"" said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer of Angeles Investment Advisors. 
Angeles, which manages $7 billion in assets, would still own an oil company if it took climate change seriously, Rosen added.
Mark Hays, director of sustainable investing for Glenmede of Philadelphia, said an earlier UN climate report in 2019 drew attention from mainstream investors. Monday's report could spur more action, he said.

Climate change ""is going to be increasingly financially material to your investment portfolio,"" Hays said

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), the world's second-largest carmaker, is calling for lower import duties on electric cars in India to help drive demand for clean vehicles, echoing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s recent pitch which has divided the country's auto industry.
Cutting duties on electric vehicles (EVs) even to 25% - from current levels as high as 100% - would not pose a ""big threat"" to domestic players, but would help to drive investment, the German carmaker's India head told Reuters in an interview. 
""The market for EVs has to be big enough for investments to come in and for that we shouldn't be placing barriers,"" Gurpratap Boparai, managing director of Skoda Auto Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) India, said.
The German carmaker is exploring EVs for India from its Volkswagen and Skoda brands, but would need to see lower import duties, stable policies on taxation and long-term incentives to take the plunge, Boparai said. Development of charging infrastructure will also influence its decision. 
India taxes fully-built imported cars, including EVs, as high as 100%, but the government is discussing a proposal to slash rates to as low as 40%, days after Tesla Inc's appeals for a cut.
This has triggered fissures in the auto industry, with global players such as Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai Motor supporting the proposed cuts, but domestic rivals like  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) opposing them, saying they would hurt India's push to increase local production.
""I'm not at all saying that local manufacturing should not be encouraged ... but duty of 60% and 100% is prohibitively high at this juncture,"" said Boparai, adding that to manufacture EVs locally there first needed to be more demand. 
Volkswagen, which aims to overtake Tesla as the world's largest EV maker by 2025, is investing billions of dollars to transition to battery-powered cars, which it expects to account for half of its global vehicle sales by 2030.
While India, the world's fifth-largest car market, is on Volkswagen's EV map, Boparai expects a lag in electrification compared with Europe and China because of the high price of battery-powered cars and lack of local charging infrastructure. 
In July, Volkswagen began sales of three Audi electric SUVs priced from about $133,0000, putting them out of reach of most buyers in India where 95% of cars are sold for less than $20,000. Next year, it plans to launch its luxury Porsche Taycan EV in India.

Boparai said he expected demand to begin at the high end of the market and trickle down, as seen in markets like the United States where Tesla dominates electric car sales. But in India there was also a need for affordable EVs and demand for that would begin with ride-hailing or corporate fleets, he added. 
""Establishing EVs is a lot of hard work. Not really having a clear roadmap and not reducing duties will slow progress towards EVs - both adoption as well as manufacturing,"" he said.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 08:51AM ET</span>",BioNTech alone could lift German economy by 0.5% this year,"BERLIN (Reuters) -The development and domestic production of a groundbreaking COVID-19 vaccine by German start-up BioNTech could boost economic growth in Europe's largest economy by up to 0.5 percentage points this year, an economist said on Tuesday.
The German economy is seen growing by roughly 4% this year following a pandemic-related plunge by 4.6% last year. This means that BionTech and its breakthrough development of a coronavirus vaccine based on mRNA technology could account for roughly an eighth of overall GDP growth in 2021, based on estimates by Sebastian Dullien, head of think tank the Macroeconomic Policy Institute (IMK). 
""I can't think of another example in which a single company had such an impact on German GDP,"" Dullien told Reuters.
A government official said it was absolutely plausible to assume that the BioNTech effect on overall economic growth would easily reach up to 0.5 percentage points this year.
Dullien said that as a macro economist, he normally does not look at individual companies. ""Sometimes, however, there are rare cases in which individual companies have macroeconomic relevance. BioNTech is such a rare example,"" Dullien said.
His calculations are based on BioNTech's latest earnings released on Monday which showed the start-up now expects to accrue 15.9 billion euros ($18.63 billion) in revenue from the vaccine this year, up from an earlier estimate of 12.4 billion euros. 
That is roughly 0.5% of German GDP, Dullien said. In 2020, Germany's gross domestic product stood at about 3.3 trillion euros.
""Since BioNTech procures relatively few preliminary products from abroad, this is almost entirely domestic added value,"" Dullien said. ""So this has a direct impact on economic growth.""
In contrast to Germany's big car companies that produce many vehicles outside the country, BioNTech is producing its vaccine in a factory in Marburg, in western Germany. In addition, it receives licensing fees from its U.S. partner  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
BioNTech and Pfizer got the world's first approval for a COVID-19 vaccine at the end of 2020. ""The success of BioNTech is impressive,"" Dullien said. ""There is an excellent research landscape in Germany that has potential for the future.""
ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski also said Dullien's calculation was plausible, adding that BioNTech's success story was simply extraordinary.

""There aren't many companies that can go from zero to a hundred in just a year,"" Brzeski said.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 08:50AM ET</span>","Amid COVID, 2.5 million people sign up for U.S. health insurance -White House","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two and a half million people so far have bought health insurance through the online marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act after the Biden administration allowed more time to enroll amid COVID-19, the White House said on Tuesday. 
Individuals and small businesses have until Sunday to buy coverage via healthcare.gov, the portal created by the law popularly known as Obamacare, as part of President Joe Biden's efforts to grapple with the pandemic and shore up the 2010 law passed when he served under President Barack Obama. 
Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to announce the total enrollment during a visit to a community health center in Washington Tuesday morning.
""The Biden-Harris Administration continues to do everything we can to make high quality health care more affordable and accessible,"" the White House said in a statement. 
The special enrollment period was extended in part to help those who had lost their employer-related health insurance coverage as the pandemic rattled the U.S. economy. 
Separate legislation passed in March - the American Rescue Plan - also lowered the premiums people pay for plans obtained through the marketplace. Families on average have saved $40 per person per month under the law, according to the White House.
COVID-19 has killed more than 600,000 U.S. individuals, stressing healthcare systems amid several waves of the disease. Hospitalizations and deaths have risen in recent weeks amid the highly contagious Delta variant.

Biden, a Democrat, re-opened the enrollment period one week after taking office in January, citing ""damage"" done by his Republican predecessor Donald Trump, whose administration unsuccessfully sought to strike down the ACA.
United Health Group Inc, Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH) Inc, Anthem Inc and other insurers sell plans under the marketplace. Health care and employer groups earlier this year called for an expansion of the ACA to boost cost sharing and increase enrollments.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Marathon Asset Management's long-serving president and chief operating officer, Andrew Rabinowitz, is leaving the $22 billion hedge fund and his duties will be split among a trio of firm veterans, two people familiar with the matter said.
Rabinowitz, who spent nearly two decades helping grow Marathon into one of the world's biggest credit-oriented hedge funds, plans to leave next month to take a position outside of the investment management industry, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss personnel matters.
Jamie Raboy, Christine Chartouni and Jason Friedman will take on Rabinowitz' day-to-day responsibilities, ensuring a sense of continuity at the firm, which was founded in 1998 by Bruce Richards and Louis Hanover.
Marathon has given Raboy, currently its chief risk officer, the additional title of chief operating officer. Chartouni, Marathon's chief compliance officer, will also be the firm's chief legal officer. Friedman, head of corporate credit strategy, will take on the role of global head of business development, the sources said.
Rabinowitz, an attorney who previously specialized in hedge funds at law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel, joined Marathon in 2002. He will remain a member of Marathon's governance committee.
For years, he was a fixture on the hedge fund industry conference circuit and is known for founding the R Baby Foundation, which donates to hospitals to improve pediatric emergency care.
Marathon, whose assets have grown by roughly $10 billion in the last five years, sold a minority stake to Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) through the Strategic Capital Holdings fund in 2016. After the 2008 financial crisis, Marathon was selected by the U.S. Treasury Department as one of the managers of its Public Private Partnership program.

Seven brokerages rated the stock a ‘buy’ with UBS' Karl Keirstead’s ‘neutral’ rating being the exception. The analyst sees the stock at $20.
The price targets for the stock vary between UBS' $20 and Goldman Sachs $30, an upside of almost 54% from the stock’s close of $19.60 on Monday.

According to Wells Fargo's Michael Turrin who has a $24 target for the stock, Blend has not only landed ""some of the largest financial institutions in the world as customers,"" but also fostered a strong relationship with customers, which has helped drive fast growth and ""impressive"" net expansion rates.
He believes the road ahead for Blend is likely to prove increasingly lucrative with time.

TOKYO (Reuters) -SoftBank Group Corp will pause its investing in China as it waits for regulatory action against the country's tech firms to play out, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said on Tuesday. 
""Until the situation is clearer we want to wait and see,"" Son told a news conference. ""In a year or two I believe new rules will create a new situation.""
When the Japanese conglomerate posted record annual profit in May executives pointed to further upside from Vision Fund investments such as Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Global Inc and ""Uber for trucks"" startup Full Truck Alliance Co Ltd.
Those companies listed in New York but Chinese regulatory action has subsequently hammered valuations, underscoring SoftBank's China risk even as the group seeks to reduce dependence on its largest asset, a stake in Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. 
The shift has cast a chill on SoftBank's investing in China, which makes up about a quarter of its funds' portfolio. 
While the crackdown has affected returns expectations, ""our broader thesis in China is unchanged: It's still a large, growing and compelling economic opportunity,"" said Navneet Govil, the chief financial officer of Vision Fund.
The Vision Fund unit on Tuesday posted a first quarter profit of 236 billion yen ($2.14 billion) as gains from listings were offset by falling shares in firms like South Korean e-retailer Coupang Inc.
The China turmoil is clouding the outlook for the group, shares of which have slipped a third from two-decade highs in March amid the completion of a record 2.5 trillion yen buyback. Shares closed up 0.9% ahead of earnings. 
""Having a large public portfolio introduces volatility but at the same time it allows us to continue to monetise in a very disciplined manner,"" said Govil. 
Share price weakness and sell-side analyst speculation have driven expectation that a buyback may be imminent. 
""Until now we have sold assets and announced a buyback. This time there was no event like that,"" Son said. 
Given the gap between the group's share price and the value of its assets, he added, ""I guess we will do a buyback sometime. The timing and size is something we consider daily."" 
VISION FUND UPSIDE
More than two-thirds of the portfolio of the first $100 billion Vision Fund is listed or exited. SoftBank has distributed $27 billion to its limited partners since inception.
Further upside will come from listings by Indian payments firm Paytm and insurance aggregator Policybazaar as well as southeast Asian ridehailer Grab, which is due go public via a blank-cheque company merger, Govil said. 
SoftBank is also ramping up investing through Vision Fund 2, to which it has committed $40 billion of capital, with the unit making 47 new investments worth $14.2 billion in the April-June quarter alone.
Son said he would invest in the second fund through a scheme using his SoftBank shares as collateral. 
In its first quarter, Vision Fund unit gains included 310 billion yen from selling shares in investments such as delivery firm DoorDash Inc and ridehailer Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.
However, group net profit fell 39% to 762 billion yen. 
SoftBank has also been betting on publicly listed shares through its SB Northstar trading unit.
It held stakes in firms worth $13.6 billion at the end of June with the portfolio no longer including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) or  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) listed three months earlier. 

The unit will shrink as SoftBank prioritises the Vision Fund, Son said.

The suit, filed with the Supreme Court of the state of New York in April, targets Porsche SE as well as former members of the management and supervisory boards of Volkswagen, Porsche SE said in its half-year report.
Porsche SE, which holds 31.4% of Volkswagen, did not identify the plaintiffs and did not detail or quantify possible claims, saying the action had not yet been served.
""The plaintiffs claim to be shareholders of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and assert with their action alleged claims of Volkswagen AG on behalf of Volkswagen AG,"" Porsche SE said.
The lawsuit marks the latest chapter in the ""dieselgate"" saga since Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to using illegal software to rig diesel engine emissions tests. The scandal has cost the carmaker more than 32 billion euros ($38 billion) in fees, fines and legal costs so far.

Volkswagen and Porsche SE are already subject to 4.1 billion euros worth of shareholder claims in relation to the crisis, but it could take years before they are resolved.
Last month, Volkswagen shareholders approved a deal to settle claims against four former executives, including long-time CEO Martin Winterkorn, related to the crisis.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Tuesday, with investors awaiting more clues on Federal Reserve’s thinking as the earnings season continues.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 20 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures traded largely flat, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 25 points, or 0.2%.
Fed officials have started the debate over when and how they should taper the $120 billion monthly asset purchases, pledging not to start “until substantial further progress” has been made toward its goals of maximum employment and 2% inflation.
However, what qualifies “substantial” progress has not been defined, and thus market participants are studying speeches from the policymakers for clues over when this tapering will start.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is set to speak later Tuesday and Kansas City Fed President Esther George on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, the U.S. Senate is set later Tuesday to vote to pass one of the largest infrastructure investment bills in decades, providing an additional $1 billion stimulus to the market.
The second-quarter corporate earnings season is slowing down, but there are still a number of high-profile companies releasing results.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is likely to be in the spotlight after the troubled movie theater chain reported a lower loss than expected after the close Monday, also announcing it would begin accepting Bitcoin at all U.S. locations this year.

Also of interest, the Wall Street Journal reported that  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) is set to make a new offer for Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), valuing each Kansas share near $300, or about $27 billion, which would be an 11.3% premium to Monday’s closing price.
Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) will also be in the spotlight after it announced a tie-up with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that will allow its clients to run its applications on Google Cloud.
Oil prices bounced Tuesday after falling to three-week lows during the previous session ahead of the release of the latest U.S. crude supply data.

The German drugmaker, which has partnered with  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE), could see revenue contributing about half a percentage point to growth in German gross domestic product, according to Sebastian Dullien, a professor of International Economics at HTW Berlin.
Read more: BioNTech Lifts Covid Vaccine Sales Forecast to $18.7 Billion 
That’s because a large part of the Mainz, Germany-based company’s production is focused in Germany, he says. While some of its revenue might include inputs from abroad, the company’s profit-sharing agreement with Pfizer counts toward German GDP.
“This is quite extraordinary for a start-up,” Dullien said in a post on Twitter after the company released its quarterly report. “There are rare cases where single companies have a macroeconomic relevance.”
The Bundesbank predicts the German economy will expand 3.7% this year.
BioNTech’s largest plant in Marburg, Germany, has a manufacturing capacity of 1 billion doses per year. Some production steps are also done at a Pfizer factory in Belgium and by other manufacturing partners elsewhere in Europe, but Dullien argues this is unlikely to significantly diminish the impact on German GDP as production costs are low compared to revenues.
The Covid vaccine is on track to be one of the best-selling drugs of all time. BioNTech and Pfizer have signed contracts to deliver some 2.2 billion doses of the two-shot vaccine this year and more than 1 billion doses in 2022 and beyond. Pfizer said last month it may generate $33.5 billion in sales this year, which is split between the partners, and BioNTech also gets some revenue from direct sales.

Investing.com – Fisker (NYSE:FSR) soared 11% in Tuesday’s premarket following a strong bull case made out for the stock by a Morgan Stanley analyst a day earlier.
Analyst Adam Jonas resumed coverage on the electric vehicle maker with an ‘overweight’ and a target of $40, an upside of 166% from the stock’s Monday closing price of $15.03. The analyst also set a new $90 bull case for the stock.

Jonas believes Fisker’s tie-up with Magna-Steyr will help in contract manufacturing and accelerate time to market while providing a path to scale and profitability when the demand begins to exceed supply of EVs.
Fisker and Magna tied up in January to develop an Advanced Driver Assistance System for Ocean. In addition to leveraging cameras and ultrasonic sensors, the ADAS package includes a unique and first-to-market digital imaging radar technology.

The two companies have each surged more than 480% the past year to record highs.  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech’s partner on the shot, which has a fulsome list of other marketed drugs driving its valuation, has broken through a 21-year high as investors pile into vaccine-tied stocks.
“It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, because if you don’t own it, you are obviously underperforming,” Michael Yee, an analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said about Moderna in a video note. “Everyone has to buy it.” Moderna’s shares jumped 2.6% to $496.88 as of 6:10 a.m. in New York, putting them on pace to hit $200 billion in market value.
All three drugmakers have raised their sales forecasts on Covid shots over the past two weeks with Pfizer estimating revenue this year of $33.5 billion on three billion doses manufactured. With the delta variant spreading around the globe, U.S. virus expert Anthony Fauci has said the immuno-compromised should get additional shots, and investors are awaiting the Food and Drug Administration to lay out new guidance on who else could also be getting a third jab.
The companies secured the first emergency approvals for the virus and have been slowly building a case for the need for booster shots, though there has been some pushback. Pfizer plans to seek regulatory clearance for a third shot of its vaccine while Moderna still needs to determine its dosage before filing.
A handful of nations including Thailand and Israel have been giving out new doses to select groups of the already vaccinated, while the FDA has yet to weigh in on when such shots may be needed. The agency is expected to release its strategy for boosters as soon as September, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Salveen Richter on Friday boosted her price target to $461 from $299 for Moderna, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Gena Wang increased hers to a Wall Street high of $463 but the stock blew past those new targets in a Monday rally. Still, the sky high valuations on these stocks are facing unexpected resistance on Wall Street. Biotech analysts are notable for their usually rosy outlooks for the stocks in their coverage, but Moderna has more holds than buys and a price target that implies 43% downside.
For Yee and the bank’s strategist Will Sevush, tech and innovation funds have been driving the rally rather than hedge funds and investors that traditionally specialize in health-care stocks. Investment advisers currently make up the largest holder base in the stock with BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., the Vanguard Group Inc. and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) among Moderna’s top investors, according to Bloomberg data.
“They don’t trade fundamentally,” Sevush said “They’re in rare air.”
While Yee rates Moderna a hold with a price target of $425, below the current trading range, he expects booster shots to be available by 2022. The company is also expected to have flu vaccine results in late 2021.
“This story is not going to end,” Yee said.

404,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 06:22AM ET</span>",Who are you? African firms eye trade boost from global business card,"By Simon Jessop and Emma Rumney
LONDON (Reuters) - His company may have been operating for 61 years, but that counts for nothing when Second Muguyo, finance manager at Zimbabwean copper and silver goods manufacturer Copperwares, tries to access overseas credit.
The problem? Foreign lenders and trade partners don't know the company well enough. So when suppliers or customers demand cash payments or products up front, it locks in precious capital that can only be recouped when the finished goods are delivered - up to 10 months later.
The impact on the company's business has been to curtail its expansion, limit overseas sales and cap hiring of local workers - a problem mirrored by firms across the country, hampering its ability to recover from years of economic slump.
""Currently, we don't have any credit terms, even from our neighbouring countries,"" Muguyo told Reuters. ""We are funding our suppliers and customers left, right and centre, but we only receive it (payment) after 10 months."" 
Now, help may be coming in the form of an access pass to the world's financial system from a body set up by the G20 group of nations after the 2008 financial crisis, when regulators struggled to see who was exposed to stricken bank Lehman Brothers.
Largely confined so far to big corporates in the developed world, Legal Entity Identifier (LEIs) codes provide companies with a unique 20-character string of letters and numbers.
Copperwares is about to become one of the first mid-sized African companies to get one. 
Companies undergo a series of checks to prove who they are to hold one, lowering the risk for overseas counterparties and helping the company access cheaper, more flexible funding.
Currently, just 8,251 LEIs have been issued in African countries, many to local units of major developed market companies, out of more than 1.8 million active LEIs globally. 
Graphic: LEIs issued in African countries, https://graphics.reuters.com/AFRICA-COMPANIES/IDENTITY/dwvkrgnrbpm/chart.png 
They could be crucial to bolstering financial inclusion on the continent.
""This LEI initiative, once we're known out there, we expect life to be much easier; funding terms to be accessible, credit terms to be accessible,"" helping Copperwares produce more, employ more people, offer better prices and boost market share, said Muguyo. 
He said Copperwares estimated the market for its products in southern Africa was at least $15 million and had the potential to double in size, suggesting scope for the LEI to help the company boost revenues from just under $1 million currently.
Staff numbers could also grow from 65 to 120-130, he added. 
Set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board in 2014, the Swiss-based non-profit Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) oversees the LEI system, and has traditionally charged a fee for a company to register, something that has hampered take-up by smaller companies in Africa and elsewhere.
With the support of the German government, GLEIF is partnering with local banks to get them to conduct the due diligence checks necessary to get an LEI and ensure the company gets it for free.
By doing so, GLEIF said it hoped to help close the trade finance gap in Africa, which currently stands at more than $81 billion.
Between 2013 and 2014, less than 1% of African banks cited regulatory compliance as the main reason for rejecting trade finance applications, GLEIF said, while between 2015 and 2019 that figure had grown to around 16% as developed market banks demanded more information about their clients as part of efforts to fight fraud, money laundering and other financial crime.
""This is the first step toward greater financial inclusion and overcoming the challenges associated with access to trade finance in Africa,"" said GLEIF Chief Executive Stephan Wolf.

At Copperwares, local bank NMB Bank Ltd helped Muguyo get the company's LEI and hopes to roll out the initiative to many of its other small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) clients.
""The pipeline is huge,"" said Erasmus Bhunu, head of corporate and SME banking at NMB Bank. ""Most of our customers are willing to onboard,"" with more than 10 signed up so far across sectors including manufacturing and agriculture.

""In the incident, an unhealthy dynamic in a working environment, a disgusting drinking culture, a lack of transparency when reporting issues together exposed pervasive, deeply rooted unspoken rules,"" it said in a notice on its website. 
The piece calls on people to break ""unspoken rules"" such as coerced drinking.
On Sunday, a female Alibaba staffer alleged that she was sexually assaulted by her manager and a client while on a business trip.
The incident caused a storm on Chinese social media and a public backlash against Alibaba.

The staffer alleged that she was coerced into drinking while at a dinner meeting. She said that when she recounted the event to a high-level manager, he described drinking as necessary to do business.
On Monday, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang announced that the alleged perpetrator, along with several other Alibaba staff, had been fired. He also urged Alibaba employees to feel empowered to reject drinking alcohol.

Investing.com – Meme stock favorite GameStop (NYSE:GME) was up more than 2% in Tuesday’s premarket after movie chain operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said Monday he was looking to pursue some sort of partnership between the two companies.
""I cannot even count the number of times already that our shareholders have asked us to reach out and partner with GameStop. We're on the case. More to come."" Aron said Monday. He was addressing investors, analysts and the Reddit gang after the announcement of the company’s second-quarter earnings.
He added that AMC is ""certainly willing"" to partner GameStop, though no concrete details were announced.
AMC and GameStop are two of the best known 'meme stocks' - companies popular with retail investors congregating on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets that first gained widespread attention in January, when an unwind of bearish bets helped send GameStop’s shares up more than 1,600% that month.

Local sales of China-made vehicles plunged 69% to 8,621 cars from 28,138 in June. Tesla's sales in the first month of each quarter are usually lower than the following two months. 
The company, which makes Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles in Shanghai, sold 33,155 China-made vehicles in June.

Last month, Tesla introduced a cheaper version of the Model Y in China, where it faces increased scrutiny from both regulators and the public and growing competition from local rivals. It also lowered the starting price for Model 3 sedans.
China's BYD sold 50,387 electric vehicles last month, while General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s China joint venture with SAIC Motor delivered 27,347 units. CPCA also said China sold 1.52 million passenger cars in July, down 6.4% from a year earlier.

Investing.com -- Kansas City Southern stock (NYSE:KSU), at the heart of a bidding war between  Canadian Pacific  Railway (NYSE:CP) and  Canadian National Railway  (NYSE:CNI), was up 4.2% in Tuesday’s premarket on a report in The Wall Street Journal about a likely revised offer from Canadian Pacific.
According to the WSJ report, Canadian Pacific’s new offer values each Kansas share near $300, or about $27 billion. This will be an 11.3% premium to Kansas’ Monday closing of $269.60.
There is no guarantee of a new offer being made though, the report said.
As of now, a shareholder meeting is scheduled for August 19 to vote on the Canadian National-Kansas City Southern deal, so any offer from Canadian Pacific will have to be made before that date.
Canadian Pacific has urged Kansas City shareholders to vote against Canadian National’s offer.
The bidding for Kansas City started in April when Canadian Pacific first offered to buy the company, valuing it at $25 billion. Canadian National Railway made it a contest with its $33.7 billion offer that Kansas City accepted.
The bidding war comes as the U.S. economy booms while supply chains suffer because of COVID. There have been no major railroad mergers in the U.S. in the last two decades.

Investing.com – AMC stock (NYSE:AMC) was up almost 12% in Tuesday’s premarket a day after the multiplex operator posted a smaller than expected loss for the second quarter.
As of June 30, all of AMC's 593 U.S. movies theatres and 95% of its 335 international theatres were open, though most of them did not reopen until early June.
AMC's net losses narrowed to $344 million, or 71 cents per share, from a loss of $561.2 million, or $5.38 per share, a year ago. Analysts had forecast a loss of 91 cents per share.
The movie theater chain reported revenue of $444.7 million, higher than the $382.1 million analysts had expected.
New blockbusters, coming after a year of the pandemic, shored up revenue as audiences returned.
“AMC’s journey through this pandemic is not finished, and we are not yet out of the woods,” CEO Adam Aron said in a statement Monday. “However, while there are no guarantees as to what the future will bring in a still infection-impacted world, one can look ahead and envision a happy Hollywood ending to this story.”
 Aron also raised the possibility of accepting Bitcoin as a payment method at locations in U.S. in what is seen as an appeal to the interests of many of the company's new investors.
AMC avoided bankruptcy during the pandemic in part because it was able to raise cash on the back of the “meme stock” frenzy.

The fast-spreading Delta coronavirus variant and the subsequent tightening of curbs in some places have compounded worries for office space providers, as businesses opt for shorter leases and many employees continue to work remotely.
Reiterating that it still expects a strong recovery in 2022, the FTSE 250 firm said the pace of the rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic was coming through slower than originally anticipated.
""We look forward to the second half with cautious optimism having implemented the necessary changes to our network and cost base,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Dixon said in a statement.
Switzerland-headquartered IWG, which has more than 3,300 locations across 110 countries, said half-year open centre revenue fell 14.6% to 1.06 billion pounds ($1.47 billion), while occupancy declined 6.9 percentage points to 68.4%.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - From wellness workshops to dinner with a celebrity chef and flights to nowhere, Asia's big international airlines are working hard to keep their most lucrative customers engaged as the pandemic-related travel halt stretches beyond 18 months.
While flights are starting to rebound in the United States and Europe, international travel is still down 96% in Asia due to tough travel restrictions, making it harder to maintain a relationship with grounded premium clients.
Elite frequent flyers, many of them business travellers, are coveted by full-service carriers like Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd, Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd, and the airlines want them back when travel resumes.
Before the pandemic, around 5% of international passengers globally flew in premium classes, but they accounted for 30% of international revenue, data from airline industry group IATA shows.
Asian airlines have given status extensions of at least two years to elite tier customers who have earned access to airport lounges and other perks such as priority access to seats and upgrades to higher flight classes.
Qantas Loyalty CEO Olivia Wirth said customers had made clear to the airline that such extensions were important.
""They work in many cases for years to achieve these high statuses and high tiers, so it was really important for us that we were going to continue to be loyal to them just as they had been loyal to us in the years gone by,"" she said.
For airlines, the extensions come at relatively little cost given the potential future reward. 
Grounded elite members are not accessing airport lounges stocked with fine wines, made-to-order meals and day spas, although Qantas did host a dinner in Sydney for a few of them with celebrity chef Neil Perry and CEO Alan Joyce in June.
Singapore Airlines, which lacks a domestic market, said it has hosted virtual wine tastings, wellness workshops and online courses such as miniature clay art and coffee-brewing and offered a first class dine-at-home experience. 
Some other engagement initiatives are paid for by the flyer. Michael Dean, a Qantas Platinum One flyer, said his status enabled him to secure his preferred business class seats on a 747 joyflight from Brisbane last year - for A$747 ($550) a seat - just before Qantas retired the jumbo jet. 
""It was not cheap, but great fun,"" he said.
HEY BIG SPENDER
With flights grounded, airlines globally have also boosted engagement with another lucrative group - customers who fly less often but spend large amounts on co-branded credit cards that earn users air miles they can redeem for flights.
Airlines earn money from such cards by selling the frequent flyer miles to credit card issuers to use as rewards for cardholders.
Consumers have kept spending on co-branded cards at a similar rate to the broader credit card market during the pandemic, Qantas data and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) data on its co-branded Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) cards shows. 
Evert de Boer, Singapore-based managing partner at consultancy On Point Loyalty said there were industry concerns earlier in the pandemic that consumers would switch from airline co-branded cards to cards that offer cash-back or other incentives, due to the halt in travel. 
""But that hasn't happened at all,"" he said. ""You can actually see that people want to travel.""
During the pandemic, Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific have developed their loyalty programmes into broader lifestyle brands, adding more miles-earning opportunities through e-commerce, dining and hotel stays, as Qantas has long done.
These highly engaged members could become increasingly important to airlines amid industry forecasts that business travel will take a long-term hit from video-conferencing and environmental concerns.
Fiona Downes, a Qantas Platinum One flyer, said it could take two to three years after borders reopened for her work travel to return to pre-COVID levels. Her points balance has grown through credit card spending, but she is also hoping the airline will allow her to retain elite status.

""I certainly would like to know that when I do start flying again - even at a small scale, but as things are starting to ramp up - that I am not disadvantaged in any way or I am not starting from scratch again,"" she said.

Established players like Delivery Hero face intense competition from a crop of newer, well-funded startups running networks of 'dark stores' that can dispatch groceries ordered on a smartphone app to the doorstep within minutes.
Analysts predict a shakeout once the pace of growth slows and Delivery Hero, a constituent of Germany's DAX blue-chip share index, has built equity stakes in a number of its peers in a move that could herald industry consolidation.

Investing.com – Krafton Inc. made a subpar debut on the Korean Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The company’s listing was the first in South Korea where shares failed to rise above the IPO price in a debut since 2020’s uptick in listings.
Krafton shares tumbled 12.75% to KRW434,500 ($378.96) by 1:14 AM ET (5:14 AM GMT), after falling as much as 20% earlier in the session.
An expensive valuation and Chinese regulatory risks contributed to a disappointing debut for the company, which is backed by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. (HK:0700) and behind the blockbuster PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) video game.
Krafton said 87% of its first-quarter revenue for 2021 was from Asia ex-South Korea, with a large portion of the 87% likely from sales in China handled by Tencent. The Chinese company saw its shares tumble during the previous week after the Xinhua Agency-affiliated Economic Information Daily labeled online gaming ""spiritual opium”.
However, Krafton still managed to raise $3.75 billion through what is currently South Korea's second-largest IPO ever. The placing comes even after regulatory orders forced the company to slash the fundraising target by more than KRW 1 trillion.
Paul Choi, head of Korea Research at CLSA, remained bullish on the company’s long-term potential despite its rocky debut.
""Unlike other internet and gaming companies that are mostly domestic-focused, 95% of Krafton's revenue is generated outside South Korea... so this is a rare, truly global new economy firm.,"" he told Bloomberg."

The United Nations' Climate Change Conference (COP26) is due to take place in Scotland in November, aiming to wring much more ambitious climate action from nations.
""Governments have not nailed this problem,"" Winters said at an online industry event.
He added that while he was optimistic going into COP26, ""we have to prepare for the eventuality either there isn't agreement or there is agreement but the enforcement mechanisms are weak.""
His comments come on the heels of a U.N. science report which has warned that global warming is dangerously close to spiralling out of control.
Winters is chair of a private-sector initiative called the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, which aims to set standards and encourage the developments of carbon trading schemes outside those managed by governments like the EU. 

He said such schemes would help projects that can reduce carbon emissions to get funding, and also influence companies to make more environmentally sustainable decisions by putting a price on carbon.
StanChart has said it aims to reach net zero carbon emissions from its operations by 2030 and have the companies it finances reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In remarks to the USW national oil bargaining policy conference, Conway said decarbonization projects should be viewed as necessary capital investment programs.
“Here sits the capital investment program that we need to keep our refineries up and running and keep the pressure off of them from the communities that would otherwise shut them down,” Conway said. 
Officials from local unions representing 30,000 refinery and chemical plant workers are meeting online this week to develop proposals to be used in talks in January with Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), which is representing the nation’s oil companies for the first time. 

Marathon, the nation’s largest refiner, was chosen to replace Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Co, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell, which was the lead negotiator for the oil companies from the late 1990s through 2019. Shell has reduced the number of the refineries it operates in the United States and by the end of this year will operate only one plant.
The 2022 contract talks will come after national refining capacity fell 4.5% in the COVID-19 pandemic.

(Reuters) -Cinema operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) beat second-quarter revenue estimates on Monday, lifted by the return of moviegoers to its theaters after a year of closures and restrictions, sending its shares up 4% in extended trading.
""F9: The Fast Saga"" - the latest installment of the ""Fast and Furious"" series - and ""Godzilla vs Kong"" gave AMC much-needed relief from the blows it has taken from the pandemic over the past year.
Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said U.S. ticket revenue in the third quarter was on track to reach 45% of the same quarter in 2019.
""That trend line is pointing up. We certainly have a way to go but the progress is clear,"" Aron said on a post-earnings call.
The company also announced a deal with Warner Brothers for an exclusive theatrical window of 45 days prior to home release for all Warner Brother films in 2022.
""The decision to go back to 45 days is great,"" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter.
He added that AMC will have the technology in place to receive payment for movie tickets and concessions in bitcoin by the end of the year.
Responding to pre-submitted questions from individual investors, Aron entertained selling merchandise from theaters, and he said AMC would discuss potential partnerships with GameStop (NYSE:GME).
Revenue at the company, one of the ""meme stocks"" at the center of a boom in small-time investing this year, rose 19% to $444.7 million in the quarter ended June 30. Analysts on average had expected $382.1 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
AMC raised another $1.25 billion of new equity capital in the quarter, taking AMC's quarter-ending liquidity to more than $2 billion.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Italy's antitrust authority AGCM will investigate McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) terms and conditions in its agreements with franchise operators following several complaints, according to an AGCM document seen by Reuters.
The AGCM move could put the U.S. fast-food chain at risk of a fine of as much as 10% of its global turnover if it is found guilty of breaching Italian antitrust rules. 
The AGCM declined to comment. McDonald's Italy said it was ""certain of the correctness of our work"" and open to collaborating with the agency. The group made $19.2 billion in revenues in 2020.
The Italian competition watchdog said that based on the available information there appeared to be a relationship of economic dependence between the store operators and McDonald's.
Some of McDonald's clauses in the franchising agreements cited by the complainants could constitute an abuse of economic dependence, it said in its decision to open an investigation, according to the 13-page document dated Aug. 4.
The watchdog said a series of pervasive and binding clauses on prices, promotions, stocks, supplies and purchases, financial management, among others, could be seen as elements of abusive conduct. 
Antitrust laws prohibit companies from abusing the economic dependence of another company via unjustifiably burdensome or discriminatory contractual conditions, especially when the latter cannot find a viable alternative.
With 85% of its outlets operated by franchisees, franchising is an important business model for McDonald's. It has about 615 restaurants in Italy, 85% of which are not company owned.
McDonald's Italy said: ""While we do not yet know details of the investigation launched by the Italian Competition Authority, we are open to collaborating with the Authority, and we are certain of the correctness of our work and of the role that McDonald's has had and continues to have in stimulating entrepreneurship and in supporting the country's economy.""
McDonald's has 60 days to respond once it is notified and the investigation must be wrapped up by Dec. 31, 2022, the document said.

McDonald's found itself on the AGCM's radar after three operators filed complaints in March regarding rents, royalties, the size of their investments and sales policies, according to the document.
Italian consumer groups Codacons, Movimento Difesa del Cittadino and Cittadinanzattiva in 2017 took their grievances to the AGCM.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 dipped on Monday, as fuel demand worries during a resurgent pandemic sent energy stocks lower but rising U.S. Treasury yields lifted financial stocks, keeping Wall Street's benchmark index near record levels.
Energy shares were the worst performing of the 11 major S&P sectors, down 1.48% along with crude prices as mounting coronavirus cases and the potential for restrictions, particularly in China, raised worries about the fuel demand outlook.
China reported more COVID-19 infections, while U.S. cases and hospitalizations were at a six-month high as the Delta variant spread.
Financial shares gained, buoyed by a climb in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield back above 1.30% to its highest level since July 16 as a report on job openings showed further evidence of an improving labor market.
""In general, of the economically sensitive cyclicals, it is the interest-rate sensitives that are going to celebrate this normalization of yields, even if normal is 1.30% versus where we were a week ago, which was 1.12%. That is driving the action,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. 
Investors will watch U.S. inflation readings this week for hints about the path of Federal Reserve policy. On Monday, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said the United States should be well past the pandemic crisis before the central bank raises rates. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said high inflation this year may have already met one of the Fed's benchmarks for raising interest rates.
Later this month, a meeting of Fed leaders in Jackson Hole, Wyoming should provide insight into the central bank's potential plan to begin tapering its bond purchases.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 106.66 points, or 0.3%, to 35,101.85, the S&P 500 lost 4.17 points, or 0.09%, to 4,432.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.42 points, or 0.16%, to 14,860.18.
A strong earnings season has helped U.S. stocks climb to record highs over the past two weeks, as several consensus-beating results from major firms reinforced belief in a post-COVID economic recovery.
As of Friday, analysts expected second-quarter profit growth of 93.1% for S&P 500 companies, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Of the 443 companies in the index that have reported earnings so far, 87.4% beat analyst expectations, the highest on record.
 Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) Inc climbed 7.41% after it agreed to be bought for $4.53 billion by commodities trader Cargill Inc and investment firm Continental Grain Co at a time when meat prices have been soaring.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) advanced 8.69% after the meat processing company raised its forecast for fiscal 2021 revenue.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.63-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 66 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.55 billion shares, compared with the 9.64 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Reuters reported in June that Nubank had invited investment banks to pitch for roles in the upcoming IPO, which could value the company at more than $40 billion.
At that valuation, Nubank's IPO would be one of the biggest- ever stock market debuts of a South American company, putting it on par with other high-profile offerings such as that of online brokerage  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD), which went public in July. 
Nubank is expected to file for the IPO by the end of this year or early 2022, sources have told Reuters. 
Nubank, whose legal name is Nu Pagamentos, declined to comment on the matter. Morgan Stanley, Citi and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 

In June, Nubank raised $750 million in a funding round led by  Berkshire Hathaway Inc , valuing it at $30 billion.

Major U.S. companies are changing policies on vaccinations and masking as the Delta variant of the coronavirus drives a resurgence of cases.
Tyson said last Tuesday that office workers must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 1, while plant workers have until Nov. 1, subject to discussions with labor unions. At the time, about 56,000 employees had already been vaccinated, roughly 47% of Tyson's U.S. workforce of 120,000, according to the company.
Employees had a ""somewhat mixed"" reaction to the mandate, Chief Executive Donnie King told reporters on Monday after the company reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings. Some workers got shots who previously ""weren't really excited about the vaccination,"" he said.
King did not know of employees who quit over the mandate but said there could be ""some short-term impacts.""
""We don't want to lose anyone,"" he said. 

Tyson came under fire last year as plant workers became infected and died from COVID-19. The company temporarily closed plants to contain outbreaks, tightening U.S. meat supplies.
The recent spread of the Delta variant has made it harder for Tyson to find workers, King said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed flat Monday, as investors weighed up a slip in energy against gains in financials just as the infrastructure bill is nearing passage through Congress.
The S&P 500 closed flat to remain close to its all-time high of 4,436.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3%, or 106 points, and the Nasdaq was up 0.2%
Energy stocks fell more than 1% as oil prices deepened their losses following a slump last week as surging Covid-19 cases continued to muddy the outlook for energy demand.
“The [oil] price slide [from late Friday] is continuing today amid growing concerns about demand again [amid] rising coronavirus figures in Asia,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note. “[T]his could prompt the Chinese government to take drastic measures in line with its strict zero Covid strategy.""
The U.S. reported a seven-day average of more than 108,600 new cases per day as of Sunday, up 36% from a week earlier, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Despite concerns over the delta-variant led surge in cases, the overall sentiment on the economy remains positive following last week’s better-than-expected jobs report.
“While some fear an impact from the Delta variant going forward, at least for now, businesses do not appear to be deterred from continuing to add employees and at least attempt to return to ‘normal,"" Stifel said in a note.
Treasury yields continued to rack up gains, with the 10-year continuing to trend above 1.3%. Wall Street is expecting more gains ahead for Treasury yields, “10y UST yields double-bottomed at 1.125% and will rise into year-end, led by US real rates decoupling from those in Europe,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. “Strong US data, back-to-school success, ‘advanced notice’ on Fed tapering, and progress on infrastructure make the US stand out.""
The backdrop of rising yields continued to support banking stocks and the broader financial sector.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) were up more than 1%. Higher interest rates boost the return on interest that banks earn from their loan products, or net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
As well as rising banking stocks, a gain in  Berkshire Hathaway  B (NYSE:BRKb) also supported financials after the conglomerate’s reported a 21.3% year-on-year climb in its second quarter operating income.
“Results were boosted in part by record profits at its railroad subsidiary BNSF Railway. Buybacks totaled about $6 billion and cash holdings stand at $144 billion at quarter end,” DA Davidson said.
Megacap tech stocks also kept gains in the broader market in check. Apart Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were in the red.
In other news,  Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) nearly 9% supported by a rally in bitcoin ahead of cryptocurrency exchange’s quarterly results due Tuesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global share prices treaded water on Monday as sharp falls in gold and oil prices and concerns over the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant dented sentiment.
U.S. stock indexes were mixed at the close.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 106.66 points, or 0.3%, to 35,101.85, the S&P 500 lost 4.17 points, or 0.09%, to 4,432.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.42 points, or 0.16%, to 14,860.18.
""With the Delta variant spreading, money managers who were over-invested in the re-opening trade continue to unwind that trade because it's not working right now,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC. 
In Europe, gains in healthcare, utilities and technology stocks outweighed declines triggered by a fall in commodity prices earlier on Monday.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.2% to a closing high of 470.68. 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.03%.
Oil prices fell as much as 4%, extending last week's steep losses on a rising U.S. dollar and concerns that new coronavirus-related restrictions in Asia, especially China, could slow a global recovery in fuel demand.
U.S. crude oil futures settled at $66.48 per barrel, down $1.80 or 2.6%. Brent crude ended at $69.04, down $1.66 or 2.4%.
""The sell-off in commodities is driving growth concerns as some investors are turning cautious,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
Gold slumped to a more than four-month low as strong U.S. jobs data bolstered expectations for an early tapering of the Federal Reserve's economic support measures. 
Spot gold dropped 1.9% to $1,729.09 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 2.1% down at $1,726.50.
Bitcoin hit a three-month high and broke through the $46,000 barrier as gold fell.
""Money managers are seeing that as an alternative to gold,"" said Dick.
Bitcoin last rose 5.46% to $46,253.56.
The strong jobs data also caused U.S. Treasury yields to rise. 
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 11/32 in price to yield 1.3254%, from 1.288% late on Friday.
Holidays in Tokyo and Singapore made for thin trading conditions, adding to the volatility. After an initial fall, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan recovered to be up 0.1%.
Chinese trade data over the weekend undershot forecasts, while figures out on Monday showed inflation slowed to 1% in July, offering no barrier to more policy stimulus.
The U.S. Senate came closer to passing a $1 trillion infrastructure package, though it still has to go through the House.
Investors were still assessing whether Friday's strong U.S. payrolls report would take the Federal Reserve a step nearer to winding back its stimulus.
""What we're seeing is a little bit of early profit-taking on the back of fear that tapering will come in earlier in September,"" said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management. ""But as you can see, it has little impact because the effect of a better economy far outweighs the substitution effect of higher interest rates."" 
LONGER TAPER 
However, the pace of tapering was still up in the air and would decide when an actual rate increase comes, he said. The Fed is buying $120 billion of assets a month, so a $20 billion taper would end the program in six months, while a $10 billion tapering approach would take a year.
The spread of the Delta variant could argue for a longer taper, with U.S. cases back to levels seen in last winter's surge with more than 66,000 people hospitalized.
Data for July CPI due this week is expected to confirm inflation has peaked, with prices for second-hand vehicles finally easing after huge gains.
Four Fed officials are speaking this week and will no doubt offer enough grist for markets looking for clues on the timing of tapering.
In the meantime, stocks have been mostly underpinned by a robust U.S. earnings season. BofA analysts noted S&P 500 companies were tracking a 15% beat on second-quarter earnings with 90% having reported. 
""However, companies with earnings beats have seen muted reactions on their stock price the day following earnings releases, and misses have been penalized,"" they wrote in a note.

And because semiconductors are the backbone of a plethora of tech products, we think multi-billion-dollar investments in this space should drive the performances of semiconductor companies Lam Research (LRCX), KLA (KLAC), and STMicroelectronics (STM) in the coming months. Let’s discuss.Since last year, the tech industry has been in the limelight, given accelerated demand for advanced tech productions and solutions amid remote working trends and rapid digital transformation. In this environment, companies are investing significantly in developing breakthrough technologies to stay ahead of the competition.
In 2023, $30 billion in revenue is expected to be generated by products and services that did not exist prior to the pandemic, according to  Gartner  (NYSE:IT). The research and advisory company also projects the worldwide IT spending will total $4.2 trillion in 2021, increasing 8.6% year-over-year. Furthermore, governments are investing substantially to overcome a current shortage in semiconductor production, which is expected to accelerate tech innovation in the long run.
Given this backdrop, we believe tech companies Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), KLA Corporation (KLAC), and STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM) are well-positioned to deliver significant returns in the upcoming months.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped Monday, weighed down by a slide in energy, but the index remained near record highs following the stronger monthly jobs report Friday.
The S&P 500 was flat, and remained close to its all-time high of 4,440.82. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2%, or 81 points, and the Nasdaq was up 0.3%
Energy stocks fell 1% as oil prices deepened their losses following a slump last week as surging Covid-19 cases continued to muddy the outlook for energy demand.
“The [oil] price slide [from late Friday] is continuing today amid growing concerns about demand again [amid] rising coronavirus figures in Asia,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note. “[T]his could prompt the Chinese government to take drastic measures in line with its strict zero Covid strategy.""
The U.S. reported a seven-day average of more than 108,600 new cases per day as of Sunday, up 36% from a week earlier, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Despite concerns over the delta-variant led surge in cases, the overall sentiment on the economy remains positive following last week’s better-than-expected jobs report.
“While some fear an impact from the Delta variant going forward, at least for now, businesses do not appear to be deterred from continuing to add employees and at least attempt to return to ‘normal,"" Stifel said in a note.
Treasury yields continued to rack up gains, with the 10-year continuing to trend above 1.3%. Wall Street is expecting more gains ahead for Treasury yields, “10y UST yields double-bottomed at 1.125% and will rise into year-end, led by US real rates decoupling from those in Europe,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. “Strong US data, back-to-school success, ‘advanced notice’ on Fed tapering, and progress on infrastructure make the US stand out.
”The backdrop of rising yields continued to support banking stocks and the broader financial sector.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) were up more than 1%. Higher interest rates boost the return on interest that banks earn from their loan products, or net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
As well as rising banking stocks, a gain in  Berkshire Hathaway  B (NYSE:BRKb) also supported financials after the conglomerate’s reported a 21.3% year-on-year climb in its second quarter operating income.
“Results were boosted in part by record profits at its railroad subsidiary BNSF Railway. Buybacks totaled about $6 billion and cash holdings stand at $144 billion at quarter end,” DA Davidson said.
Megacap tech stocks also kept gains in the broader market in check. Apart Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were in the red.
In other news,  Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) jumped 8% supported by a rally in bitcoin ahead of cryptocurrency exchange’s quarterly results due Tuesday."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 28 U.S. House Democrats on Monday asked congressional leaders to back $85 billion in funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, a big jump over funding proposed in a bill before Congress.
The current $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill under consideration has $7.5 billion in EV charging infrastructure funding, but Democrats plan to add additional funding in a separate measure that could spend up to $3.5 trillion.
The lawmakers, led by Representatives Debbie Dingell and Yvette Clarke, said in a letter that higher funding will ""help add utility electrical capacity to enable robust charging, increasing the supply of renewable energy, and build grid resilience in the face of climate change."" 
President Joe Biden in March called for $174 billion in total spending on electric vehicles, including $100 billion in consumer incentives and $15 billion to build 500,000 EV charging stations. 
The lawmakers, including House Transportation Chairman Peter DeFazio, said ""a rapid and extensive build-out of electric vehicle charging infrastructure supported by the federal government is crucial if consumers are to adopt zero emission vehicles at the scale and pace needed to stave off climate catastrophe.""
The letter said Congress must ensure charging for ""disadvantaged communities, including on-street and public parking, multi-unit dwellings, public and affordable housing, public parks, public buildings, places of work, (and) commuter transit hubs.""
In a broad outline of the $3.5 trillion proposal released Monday, Senate Democrats plan funding to electrify the federal vehicle fleet including U.S. Postal Service vehicles and make other investments in clean vehicles as well as provide other clean energy and transportation tax incentives.

On Thursday, Biden signed an executive order setting a target of making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric, a move made with backing from the biggest U.S. automakers.
The 50% target won the support of U.S. and foreign automakers, which said that achieving it would require billions of dollars in government funding.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most Wall Street workers can expect double-digit increases in bonuses this year compared to 2020, while investment bankers could see the biggest checks in roughly a decade, according to a report by compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc.
Last year, Wall Street bonuses were flat-to-down due to the economic hit from COVID-19 lockdowns, but this year's bounce back shows that financial executives feel their businesses have recovered since the pandemic wiped $21 trillion off the markets between February and March last year, Johnson said.
""The industry has performed at a level that last year we thought was impossible,"" said Alan Johnson, whose report is closely watched by financial professionals. 
Investment bankers will take home the biggest bonus checks in around a decade, thanks to an unprecedented surge in deal making this year, he estimates. Bankers who do underwriting work could enjoy a 30-35% increase in their 2021 bonus, while bankers who handle advisory work and equity sales and trading professionals could get 20-25% increases, he estimates. 
Asset managers, hedge fund and private equity workers could see increases of 10-15%, while fixed income traders, retail and commercial bankers should expect bonuses to be flat, Johnson said. 
The analysis is based on second quarter results from 10 asset management firms and eight major investment and commercial banks. Banks will communicate and begin paying out bonuses to staff from January next year.
In recent months, big banks have stepped up pay for investment bankers, particularly first and second year workers, to compensate them for a workload that is grueling even by industry standards.

While money is nice, it may not be enough to make staff happy, said Johnson.
""It's not really all about the money,"" he said. ""They feel overworked with no end in sight.""

We think  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) and Bill.com (BILL) shares look significantly overvalued at their current prices and are due for a retreat. As such, it could be wise to avoid these names for now. Read on.The resurgence of the COVID-19 cases due to the rapid spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant has been fueling market volatility. Also contributing to investor nervousness is that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as early 2023, but the timing regarding its tapering activities is still uncertain.
The prolonged period of loose monetary policy, in part, has led to stretched valuations for several fundamentally weak stocks. The stock market got a further boost from solid second-quarter earnings reports. However, along with the possible negative impact on the economic recovery of rising COVID-19 cases, concerns over high inflation have been fostering market volatility. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that inflation could be persistent. As a result, several investors predict a market correction in the near term.
Against this backdrop, we think fundamentally weak stocks Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) and Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) look significantly overvalued at their current price levels and are due for a pullback. So, it’s best to avoid these two stocks now.

Investing.com –  Roku  stock (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock rose 2.2% Monday after the company said 23 original shows will premiere on its channel four days from now.
The lineup features four all-new premieres, available exclusively on The Roku Channel. The latest addition is in line with the platform’s strategy of building ad-supported content.
Much of the content is from the now-defunct streaming service Quibi. Roku, which also sells streaming players and its own smart TV, had acquired that content in January including more than 75 shows. It debuted 30 of them in May.
Never-before-seen series like ""Eye Candy,"" ""Squeaky Clean,"" season two of ""Thanks a Million,"" and ""What Happens in Hollywood,"" will form part of the Friday launch. Multi-Emmy nominated ""Mapleworth Murders"" will also make its debut on The Roku Channel.
Roku has been trying to establish an ad-supported video-on-demand service. It licenses content from other media companies and monetizes it by streaming ads along with programming.
The company last week reported its second-quarter results. Even as Roku grew its active accounts by 1.5 million to close the quarter with 55.1 million, the platform had to take a hit on the number of hours users streamed programming.
After a year of the pandemic when most stayed home and binge watched, online consumption came off with malls and theatres opening and people choosing to step outside.
Users streamed 17.4 billion hours in the second quarter compared to 18.3 billion in the March quarter.
Average revenue per user rose on both sequential and year-on-year basis. It was $36.46, up 46% year-on-year.
Total net revenue grew 81% year-over-year to $645 million as the company was able to monetize more than double last time’s video ad impressions and more media companies used its tools to grow their direct-to-consumer services. Revenue topped the analysts’ expectation of $618.82 million.
Adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents was higher than the estimated 12 cents.
Roku expects third-quarter total net revenue of $680 million and adjusted earnings at $65 million at their respective midpoints.

Investing.com –  American National Insurance  stock (NASDAQ:ANAT) rose more than 8% on Monday after Brookfield Asset Management Reinsurance Partners (TSX:BAMR) said it would acquire the provider of life insurance and pension products in an approximately $5.1 billion.
American National stockholders will get $190 in cash for each share, a 1.6% premium to the stock’s current price of $187. The merger is expected to close in the first half of 2022.
Brookfield Reinsurance will fund the deal through committed debt financing of $1.5 billion and equity up to the aggregate merger consideration from Brookfield Asset Management. Equity commitment will be reduced by the amount of debt funded at closing. BAM’s equity commitment will be funded by existing liquidity at the corporate level.
The potential deal comes amid heightened activity in the U.S. insurance market. U.S. insurers are stepping up sales of annuities and other capital-intensive assets amid a surge in interest from new and established private equity buyers hungry to boost the quantum of funds under their management.
Last month, AIG (NYSE:AIG) signed a broad-based deal with Blackstone (NYSE:BX) that included sale of a 9.9% stake for $2.2 billion in its life and retirement business to the private equity giant.

In a preliminary ruling issued on Sunday, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in Miami said Norwegian would likely prevail on its argument that the ""vaccine passport"" ban jeopardizes public health and unconstitutionally infringes on Norwegian's rights.
The law went into effect on July 1 and essentially codified an executive order that DeSantis signed in April.
""We disagree with the judge’s legal reasoning and will be appealing to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals,"" said a statement from the governor's office. ""A prohibition on vaccine passports does not even implicate, let alone violate, anyone’s speech rights, and it furthers the substantial, local interest of preventing discrimination among customers based on private health information.""
Norwegian has said Florida's law would prevent the company from ensuring at least 95% of passengers were vaccinated so it could comply with health regulations when it conducts its voyage from Miami on Aug. 15.
DeSantis has become a national figure for opposing pandemic restrictions, even as the Republican governor's state has become a hotbed of infections https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-covid-19-cases-hit-six-month-high-over-100000-reuters-tally-2021-08-05 and hospitalizations have hit record levels.

The judge said Florida failed to demonstrate that the law was implemented in response to real problems facing Florida residents. She also found the law improperly burdened Norwegian's right to freely communicate with its passengers.
The ruling comes as big business and some government entities are responding to the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus with vaccination requirements, prompting legal challenges from vaccine skeptics and civil libertarians.

(Reuters) -A U.S. judge has allowed Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd. to demand that passengers show written proof of coronavirus vaccination before they board a ship, dealing a major blow to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's effort to ban ""vaccine passports.""
In a preliminary ruling issued on Sunday, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in Miami said Norwegian would likely prevail on its argument that the ""vaccine passport"" ban, signed into law by DeSantis in May, jeopardizes public health and is an unconstitutional infringement on Norwegian's rights.
The judge blocked DeSantis from enforcing the law against Norwegian, allowing the cruise ship operator to proceed with a plan to resume port activity in Miami on Aug. 15. Violations of the law could have triggered a penalty of $5,000 per passenger, potentially adding up to millions of dollars per cruise.
Raymond Treadwill, a lawyer for DeSantis, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The ruling comes as big business and some government entities are responding to the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus with vaccination requirements, prompting legal challenges from vaccine skeptics and civil libertarians.
""We are pleased that Judge Williams saw the facts, the law and the science as we did and granted the Company's motion for preliminary injunction allowing us to operate cruises from Florida with 100% vaccinated guests and crew,"" the company's executive vice president Daniel S. Farkas said in the statement.
Norwegian has said Florida's law would prevent the company from ensuring at least 95% of passengers were vaccinated so it could comply with health regulations when it conducts its first post-pandemic voyage from Miami on Aug. 15.
DeSantis has become a national figure for opposing pandemic restrictions, even as the Republican governor's state has become a hotbed of infections and hospitalizations have hit record levels. 
He has argued that Florida law prevents discrimination and protects privacy by preventing businesses, schools or governments from demanding proof of immunity in return for service.
Norwegian has said the law was not about protecting passengers but scoring political points.
Norwegian is ramping up its return to cruises, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shut down in March 2020 with its ""No Sail"" order.
In order to sail, Norwegian has attested to the CDC it would confirm that at least 95% of passengers have been vaccinated.

Norwegian said the law violates the company's First Amendment right to interact with customers and does not prevent discrimination because the company would have to segregate and mask passengers who declined to prove they were vaccinated.
The state argued that Norwegian could have opted, as rival cruise operators did, to seek CDC approval through a process of running simulated voyages and applying other COVID-19 protocols such as masking indoors.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -BioNTech said that repeat shots of its COVID-19 vaccine, of which more than a billion doses have now been supplied worldwide, was a better strategy than tailoring the product it developed with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) to new variants.
The German biotech firm said that offering a third dose of its established two-shot vaccine remained the best response to concerns over waning immune protection in the face of the highly contagious Delta variant, as worse strains may emerge.
BioNTech said the more than one billion supply tally as per July 21 was up from 700 million-plus doses it announced in June.
This compares with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) saying last month that it and manufacturing partner Serum Institute of India had supplied a billion doses of its vaccine globally.
Based on delivery contracts signed for more than 2.2 billion doses so far, BioNTech said in a statement detailing its second quarter earnings that it expects to accrue 15.9 billion euros ($18.7 billion) in revenue from the vaccine this year, up from a May forecast of 12.4 billion euros.
That includes sales, milestone payments and a share of gross profit in its partners' territories, BioNTech added.
Pfizer late last month raised its forecast for its share of 2021 vaccine sales to $33.5 billion and said at the time it believes people will need a third dose of the shot.
Pfizer and BioNTech's decision in early July to seek authorization for a third dose drew criticism from U.S. health regulators, who said there was not yet enough data to show booster shots are needed. 
U.S. health agencies have since discussed additional doses for people with compromised immune systems, while Germany and France said they would roll out a third dose for the most vulnerable from September.
That jars with a call by the World Health Organization to use doses instead to jump-start vaccination campaigns in poorer nations which have so far been left behind.
BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said that although work was ongoing to adjust the vaccine to variants it was not clear whether yet another version of the pathogen would supplant the now prevalent Delta variant.
""Making a decision at the moment might turn out to be wrong in three or six months if another variant is dominating,"" Sahin said during an analyst call.
Chief Medical Officer Oezlem Tuereci said lab experiments had shown that a third shot of the established product generated neutralising antibodies against a range of strains and that the antibody boost was above the one following a second dose.

Still, the company reiterated plans to start testing a vaccine adjusted to the Delta variant on humans this month, part of a ""comprehensive strategy to address variants"".

(Reuters) -Investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group Inc has markedly boosted salaries for its bankers, a source close to the matter said on Monday, mirroring recent pay hikes by other Wall Street lenders.
The bank's first-year U.S. analysts will now earn $110,000 annually, up from $85,000. Second-year analysts will make $125,000 per year, up from $90,000, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and asked for anonymity.
Salaries of associates were raised to $150,000 from $125,000, the source added. 
The new pay scale, reported earlier in the day by the Wall Street Journal, has been in effect since July 1 and follows similar moves by major Wall Street firms. The hikes are an attempt to attract and retain top talent and appropriately compensate for bankers' workload as dealmaking activity continues at an unprecedented pace.
In the United States, mergers and acquisitions worth $699 billion were announced in the second quarter this year, up 440% from last year. 
The blank-check frenzy has also started regaining momentum after a lull earlier this year, adding to the workload of bankers already grappling to meet the needs of more clients as the economy reopens.
Since last year, Jefferies has worked on a number of high-profile deals. It was among the underwriters for Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd, the biggest SPAC ever.

 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) and Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Ltd have also raised pay for their bankers working hard, after a grueling year that took a toll on their health and mental wellbeing.
Major Wall Street firms have been introducing incentives for younger staff after a group of first-year analysts at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) complained of long hours and ""unrealistic deadlines"" in an internal survey in March.

(Reuters) -Tyson Foods Inc cannot increase prices for chicken and prepared foods fast enough to keep pace with rising costs for raw materials like grain, Chief Executive Donnie King said on Monday, after the company reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings. 
The meat company lifted its 2021 revenue forecast due to strong beef demand as sales of steaks and burgers from U.S. restaurants and hotels recovered following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. U.S. beef exports are also robust.
But costs are also increasing, a potential drag on future earnings.
Tyson has increased prices for restaurant customers to offset inflation and plans to raise retail prices on Sept. 5, King said on a conference call with analysts. More increases are planned, he said.
""Costs are hitting us faster than we can get pricing at this point,"" King said. 
Branded and value-added products are particularly affected by inflation, which reached 14% in the quarter ended on July 3, he said. 
""We've seen unprecedented and accelerating inflation, and we're trying to catch up with that,"" King told reporters.
Tyson increased its average price for pork by 39.3% in the last quarter, while it raised beef and chicken prices 11.6% and 15.6% respectively. Sales volumes also increased.
Total quarterly sales climbed to $12.48 billion from $10.02 billion a year earlier, topping analysts' estimates for $11.49 billion.
Net income attributable to Tyson increased to $2.05 per share from $1.44 a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Tyson earned $2.70 per share, crushing estimates of $1.62, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The Jimmy Dean hotdogs maker said it expects total sales of about $46 billion to $47 billion for fiscal 2021, compared with an earlier forecast of $44 billion to $46 billion. 

The company, which is mandating COVID-19 vaccinations for U.S. employees, said rising coronavirus cases have made it harder to find workers.
""We were on a good trajectory and then the Delta variant showed up,"" King said.

458,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>","Amazon, top Indian seller Cloudtail end relationship amid regulatory heat","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc and one of its biggest sellers in India, Cloudtail, have decided to end their relationship, they said on Monday, following years of allegations from brick-and-mortar retailers that the seller received preferential treatment. 
A joint venture between Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and India's Catamaran that controlled Cloudtail was coming up for renewal on May 19, 2022, and the two sides said in a joint statement they had mutually decided not to extend it beyond that date.
The decision comes after a Reuters investigation https://reut.rs/3xyz8er in February based on Amazon documents showed the U.S. company had given preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers, including Cloudtail, and used them to bypass Indian laws. 
Amazon has said it does not give preferential treatment to any seller and that it complies with the law. 
In their joint statement, Amazon and Catamaran did not say why they had decided to end their joint venture, but said the partnership ran successfully for seven years and made ""tremendous strides."" 
Cloudtail had been controversial, with Indian brick-and-mortar retailers for years accusing Amazon of giving it preferential treatment which hurt smaller retailers.
It was formed when Amazon entered a joint venture with an entity formed by one of India’s most famous tech moguls, N.R. Narayana Murthy, which was then used to create Cloudtail, which began offering goods on Amazon.in after it was set up in August 2014.
The Reuters investigation in February found Amazon publicly called Cloudtail an independent seller offering goods on its marketplace website, but internal company documents revealed the U.S. company was deeply involved in expanding it and used it, among other sellers, to circumvent the country's foreign investment laws.
The story had triggered calls for a ban and an investigation of Amazon, and the financial crime fighting agency was looking into its findings. The antitrust watchdog had said the story corroborated evidence it https://reut.rs/2Xd8wTF had against Amazon.
Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors, told Reuters that Amazon and Catamaran's decision appeared aimed at defending against any possible future scrutiny of their business models.
""Before it comes under more scrutiny, they are basically disengaging themselves. But given the relationship has been there for years, this will still hang as a sword on their heads,"" said Singhal.
India is a key growth market for Amazon, where it has committed investment of $6.5 billion. But it's one where it has faced several regulatory challenges, including stricter laws that apply to foreign e-commerce giants.
The Reuters investigation in February found Amazon gave Cloudtail, and another seller named Appario, discounted fees.
Amazon is also in talks with the parent of Appario to determine whether it wants to renew its joint venture next year, a source with direct knowledge told Reuters on Monday. Appario did not respond to a request for comment.
The source added that multiple sellers in India were likely to take over Cloudtail's share on Amazon.in over time.

""There will be challenges, but the company is fairly confident it will manage,"" the source added.
Separately, India's Supreme Court on Monday ruled that Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Flipkart will have to face antitrust investigations https://reut.rs/3iuNFDA ordered against them in India, dealing a blow to the companies in their key growth market.

Investing.com – BioNTech stock (NASDAQ:BNTX) rose more than 9% Monday as the company said it is developing an updated version of the Covid-19 vaccine that targets the full spike protein of the Delta variant.
The company was back in black in the June quarter as its revenue soared more than 127 times. Total revenue came at 5.30 billion euro ($6.20 billion) compared to 41.7 million euro for the same quarter of 2020. Net profit was 2.78 billion euro compared to a loss of 88.3 million euro for the June quarter of 2020.
The German company and its partner in the Covid vaccine program,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), anticipate the clinical study of the updated version of their Covid vaccine to begin this month, subject to regulatory approvals. Expenses and profit from the vaccine are split equally between Pfizer and BioNTech. Pfizer was up 1%. 
Delta is the fastest spreading of all the mutants to have come out of the original coronavirus. It was first found in India and took thousands of lives there in April-May when the country reeled under its onslaught. The virus is now the most prevalent mutant in many countries. Some of those are now seeing a resurgence in Covid cases.
As governments fight vaccine hesitancy and rush to grab more shots from the select manufacturers, there is now talk of booster shots being needed to protect against the virus.
As of July 21, 2021, BioNTech and Pfizer have shipped approximately 1 billion doses to more than 100 countries or territories around the world.
BioNTech and Pfizer have signed orders of more than 2.2 billion doses for delivery in 2021 and more than 1 billion doses for 2022 and beyond as of the 21st of last month. The company said further discussions for additional dose commitments are ongoing and the order book is expected to grow.
The two companies expect annual manufacturing capacity of their Covid vaccine to reach 3 billion doses by the end of this year and scale that up to 4 billion doses in 2022.
BioNTech also provided an update on its second-quarter performance today as it swung to profit in the three months ended June 30 and comfortably beat all estimates.

Over the past three months, the stock of the Princeton, N.J.-based company has gained 11.6% to close Friday’s trading session at $30.51. Investors’ optimism around the company’s acquisition of Mt.

Read on.With the Fed’s continued support of the economy with its accommodative monetary policy, inflation has been rising. The Consumer Price Index hit 5.4% in June, its highest monthly gain since 2008. Furthermore, due to a resurgence of COVID cases across the country also, the stock market remains highly volatile.

Investing.com – Robinhood stock (NASDAQ:HOOD) was up 6% Monday as the latest meme stock catches fancy of more retail traders even as brokerages struggle with giving a target for the app.
The company had listed on the Nasdaq on July 29 after offering its shares in the $38 to $42 range. The shares were issued at the lower end and debuted at the same price before falling.
They didn’t trade above the issue price until August 3, when the Reddit gang took over, more than doubling the stock from $38. On August 4, it rose to a record high of $84.12.
Extreme volatility in the stock forced three halts in trading last week. It continues to rule the counter as the stock now trades 30% lower from its last week’s high, accounting for the session’s rise so far.  
The online brokerage sold as much as 25% of its IPO shares to 301,573 of its retail customers, representing about 1.3% of the platform’s 22.5 million funded accounts.
The bug that has struck the likes of AMC (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME), Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS), Clover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) in a battle of small traders pitched against the Wall Street giants has now engulfed Robinhood, too.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 09:30AM ET</span>","Samsung leader Jay Y. Lee granted parole, to leave prison on Friday","By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics vice chairman Jay Y. Lee, in jail after convictions for bribery, embezzlement and other charges, has qualified for parole and is expected to leave prison this Friday, South Korea's justice ministry said.
""The decision to grant Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) vice chairman Jay Y. Lee parole was the result of a comprehensive review of various factors such as public sentiment and good behavior during detention,"" the ministry said in a statement on Monday.
Convicted of bribing a friend of former President Park Geun-hye, Lee, 53, has served 18 months of a revised 30 month sentence. He initially served one year of a five-year sentence from August 2017 which was later suspended. That court decision was then overturned and while the sentence was shortened, he was sent back to jail in January this year.
Support for his parole, both political and public and from the wider business community, had grown amid anxiety that key strategic decisions are not being made at the South Korean tech giant.
Although the day-to-day running of the world's biggest memory chip maker and smartphone manufacturer has not been affected by his absence, company sources say decisions on major investment and M&A projects should only be made by Lee.
In particular, a decision on the location of a $17 billion U.S. plant to produce advanced logic chips awaits his return at a time when there is a global chip shortage and rivals like TSMC and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) are making large investments.
The Federation of Korean Industries, a big business lobby, said in a statement that it welcomed the decision to grant Lee parole. 
""If the investment clock, currently at standstill, is not wound up quickly, we could lag behind global companies such as Intel and TSMC and lose the Korean economy's bread and butter at a moment's notice."" 
Lee still needs the Justice Minister to approve his return to work as the law bars persons with certain convictions from working for companies related to those convictions for five years. 
He is likely to get that, legal experts say, due to circumstances such as the amount deemed embezzled having been repaid.
Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics declined to comment. 
HIGH SUPPORT
South Korea's biggest conglomerates are still owned and controlled by their founding families and there is little precedence for handing over the reins to outsiders even when a senior family member has been jailed. 
While polls showed high public support of around 70% for Lee's parole, many civic groups have been opposed, accusing the administration of President Moon Jae-In of hypocrisy after it came to power on a wave of anger at corruption among South Korea's political and business elite.
""If the administration that benefited grants preferential parole for a chaebol owner, we must reconsider the very existence of the Moon Jae-in administration,"" said Kim Ju-ho, official at activist group People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, using the local term for large family-owned businesses. 
Lee's legal woes have not been confined to the bribery conviction. He is also on trial accused of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger of two Samsung companies.

A South Korean court also decided in June that he should be tried in separate case in which he has been accused of unlawfully using a sedative. 
Lee has denied the accusations in both cases.

With this in mind, we believe investors are better off avoiding marijuana stocks  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC), Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB), and Neptune Wellness Solutions (NASDAQ:NEPT) for the time being based on their accelerating losses and weak fundamentals. Read on.The marijuana industry has been attracting significant investor attention lately as the push for federal-level legalization gains momentum and the stigma surrounding the use of pot declines. As of June 2021, recreational marijuana was legal in 19 states.
Despite overall optimism, pot legalization at the federal level still has few hurdles to cross. Last month, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer released draft legislation of the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, which would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act. However, given that the bill does not yet have sufficient votes to push it through the Senate because some Republicans and moderate Democrats oppose the decriminalization of marijuana, the prospects of federal-level legalization look uncertain at best. Also, it is still unclear whether President Biden would sign the bill into law.
Amid this uncertainty, we think investors should avoid cannabis stocks with weak fundamentals and growth prospects. Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC), Aurora Cannabis Inc. (ACB), and Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc. (NEPT) are examples of cannabis concerns that are struggling to stay afloat due to their weak financials. Therefore, we believe these stocks are best avoided now.

The deal would see Sanderson Farms, the third-largest poultry producer in the United States, join hands with smaller rival Continental Grain's Wayne Farms to compete better with rivals  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) and Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Corp.
Wayne Farms Chief Executive Officer Clint Rivers will lead the combined business, which will be privately held upon the deal's closure expected to be by early 2022.
Cargill and Continental Grain will pay Sanderson Farms shareholders $203 apiece, representing a premium of about 11% to the stock's closing price on Friday.
The offer price also represents a 30.3% premium to the stock's closing price on June 18, before reports emerged about Sanderson Farms exploring a sale.
Shares of Sanderson Farms rose 8% to $196.65 in premarket trading on Monday.
Prices of chicken products, especially those of wings and breasts, have risen as easing pandemic-related restrictions bring consumers back to restaurants and more fast-food chains add new menu items to lure customers.
Yum Brands Inc's KFC and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc's Burger King have launched new chicken sandwiches, while Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) Inc has been doubling down on chicken thighs.
Sanderson Farms, which sells frozen chicken to several U.S. retailers and restaurants, processed over 4.8 billion pounds of meat in fiscal 2020.

Last year, Sanderson Farms rejected an unsolicited takeover offer of $142 per share from investment firm Durational Capital Management.
J.P. Morgan analysts said in June a deal between Continental Grain and Sanderson Farms would draw government attention, as a combined entity would control about 15% of the U.S. chicken market and given recent lawsuits regarding chicken price fixing.

(Reuters) -Barrick Gold Corp, said on Monday it was not expecting a major hit from inflation this year and stuck to its full-year forecasts as prices for the yellow metal tick up. 
Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said the miner had accounted for costs at current levels, but if costs climbed further, Barrick could see a 1% hit. 
He also said the company did not expect to exceed costs on new projects even though there was some impact, particularly from rising steel prices. 
Last month, rival Newmont warned of rising costs for materials, energy and labor in second half of the year and in 2022, adding aggregate costs were seen rising about 5% when steel, fuel and oils were factored in.
Barrick reiterated its plans to spend between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion, and all-in-sustaining costs of $970 per ounce to $1,020 per ounce of gold and $2-$2.20 per pound of copper in 2021. 
It maintained its production estimate of 4.4 million ounces to 4.7 million ounces of gold attributable to the company, and 410 million pounds to 460 million pounds of copper. 
Production fell 9.4% to 1.04 million ounces in the second quarter, while realized gold prices rose 5.5% to $1,820 per ounce as a weaker dollar and safe-haven buying due to pandemic-related uncertainties boosted demand.
Barrick's all-in-sustaining costs, a metric that reflects total costs associated with production, rose 5.4% to $1,087 per ounce of gold. 
U.S.-listed shares of the company, which have fallen 8% this year, were down 1.4% in premarket trading, tracking a dip in gold prices. 

Shares of global miners have fallen this year after surging on record high gold prices last year. 
Barrick's second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 29 cents beat estimates of 26 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES. Revenue of $2.89 billion, however, missed estimates of $2.92 billion.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening largely lower Monday, falling back from the previous session’s record levels with sharp falls in oil, gold prices weighing on the commodity sector.
By 8:34 AM ET (1234 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 100 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures traded 8 points, or 0.2%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 13 points, or 0.1%.
On Friday, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up over 144 points, or 0.4%, at an all-time high of 35,208.51, while the broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.2% to also post a record close. The Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend, dipping 0.4%.
However, that positive tone has largely dissipated Monday, with a slump in oil prices on the back of falling crude oil imports in China, the world’s biggest energy consumer, weighing on the heavyweight energy stocks.
Covid cases are rising again in China, and the associated new mobility restrictions have prompted Goldman Sachs, along with other influential investment banks, to cut its full-year Chinese GDP growth estimate to 8.3% from 8.6%. 
Meanwhile, U.S. crude futures were down 4.2% at $65.39 a barrel, after falling nearly 7% last week, the steepest weekly decline in nine months, while Brent futures were down 3.8% at $68.02 a barrel, having dropped 6% last week, the biggest weekly loss in four months.
This hit U.S. oil stocks hard, with  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) down 1.6% premarket,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) 1.7% lower, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) 2.5% lower and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) dropped 2.1% 
Gold prices also slumped to the lowest level since March, falling below $1,700/oz before posting a minor recovery to currently change hands for $1,744.65/oz, still around 4% lower over the last week.
Metal miners also came under pressure, with gold prices slumping to the lowest level since March and base metals. Including copper, also weakening. The stock of Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX), the world's largest publicly traded copper producer, fell 2%. 
Still, there is some good news available with the U.S. Senate likely to pass a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill early this week, resulting in the largest U.S. investment in roads and bridges in decades.
The economic data slate centers around the June JOLTS survey, a report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to help measure job vacancies, but the main focus will be on speeches by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Richmond Fed head Thomas Barkin later Monday.
Both Fed policymakers are known to lean towards the central bank tapering its bond-buying program sooner rather than later, so their comments will be closely watched, particularly after Friday’s strong payrolls number.
The second-quarter earnings season is drawing to a close, but there are still a number of influential companies set to report this week. This includes the likes of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC),  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN),Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and DoorDash (NYSE:DASH).

Investing.com -- Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) stock was trading 1.5% lower in Monday’s premarket following a downgrade by Deutsche Bank to ‘hold’ with a target of $102.
The new price set by analyst Krisztina Katai is 21% lower from the previous target of $129 and just 3.3% higher from the stock’s Friday close of $98.77.
According to Katai, while the brokerage continues to have faith in the company for the long-term but with inflationary pressures building up, the risk-reward doesn’t really favor the stock. She blamed rising freight and wage costs for the pressure that Dollar Tree banner's fixed $1 price point would come under.
Shipping and freight costs have multiplied in the last one year as COVID-19 disrupted supply chains and cities came under lockdowns. Crude touched multi-year highs and trucking costs rose. The phenomenon could persist as demand comes back and economies recover.   
Dollar Tree’s tight pricing limits the discount chain’s ability to absorb higher costs through price increases, putting margins at risk.
The analyst pointed out that Dollar Tree's operating margins have been under pressure for a number of years.
The analyst said the expansion of multi-price-point Dollar Tree Plus could positively offset the issue but ruled out any accelerated rolling out of the format before 2023."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's biggest online commerce firm,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, on Monday said it had fired a manager accused of sexual assault, and promised policies to prevent sexual harassment, but was blasted by state media for not acting until the accuser went public.
On Saturday, a female employee posted an 11-page account on Alibaba's intranet saying her manager and a client had sexually assaulted her, and that superiors and human resources had not taken the matter seriously in the five days since she reported it.
Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said in an intranet memo that the manager, at the grocery delivery unit Neighbourhood Retail, had said he was involved in ""intimate acts"" when the employee was inebriated, and ""has been fired and will never be rehired"". He said police were investigating the matter.
Reuters was unable to reach the manager for comment.
Later on Monday, police in the city of Jinan, where the alleged incident took place, said that the client was under investigation.
State media and online commentators were overwhelmingly critical of Alibaba's perceived delay in handling the incident.
""Alibaba could not offer an answer that satisfies public opinion for this ham-handed inaction,"" said an editorial in the Global Times tabloid, published by the state-run People's Daily. 
Internally, on a group chat dedicated to the issue, staff have demanded justice and measures to prevent sexual harassment. A notice, on Alibaba's workplace messaging app DingTalk, showed the group had more than 6,000 members as of Sunday.
The incident has also sparked internal discussion over the company's culture, said an Alibaba employee, who was not authorised to speak with media and so declined to be identified. 
The employee said Alibaba was facing heavy pressure from public opinion and there was a need for it to ""scrape poison off the bone"" - a Chinese expression meaning to remove a harmful portion to save the whole.
Alibaba has faced the ire of both the public and authorities in the past year and a half. In April 2020, users of the eponymous microblog of Alibaba-backed Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) Corp complained that critical reports on the platform about an affair involving a top Alibaba executive had disappeared.
And as recently as March, Alibaba was fined a record $2.75 billion for anti-competitive behaviour.
In his memo, Zhang announced company-wide training for the prevention of sexual harassment. He also said Alibaba was staunchly opposed to ""the ugly culture of forced drinking"".

The female employee said in her account of the incident that her manager had ordered her to drink.
""This incident is a humiliation for all Alibaba employees. We must rebuild, and we must change,"" Zhang said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Four investment groups are looking to acquire the Israeli port of Haifa estimated to be valued as high as $600 million with formal bids expected towards October, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Israel is selling its state-owned ports and building new private docks in an effort to encourage competition and bring down costs. At the same time, warming ties with neighbouring Arab countries are creating new trade opportunities and Haifa is well placed to become a regional hub.
A new container terminal run by China's Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG) is opening this year just up the coast and Haifa port will have to be upgraded to compete.
Final offers are expected around October, an official with the Government Companies Authority (GCA), which is handling the sale, told Reuters. A winner should be chosen before the end of the year with ownership transferred at the beginning of 2022.
Contenders come from Israel, Europe, India and the United Arab Emirates, which only last year normalised ties with Israel.
The GCA official said the sale was ""an orderly, international process"", adding: ""geopolitics is not a factor"". 
To attract investors who may have concerns about competing with the Chinese-run terminal across the bay, Israel is selling Haifa port with a war chest of about 1.9 billion shekels ($590 million), lots of land to develop and growing consumer demand for goods, the GCA official said.
""We plan to make Haifa the gateway to the Middle East,"" said Shlomi Fogel, co-owner of Israel Shipyards Industries, which is jointly bidding with Dubai’s DP World for the port. ""We have all the ingredients to make it happen.""
Britain's DAO Shipping has teamed up with Israeli infrastructure fund Generation Capital and London-headquartered shipping company Lomar is finalising its participation in the consortium, DAO and Lomar’s parent group Libra said. 
""We want the port of Haifa to become a major port for general cargo, cars, roro (roll-on/roll-off ships) and cruise (liners),"" DAO Shipping's CEO Danny Ungar told Reuters. 
Libra's CEO George Logothetis said the project had ""the potential to turn the port into a multi-cargo strategic hub that will massively benefit Israel and the wider region"". 

India’s Adani Ports is separately partnering with Israel's Gadot Group, and a fourth suitor includes Israel's Shafir Engineering, industry sources said.
Shafir and Gadot declined to comment, while officials at Adani did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) -Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) all cut their China growth forecasts on Monday, after export growth slowed unexpectedly and on concerns that the resurgent coronavirus could crimp economic activity.
Chinese trade data released over the weekend undershot forecasts, while figures out on Monday showed inflation rising in the country's factory sector, potentially adding extra strains.
JPMorgan reduced its quarter-on-quarter growth estimate for the third three months of the year to 2.0% from 4.3%, and trimmed its full-year forecast to 8.9% from 9.1%. 
Morgan Stanley lowered its quarterly forecast to 1.6%, while Goldman cut its estimate to 2.3% from 5.8% and to 8.3% versus 8.6% for the full year.
""Recent developments point at further downside risks to already soft 3Q growth forecasts, related to the spread of the Delta variant, a series of regulatory changes in new economy sectors, and erosion of market confidence,"" JPMorgan's analysts said.
Both JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley also predicted Chinese authorities would respond with support measures.
On the monetary policy front, JPMorgan said the People's Bank of China's main policy rates were likely to be trimmed by 5 basis points in the fourth quarter, while it would deliver two more 50 basis point cuts to banks' reserve requirements (RRR), the first in October and another in January. 
It has already provided one cut last month.

Morgan Stanley said it expected one 50 bps RRR cut before the end of the year and that government bond issuance could accelerate in coming months to support infrastructure investment.
""A mild deceleration in exports in 2H and an ongoing slowdown in domestic demand amid Delta resurgence mean policy support could ramp up in coming months,"" the bank said.

Sky News first reported Virgin's plans for an initial public offering on Saturday, saying an autumn announcement was likely.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Citi have been appointed by the airline to handle the float, a source familiar with the situation said.
But analysts said Virgin, which has declined to comment on the IPO plans, may need to wait longer. 
""This is a bit of a strange time to be selling airline shares,"" said  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) equity analyst Laura Hoy. 
Like most airlines, Virgin has been brought to its knees by the pandemic, with the carrier even more severely affected than rival British Airways due to its focus on Britain-U.S. routes, which still remain partially closed.
Branson owns 51% of Virgin Atlantic through his Virgin Group and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) owns the rest. 
Virgin has survived the pandemic thanks to a 1.5 billion pound ($2.08 billion) rescue between Sept. 2020 and March 2021 and axing around half its staff to cut costs.
The company now wants to bring in new investment to boost its finances as the outlook for travel brightens. 
Fully vaccinated American citizens are now able to fly to Britain without the need to quarantine, but most Britons cannot freely travel to the United States. 
""The pitch to investors will clearly be the timing of the return to normalised demand and business traffic, with this challenged by concerns over the longevity of government-imposed restrictions,"" analysts at Goodbody said in a note. ""That debate will be central if the listing is launched as early as the autumn."" 
There is no clarity on when the United States will reverse its ban on UK arrivals, and, globally passenger numbers are not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023, industry body IATA has said. 

Virgin has pointed to a pick-up in demand. The airline has said bookings from New York to London surged by nearly 250% in the week when Britain changed rules for U.S. arrivals, and said it was also helped by Caribbean routes and cargo. 
But the group's track record on profitability could cause concerns for investors. The pandemic pushed the company to a 659 million pound loss for 2020, but over the three years before COVID-19 restrictions, it also made a loss, the group's annual reports show.

Uber intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to finance a portion of the consideration payable in cash, and certain related fees and expenses incurred, in connection with the acquisition of Transplace by Uber Freight, a subsidiary of Uber.
In a deal signed last month with TPG Capital, the private equity platform of alternative asset firm TPG, Uber Freight will buy Transplace for approximately $2.25 billion, comprising up to $750 million in common stock of its parent and the remainder in cash.
The acquisition is part of Uber’s efforts to look for revenue streams beyond cab aggregation. The Uber Freight-Transplace combine will create one of the largest managed transportation and logistics networks in the world.

KoBold, which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to hunt for raw materials, will pay $15 million in exploration funding for the Disko-Nuussuaq project on Greenland's west coast in exchange for a 51% stake in the project, Bluejay said in a statement.
Shares in BlueJay traded 26% higher on the news.
The license holds metals such as nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum and the funding will cover evaluation and initial drilling. 
KoBold is owned by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate and technology fund backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, Bloomberg founder Michael Bloomberg, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, and Ray Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.
Other KoBold investors include Silicon Valley venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz and Norwegian state-controlled energy company Equinor.

BlueJay said previous studies found the area in western Greenland has similarities to the geology of Russia's Norilsk region, a main producer of nickel and palladium.
""This agreement is transformative for Bluejay,"" said the comany's CEO Bo Steensgaard. ""We are delighted to have a partner at the pinnacle of technical innovation for new exploration methods, backed by some of the most successful investors in the world.""

Shares in Deliveroo, which disclosed the holding in a stock market notice on Monday, rose 11% to 360 pence. They were priced at 390 pence in its initial public offering.
""Delivery Hero is always looking for new investment opportunities,"" the German company said.
""We strongly believe in the future potential of the delivery industry as a whole and therefore decided to purchase shares in one of the companies that is at its forefront.""
Shares in Delivery Hero, a constituent of Germany's blue-chip DAX share index, were down 1.3% in late morning trading in Frankfurt.
The stake was valued at about 284 million pounds (335 million euros) based on Friday's closing price.
Online food platforms such as Delivery Hero, Deliveroo, Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Just Eat Takeaway.com have benefited from a surge in demand during pandemic lockdowns, but some analysts question how much of that business will persist as restaurants reopen. Despite a jump in sales Delivery Hero and Deliveroo continue to make losses.
A race into new markets and early moves towards consolidation have resulted in a number of cross-shareholdings in the sector.
Founded in 2011, Delivery Hero operates in about 50 countries worldwide, with particular strength in Asia, where it owns the foodpanda brand.
In many countries it offers quick commerce, using its riders to deliver groceries, pharmaceutical products and electronics alongside restaurant food. 
In May it announced its return to the German market, where it competes with Takeaway.com.
Delivery Hero does not operate in Britain - Deliveroo's largest market - after selling its Hungryhouse business to Just Eat in 2016.
However, after later consolidation in Germany, it has a 7.4% stake in Just Eat Takeaway.com. 
It also owns 37% of Spain's Glovo, which is considering its own listing in about three years.
Deliveroo listed with a dual-class share structure that gives co-founder and chief executive Will Shu a majority of the voting rights for three years.
It currently operates in 12 markets, including Australia, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Italy, but the UK and Ireland account for more than half of its orders by value.

Deliveroo, which reports first-half results on Wednesday, did not comment further.

Investing.com --  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) stock was up 7% in Monday’s premarket trading on a report in The Wall Street Journal that the chicken producer is nearing a deal to sell itself to Cargills (CM:CARG) and agricultural-investment firm Continental Grain in a deal worth around $4.5 billion.
It would value Sanderson at $203 a share, an 11.3% premium to the poultry giant’s Friday closing of $182.37.
Cargill is one of the world’s biggest processed food companies, selling its own brands, besides also trading in grains, oilseeds and meat.
Continental Grain owns a smaller chicken processor Wayne Farms. A deal will give the Sanderson-Wayne combine a market share of about 15% of U.S. chicken production, according to the WSJ report.  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) dominates the market.

Started in 1905 by William Lewis Moody Jr., American National is majority-owned by the founder's family, which controls the company through a range of trusts and holdings.
The company offers several products, including life, health, and property and casualty (P&C) insurance, as well as annuities, according to its website.
The potential deal comes as U.S. insurers are stepping up sales of annuities and other capital-intensive assets amid a surge in interest from new and established private equity buyers hungry to boost the amount of money they manage.
American International Group (NYSE:AIG), for example, plans to use an initial public offering to sell part of its life and retirement business, while Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) last month agreed to buy a sizeable stake.
Canada's Brookfield said in October it would acquire a stake in American Equity Investment Life (NYSE:AEL) Holding Co and grant the fixed index annuity provider access to Brookfield's alternative assets.
American National shareholders will receive $190 per share in cash, representing a premium of about 10% to the insurer's closing price on Friday. https://on.wsj.com/3lH84at
Reuters reported in May that American National was exploring options including a sale of the company, citing people familiar with the matter.
The potential deal follows corporate results that show a return to hefty profits for insurers after they took a hit last year as claims rose due to the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Brookfield plans to keep American National's headquarters in Galveston, Texas, and maintain its operational hubs around the country.

The merger is expected to close in the first half of 2022.
RBC Capital Markets is serving as financial adviser to Brookfield Reinsurance, while Citi is American National's financial adviser.

490,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 07:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: India considers sharp import tax cuts on EVs after Tesla lobbying - sources,"By Aftab Ahmed and Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is considering slashing import duties on electric cars to as low as 40%, two senior government officials told Reuters, days after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's appeals for a cut polarised the country's auto industry. 
For imported electric vehicles (EVs) with a value of less than $40,000 - including the car's cost, insurance and freight - the government is discussing slashing the tax rate to 40% from 60% presently, the officials told Reuters. 
For EVs valued at more than $40,000, it is looking at cutting the rate to 60% from 100%, they said.
""We haven't firmed up the reduction in duties yet, but there are discussions that are ongoing,"" one of the officials said. 
India is the world's fifth-largest car market with annual sales of about 3 million vehicles but the majority of cars sold are priced below $20,000. EVs make up a fraction of the total and luxury EV sales are negligible, according to industry estimates. 
Tesla, in its pitch to the government - first reported by Reuters in July, argued that lowering import duties on EVs to 40% would make them more affordable and boost sales. This triggered a rare public debate among automakers over whether such a move would contradict India's push to increase domestic manufacturing.
Even so, the government is in favour of a cut if it can see companies such as Tesla providing some benefit to the domestic economy - manufacture locally, for example, or give a firm timeline on when it would be able to, one of the officials said.
""Reducing import duties is not a problem as not many EVs are imported in the country. But we need some economic gain out of that. We also have to balance the concerns of the domestic players,"" the official said.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter last month that a local factory in India was ""quite likely"" if the company was successful with vehicle imports but taxes on them are high. 
The second official said that since the duty cut is being considered only for EVs and not other categories of imported cars, it should not be a concern for domestic automakers - that mainly manufacture affordable gasoline-powered cars.
India's finance and commerce ministries, as well as its federal think tank Niti Aayog, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are discussing the proposal and all stakeholders will be consulted, the person added.
Both sources did not want to be identified as the discussions are still private.
India's commerce and finance ministries as well as Niti Aayog did not immediately provide comment.
Automakers including Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz and Audi have for years lobbied for lower import duties on luxury cars but faced strong resistance mainly from domestic companies. As a result, India's luxury car market has remained small with average sales of around 35,000 vehicles a year. 
Tesla's cars would fall into the high-end EV category, which are mainly imported into India and account for a much smaller percentage of sales. Mercedes, Jaguar Land Rover and Audi sell imported luxury EVs in the country. 
This time Tesla's demands have found support from Mercedes as well as South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, which has around an 18% share of India's car market.
Opposing the proposed cut are  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), which produces affordable electric cars in the country, and Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group-backed Ola, which is making electric scooters in India.

A third source familiar with the government's thinking said there was awareness that a brand such as Tesla can make electric cars more penetrable in India, which is lagging other major auto markets in EV sales.
The government is thinking about the best way to approach this and they want to see some benefit even if that only means Tesla pledges to source parts domestically, the person said.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 06:55AM ET</span>",Morrisons suitor CD&R gets more time to trump $9.3 billion offer,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -Morrisons suitor, U.S. private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), has won more time to consider a counter bid to Fortress' agreed 6.7 billion pounds ($9.3 billion) offer for the British supermarket group.
Britain's Takeover Panel, which regulates corporate takeovers, said on Monday CD&R would have until Aug. 20 to announce a firm intention to make a new offer or walk away, a so-called ""put-up or shut-up"" order, extending a previous Aug. 9 deadline.
The battle for Britain's fourth-largest grocer after Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda, is the most high-profile looming takeover in the country amid a raft of bids and counter bids, reflecting private equity's appetite for UK Plc.
Morrisons on Friday approved the raised 272 pence a share offer from the consortium led by Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) owned Fortress Investment Group - a 52% premium to its share price before takeover interest emerged.
The retailer had requested the Takeover Panel set a revised deadline for CD&R.
On Friday, Morrisons also adjourned from Aug. 16 to Aug. 27 the shareholder meeting to vote on the Fortress offer. To pass, it would need the support of shareholders representing at least 75% in value of voting investors at the meeting.
Shares in Morrisons were trading at nearly 279 pence on Monday - above Fortress' new offer, indicating investors expect a higher bid.
Analysts have also speculated that U.S. giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a partnership deal with Morrisons, could still enter the fray.
SYNERGIES
CD&R, which has former Tesco boss Terry Leahy as a senior adviser, had a 230 pence a share proposal worth 5.52 billion pounds rejected by Morrisons on June 17.
Last month, Morrisons' board agreed to Fortress' 254 pence a share offer worth 6.3 billion pounds but major Morrisons investors Silchester, M&G and JO Hambro all indicated it was too low.
Fortress, which bought British wine seller Majestic Wine in 2019, has said it ""remains committed to becoming the new owner of Morrisons."" 
The Fortress consortium, which also includes Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Koch Real Estate Investments and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, has given assurances that it would retain Morrisons' headquarters in Bradford, northern England, and its existing management team led by Chief Executive David Potts, and execute its existing strategy. Material store sale and leaseback transactions are not planned.
People with knowledge of the situation have said CD&R would also be able to tick those boxes to secure a recommendation from Morrisons' board.
They said CD&R, whose track record includes investment in UK discount retailer B&M, was likely to stress the greater synergies they would get from a deal, given its existing ownership of the Motor Fuel Group petrol forecourt chain.

However, some analysts have argued that a higher bid makes asset sales more likely.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 06:46AM ET</span>","Airbus sees 1,000 German jobs at risk without parts unit spinoff - source","By Alexander Hübner
MUNICH (Reuters) - Airbus has warned employees of hundreds of possible job losses at its small-parts manufacturing business in Germany if the unit is not hived off in line with a cost-cutting strategy set out in April, a source familiar with the plan told Reuters.
The group sees 1,000 of its 2,500 small-parts manufacturing jobs in Germany at risk if it continues to manufacture parts within the group rather than spinning off the activities, said the source who is familiar with plans presented to its works council and trade unions.
Under the shakeup set out four months ago, Airbus's Premium Aerotec unit in Germany would be split off, with part combined with other Airbus manufacturing plants and the rest folded into a new business specialising in small mass-produced ""detail"" parts which could be spun off.
Premium Aerotec makes components for commercial and military aircraft, mainly in Augsburg and Varel near Bremen.
The unit has been lossmaking for years and Airbus argues that with a new owner it could also work for competitors or win customers from other industries, and thus better utilise its workforce.
The planemaker has previously said it calculates that Premium Aerotec is between 25% and 30% more expensive than other suppliers. Airbus declined to comment when asked about the numbers of jobs at risk under the restructuring.
Trade union IG Metall is opposed to the spinoff, fearing job cuts and less favourable working conditions after a break-up of the unit, at which fuselages of Airbus aircraft are also assembled.
The issue is taking on a political dimension. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrats' (SPD) chancellor candidate for September's federal election, is planning a ""solidarity visit"" on Monday to Premium Aerotec in Varel.
Airbus has also promised to examine a future for parts production within the group.
""Our analysis, which we shared with employee representatives at the end of July, clearly showed that the internal route would be much more painful for employees to achieve competitive cost structures,"" a spokesperson said.
Therefore, he said, the company wanted to find a better owner who could preserve more jobs. Switzerland's Montana Aerospace has already expressed interest.

""The window of opportunity to reposition is now, before production rates return to pre-crisis levels,"" the Airbus spokesperson said. 
(This story has been refiled to clarify in second paragraph the nature of the jobs)

Investing.com -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was trading 1.2% higher in Monday’s premarket following an upgrade to ‘buy’ from Jefferies with a target of $850 from the previous $700.
The stock was earlier rated ‘neutral’ at the brokerage. The new target price is 21.6% higher from the stock’s Friday close of $699.10.
The company's decision to make it mandatory for workers at its Reno-area facility in Nevada to wear a mask, irrespective of their vaccination status, also added to the positive sentiment, given it shows the intent of the company to keep its engines humming and get on with life-as-usual while dealing with the pandemic. The company cited the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus for its move. Earlier, vaccinated workers were excused from wearing the mask.  
The electric vehicle maker’s second-quarter results, declared on July 26, drove Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) to revise the forecast. Both earnings and topline came above expectations.
Tesla’s automotive revenue almost doubled and income from operations soared more than four-fold, helped by record sales of its electric vehicles. The company delivered 201,304 vehicles during the quarter and upheld its full-year forecast despite the global chip shortage that has disrupted the plans of most automotive groups this year.
Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.45 on total revenue of $11.95 billion which rose 98%. Delivery numbers were also high on investors' minds, and these too were ahead of estimates. The average selling price of its vehicles fell 2% year-on-year and that was expected as the share of cheaper Made-in-China units in the total mix grew.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 06:35AM ET</span>",Take Five: Dodging the summer squalls,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Below are five events and themes likely to dominate global financial markets this week.
1/INFLATION PALPITATIONS
U.S. consumer price data out on Wednesday will provide some answers to one of the most pressing questions in world markets at the moment: how sustainable is the current surge in U.S. inflation?
Last month's jump of 0.9% was the strongest gain since June 2008. May was pretty punchy too at 0.6% and economists polled by Reuters think July's figure won't be far behind, at 0.5%.
The Federal Reserve's hawks are watching these figures, well, like hawks. After Friday's strong payrolls data, another hot number will bolster their case for the central bank reeling in stimulus sooner rather than later. That could cause summer squalls in the record high stock markets and the red hot bond markets. 
Graphic: CPI has jumped in recent months, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mopanmzqxva/Pasted%20image%201628114057120.png 
2/HOLI-DAZED 
Back in March,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) predicted another lost summer for tourism, surprising some, given the vaccine optimism at the time. Now in August, when beaches and cities are normally packed with holidaymakers, their call looks bang on. 
Spain welcomed 75% fewer tourists last month than in June 2019. Greek islands, billed as ""COVID-free"", are coming under travel curbs again, as well as suffering wildfires. Thailand's Phuket has just 1% of the visitors it had before the pandemic. Turkey's second-quarter tourism revenues were $3 billion, versus $8 billion in Q2 2019, while Kenya welcomed just 300,000 visitors in H1 compared to 2 million in 2019.
Given that tourism directly contributes 6% of European GDP and nearly 8% of employment, it is unsurprising the euro zone services business expectations index has slipped to three-month lows and European travel shares have lost 13% since April. The Thai baht has slumped to its lowest since 2018. It's enough to make you need a holiday. 
Graphic: Tourism shares, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkvlgmzeypb/Pasted%20image%201628160517254.png 
3/HEADWINDS IN ASIA
Chinese data over the weekend and in coming days is showing how much damage Beijing’s regulatory crackdown, recent floods in Henan province and the new COVID-19 wave - both at home in and in nearby countries - is doing to the giant economy. 
There is plenty to ponder. China's export growth has unexpectedly slowed, data on Monday showed, yet inflation in the country's huge factories was higher than expected, highlighting the pressure coming from rising raw material costs.
Headwinds to growth are already spurring calls for further cuts to reserve requirements and even possibly policy rates, both in China and its neighbourhood. Tourism-dependent Thailand’s currency is at 2018 lows forcing the Bank of Thailand to turn dovish while the Philippines might copy China's lead on Thursday and cut it own bank reserve requirements. 
Graphic: China cracks down on tech, tutoring and property, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byprjorzzpe/techtutoringproperty.jpg 
4/COVID CLAIMS
Tried to get COVID insurance and failed? Most of Europe's big insurers have stripped cover for the pandemic from their policies, setting them up for much stronger results than last year, when the virus caught them unawares. 
France's AXA and Italy's Generali (MI:GASI) and Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) have notched good numbers already and next week sees the turn of Zurich, Dutch pair Aegon (NYSE:AEG) and  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) and Britain's  Aviva  (LON:AV), M&G and Prudential (NYSE:PUK).
And it is not only the COVID life insurance of business claims that will be of interest. Activist investor Cevian recently grabbed a 5% stake at Aviva and Prudential is in the process of severing its U.S. arm after pressure from another corporate raider, Third Point (NYSE:SPNT). 
Graphic: Europe's insurance firms, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykerbdpg/Pasted%20image%201628237596921.png 
5/ZAMBIA VOTES
Zambia goes to the polls on Thursday in what looks like being a close fought election between incumbent president Edgar Lungu and serial challenger Hakainde Hichilema, known as HH.
Analysts say it is likely to decided by young and first-time voters frustrated by an economy with the highest unemployment in 10 years and soaring living costs due to a collapsing currency.

It is also in default. A debt restructuring has been put on hold until after the election but it is not just any restructuring. It is supposed to be the first big test of the 'Common Framework' debt relief plan set up by G20 nations last year. They need Zambia to be a success so that other reluctant countries follow it, so whoever wins the election will be firmly in the spotlight.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>","Philip Morris, Carlyle could fight it out for UK's Vectura in auction ring","By Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) -The takeover battle for drugmaker Vectura will enter a rare head-to-head auction process if private equity group Carlyle and tobacco giant Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) do not make final bids by Tuesday, according to a British regulator. 
""The auction procedure provides for up to five days of public bidding,"" UK's Takeover Panel said in a statement on Monday, adding that auctioning would begin on Wednesday and neither party can make a revised proposal after 5:00 PM BST (1600 GMT) on Aug. 10. 
Vectura has been the target of several approaches since May from the U.S.-based groups, which are eyeing the London-listed drugmaker's expertise with inhalable formulations and device designs for respiratory therapies for illnesses such as asthma.
The Takeover Panel's decision comes a day after Philip Morris raised its offer for Vectura to 165 pence per share after Carlyle and Vectura agreed to a sweetened, 155 pence proposal from the private equity group on Friday. 
Vectura, whose shares gained 5% by 0958 GMT, separately said on Monday it was withdrawing its recommendation for Carlyle's latest offer and that it had no intention yet to recommend Philip Morris' proposal from Sunday.
The drugmaker, which counts Novartis and GSK among its customers and is also working on a potential inhaled treatment for COVID-19, has voiced concerns around Philip Morris' ownership, saying it might be better positioned under Carlyle.
Only a handful of bidding wars have slipped into an auction process in recent years. In 2018, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) beat Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox in an auction for pay-television group Sky.
However, the Vectura saga is the second this year to see an intervention from the Takeover Panel after  G4S  (CSE:G4S) in February. But, a deal for the security firm was finalised without suitors going head-to-head in an auction.

Takeovers for British companies hit a 14-year high by value in the first seven months of 2021, driven by relatively cheap valuations due in part to the pandemic and Brexit.
Morrisons, Britain's fourth-largest supermarket group, is also a high-profile takeover target, reflecting private equity's appetite for UK Plc.

The deal consolidates more than 90% of the country's credit cards industry into the hands of Australia's Big Four banks, with NAB adding a million customers through the deal to become the nation's second-largest credit card provider.
""The proposed acquisition ... brings scale and deep expertise in unsecured lending, particularly credit cards, which continue to be an important way for customers to make payments,"" said NAB Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan.
""Access to a greater share of payments and transaction data will help drive product and service innovation across our personal banking business."" 
Credit card payments in Australia have been shrinking as government pandemic cheques have been used to pay down debt and younger generations turn to buy now pay later (BNPL) providers such as Afterpay to pay in 'interest-free' instalments. 
The deal, which needs to be approved by the competition regulator, includes a A$4.3 billion unsecured lending portfolio, A$7.9 billion in residential mortgages, about A$9 billion in deposits and 800 Citi employees. 
NAB said the deal would require equity of about A$1.2 billion, as it would pay cash for the net assets of Citi's book plus a A$250 million premium.
""The market is likely to initially question the strategic rationale of the transaction given a mostly unsecured lending business in a segment of the market that has been in recent decline even though NAB is highlighting the increased scale from payments data,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Jarrod Martin said. 
NAB shares were 0.33% higher, while the broader market was largely unchanged. Alongside 
McEwan told analysts on a call that he expected credit card usage would fully recover once Australia's borders reopen and that as part of the deal NAB would also get Citi's new buy now, pay later product. The BNPL offering, called Spot, was unveiled earlier in the month but has not been launched. 
The deal comes after U.S. lending giant Citi in April said it would exit its 13 overseas consumer operations, including Australia, under an overhaul by new boss Jane Fraser to boost profitability. 
""As this transaction shows, we are moving forward with urgency as we refresh our strategy,"" Fraser said in a statement.
""We will use the capital generated to invest in our strategic priorities, as well as to continue to return capital to our shareholders."" 
Citi's institutional business and underlying technology or platforms are not part of the deal, which is expected to close by March 2022, subject to the regulatory approvals.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it would look ""extremely closely"" at ""any further consolidation involving large players in the banking sector"".
""In reviewing NAB's proposed acquisition... we will be carefully considering credit cards, including while label credit cards, among other areas of overlap,"" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. 
NAB will spend A$165 million in building an unsecured lending platform that will replace ""old"" systems, and in which Citi's unsecured loans will be integrated with its own, it said. Total acquisition and integration costs will add up to A$375 million.

The Melbourne-based bank, Australia's third-largest, said it would enter talks with Citi's white label clients, such as PayPal, Qantas, and Virgin Money (LON:VM), but cautioned that all of them may not move across. NAB is due to provide a third-quarter trading update on Thursday.

Investing.com --  Alibaba  ADR (NYSE:BABA) traded weaker by 1% in Monday’s premarket as China’s state media blasted the company for its handling of a sexual assault case involving a manager and an employee.
On Saturday, a female employee posted an 11-page account on Alibaba's intranet saying her manager and a client sexually assaulted her, according to Reuters. She also alleged that her superiors and human resources had not taken the matter seriously in the five days since she reported it.
The manager, at grocery delivery unit City Retail, said he was involved in ""intimate acts"" when the employee was inebriated and ""has been fired and will never be rehired,"" Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said in an intranet memo, according to Reuters.
""Alibaba could not offer an answer that satisfies public opinion for this ham-handed inaction,"" said an editorial in Global Times published by the state-run People's Daily.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Flipkart must face antitrust investigations ordered against them in India, the country's Supreme Court ruled on Monday, in a blow to the leading e-commerce giants which had urged judges to quash the inquiries.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) ordered the investigation against the companies last year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-antitrust-ecommerce/india-orders-antitrust-probe-of-amazon-walmarts-flipkart-idUSKBN1ZC1BO for allegedly promoting select sellers on their e-commerce platforms and using business practices that stifle competition. 
The companies deny any wrongdoing and mounted legal challenges in lower courts https://www.reuters.com/technology/india-court-quashes-amazon-flipkart-plea-against-antitrust-probe-2021-07-23 and at the Supreme Court against the investigation, saying the CCI did not have enough evidence to pursue the matter.
A three-judge Supreme Court bench, led by Chief Justice N.V. Ramana, said companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Flipkart should volunteer for such investigations. 
""We expect organisations like Amazon and Flipkart, big organisations, they have to volunteer for inquiry and transparency. We expect that and you don’t even want (an) inquiry,"" Justice Ramana told the court.
""You have to submit and an inquiry has to be conducted.""
Amazon in a statement said it complies with all laws and ""will extend full cooperation to the CCI investigation"". Flipkart too said it complies with Indian laws and will cooperate with investigators.
Amazon and Flipkart are leading players in an e-retail market India forecasts will be worth $200 billion by 2026. The decision is a major setback for both companies as the Supreme Court appeal was seen as the last legal recourse to block the CCI pressing on with its investigation. 
In the current antitrust case, filed by trader group Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, the two companies face allegations of exclusive launches of mobile phones, promotion of select sellers on their websites and deep discounting practices that drive out competition.
Amazon and Flipkart had also asked the Supreme Court to put on hold the CCI's recent request for information in which they were asked 32 questions - including details of top 100 sellers and top-selling products. The companies argue such queries relate to ""sensitive"" business information.
Justice Ramana said on Monday the companies will have four more weeks to answer those queries. 
In February, a Reuters investigation https://reut.rs/3xyz8er based on Amazon documents showed it had given preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers. The CCI has said the Reuters story corroborated evidence https://reut.rs/3eTV2CX it had received against the company. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing.

The companies are also grappling with the prospect of tougher e-commerce regulations and investigations by the country's financial-crime agency for alleged violation of foreign investment laws.
In another legal challenge, the Supreme Court last week handed Amazon a victory https://reut.rs/37u8FnK by blocking its partner Future Group from selling $3.4 billion in retail assets to rival Reliance Industries. The CCI though has accused Amazon of concealing facts when it sought approval for a 2019 deal with the Future unit that has sparked the legal dispute, Reuters has reported https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-india-watchdog-accuses-amazon-concealing-facts-deal-future-group-unit-2021-07-22. Amazon has said it is confident of addressing those concerns.

BEIJING (Reuters) -France's  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY) said on Monday it is looking to revive business in China by forming a hybrid vehicle joint venture with Geely Holding Group, a year after it ended its previous operation in the world's largest car market.
The two companies have signed a framework agreement to set up the joint venture, which would make and sell Renault-branded petrol-electric hybrid cars in China using Geely's technologies, supply chains and manufacturing facilities while Renault (PA:RENA) would focus on sales and marketing.
Reuters reported the plan earlier on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.
As part of the partnership, the two automakers also agreed to explore a joint localisation of Geely's Lynk & Co-brand hybrid vehicles in South Korea where Renault has been manufacturing and selling cars for more than two decades.
The venture would focus on China and South Korea initially but would likely to be expanded to cover fast-growing Asian markets.
Geely and Renault are also looking at developing full electric battery cars for the venture, one source familiar with the matter said.
The new venture is modeled on an EV-focused venture Geely set up in 2019 with Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), which plans to manufacture in China and sell Smart-brand EVs based on Geely technology using Daimler's global sales network.
The Geely-Renault venture, however, would be completely separate from Geely's venture with Daimler.
For Geely, China's biggest local automaker by sales, the newest new joint venture would strengthen its strategy to use partnerships with other automakers to share technologies, supply chains and manufacturing, which reduces development costs of EV and other future mobility technology.
For Renault, the partnership would help the French automaker rebuild its presence in China after it ended a joint venture with Dongfeng Motor Group in 2020.
Renault and Geely would make the cars ""in Geely's existing factories"" with an aim to eventually export the vehicles, one document read. However, one source said they were unlikely to immediately disclose which plants production would take place at.
The proposed Renault-Geely joint venture could be controlled by Geely, one of the sources said, in contrast to Geely's Smart joint venture with Daimler, in which both companies have equal share.
Renault and its global alliance partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co had the same Chinese partner Dongfeng, before the Renault-Dongfeng joint venture was dissolved.
Renault and Nissan also have long designed, produced and marketed cars jointly that share platforms and other vehicle components to reduce manufacturing and other costs. 
It was not immediately clear how Renault's new partnership with Geely would impact the Renault-Nissan alliance.

Two Nissan management leaders told Reuters they were unaware Renault was in negotiations with Geely. They said Nissan could possibly benefit if it tapped into Geely's supply chains but it was too early to assess the impact.
Automakers are keen to use petrol-electric hybrid vehicles, which have better fuel efficiency than all-petrol counterparts, to meet increasingly tougher auto regulations around the world. These hybrid vehicles, which drivers cannot charge with electricity directly, are different from plug-in hybrid cars.

Crude oil imports in China, the world’s biggest energy consumer, fell in July and were down sharply from the record levels of June 2020, adding to concerns that recovery in major economies of the world is going to be a long and painful process.
Wall Street banks JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley all cut their China growth forecasts on Monday after the country reported lower than expected import and export numbers, Reuters reported.  
JPMorgan reduced its quarter-on-quarter growth estimate for the country’s third quarter to 2% from 4.3% and trimmed its full-year forecast to 8.9% from 9.1%.
Goldman cut its quarterly estimate to 2.3% from 5.8% and to 8.3% versus 8.6% for the full year. Morgan Stanley lowered its quarterly growth forecast to 1.6%.
On Monday China reported 125 new COVID-19 cases, up from 96 a day earlier, reviving fears that the virus is here to stay even as governments battle vaccine hesitancy while pushing for higher availability of the shots. Infections hit daily records in Malaysia and Thailand.
China's export growth slowed more than expected in July as floods rage in parts of the country. Import growth was also weaker than expected.

Facebook said on Tuesday it had cut off the personal accounts and access of a group of New York University researchers, citing concerns about other users' privacy.
Senators Amy Klobuchar, Mark Warner and Chris Coons pressed Facebook in a letter to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to answer a series of questions. These include how many researchers or journalists have had their accounts disabled this year, why, and how was Facebook changing its terms of service to better accommodate research.
Facebook has said that the research violated rules to protect the privacy of the social media company's users.
Facebook paid a record $5 billion fine in 2019 to resolve allegations it had violated a Federal Trade Commission consent order by misleading users about how much control they had over their personal data.
Separately, the FTC sued Facebook in December for allegedly violating antitrust law. That complaint was dismissed and the agency has an Aug. 19 deadline to refile it.

In the letter, the lawmakers also asked how the NYU researchers' work hurt people's privacy. They referenced a letter from Samuel Levine, the FTC's acting director of consumer protection, which said the NYU research did not violate a consent agreement between the agency and Facebook.
""Does Facebook intend to restore the Ad Observatory researchers' access?"" the lawmakers asked, giving the company until Aug. 20 to reply.

The deal underlines a rapid exit by Australian lenders from areas considered to be outside their core-banking operations, following increased regulatory scrutiny since a 2018 government-backed inquiry. 
Companies including Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY), insurer Suncorp Group Ltd and wealth manager AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Ltd have cut their exposure to insurance in the last five years.
""This transaction is another step in simplifying the bank,"" said Jason Yetton, chief executive officer of Westpac's specialist businesses and group strategy.
For Dai-ichi, the deal provides another avenue to boost its overseas business as Japan grapples with a declining population. It had bought Suncorp's Australian life insurance business for A$640 million in 2018 https://reut.rs/3lM2cfV.
The Japanese company said the deal fits its medium-term plans to increase the group's profit contribution from its overseas life insurance businesses.
Westpac, which has already agreed to sell its general insurance and New Zealand life insurance arms, said the deal would add about 12 basis points to its level 2 common equity tier 1 capital ratio.
The lender expects an after-tax accounting loss of about A$1.3 billion on the sale, with about A$300 million to be realised in its fiscal 2021 results.
The sale is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022.

The lender also said it signed an exclusive 20-year deal with Dai-ichi's local unit, which insures more than 4.5 million Australians, to sell life insurance products to Westpac's customers.

508,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 01:36AM ET</span>",How sustainable are sovereign wealth funds?,"By Tom Arnold and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Risks don't come much longer term than climate change, so you might expect sovereign wealth funds to be all over it, as investment giants with decades in their sights.
Yet the world's biggest SWFs are making only patchy progress in adapting investment plans to account for environmental, social and governance factors, according to data on energy investments, an ESG analysis of the equity holdings of some of the funds, plus a survey of the players.
Such data provide snapshots into the complex and often opaque world of sovereign funds, which collectively hold nearly $8 trillion in assets. 
The industry has invested $7.2 billion in renewable energy since 2015, for example, less than a third of the amount poured into oil and gas, data from the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) showed.
The Antipodean funds, which publicly disclose their investments, scored highly in the ESG analysis of major corporate holdings. New Zealand also said it planned to cut the emissions intensity of its overall portfolio by 40% by 2025, referring to a measure of emissions proportional to revenue.
Middle Eastern funds face a tougher task to decarbonise their portfolios, given their economies' longstanding reliance on fossil fuels. They did not disclose climate targets, although most are planning to beef up their ESG focus.
The Reuters survey showed a divergence in funds' broad approaches to companies with poor ESG ratings; Hong Kong Monetary Authority's fund (HKMA) and Singapore's GIC prefer to try to drive change from within, while the Antipodean and Norwegian funds are more prepared to twin that approach with excluding stocks.
Any failure or lag in future-proofing portfolios could threaten the long-term performance of SWFs, established to safeguard wealth for generations to come and to buttress state revenues, according to many investment specialists.
And given the funds are some of the world's biggest investors, their ESG positions can affect how quickly corporations put their businesses on a more sustainable footing, the experts say.
""Sovereign wealth funds are the long-term investment capital of the world, so how they respond to climate change and ESG is the purest case study of how a long-term asset allocator should and does think about these issues, or doesn't,"" said Aniket Shah, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF)' global head of ESG and sustainability research.
""They are the one investor where the term of investment and the term of the scale of these issues are aligned with one another, more than with pension funds.""
OIL AND GAS DEALS 
There is broad acknowledgement of the need to change.
Several funds, including those from Abu Dhabi, New Zealand, Norway, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, have signed up to the One Planet Initiative, a drive to integrate climate risks into the management of large pools of capital. 
More than 30 funds are also members of the Santiago Principles, a voluntary set of goals aimed at promoting good governance, accountability, transparency and prudence.
Yet progress has been halting for these investment behemoths, who play a role in setting the pace of the global shift away from carbon.
The SWF industry has spent more on oil and gas deals than renewable energy in almost every year since 2015, including 2021 so far, according to the data compiled for Reuters by the IFSWF wealth fund industry group. The one exception was 2016.
In terms of the number of deals over those years, there was a more even split between the two sectors.
Annual investments in renewables are rising, though, while Enrico Soddu, IFSWF's head of data and analytics, said some oil and gas investments were to help in the transition away from carbon and included pipelines, which could be adapted to carry hydrogen in future.
That said, renewable energy has accounted for less than a quarter of SWFs' overall number of infrastructure investment deals over the past decade, lagging the 29% of public pension funds, according to Preqin data.

AUSTRALIA SHINES
Comparing funds' progress on ESG can be difficult, because they vary in history, geography and size. Many invest in areas like infrastructure, real estate and private equity, where progress can be trickier to gauge, while some are more open than others about their holdings. 
A snapshot of the top-25 equities of those funds that publicly disclose their holdings - Australia, New Zealand and Norway - showed Australia's $166 billion Future Fund had the highest-scoring portfolio, according to ESG scores calculated using data from three of the top raters: MSCI, Sustainalytics and Refinitiv.
It was followed by New Zealand's $41 billion NZ Super Fund and Norway's $1.3 trillion Norges Bank Investment Management, the world's largest fund.
""The New Zealand and Australia funds are more ahead than anybody else in terms of integration of climate risk but also ESG in general,"" said Massimiliano Castelli, UBS's head of strategy & advice, global sovereign markets.
SWFs in general have been ""a little bit too late"" in embracing ESG, he added. 
Graphic: SWF ESG equity scores https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xmpjogwznvr/Capture.PNG 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU VOTE?
Wealth funds say climate risk is important, according to the Reuters survey of 13 SWF, though they gave varied responses about their ESG strategies and any targets. 
New Zealand is one of the few funds to disclose ESG targets. Norway's fund said it pushed the companies it invested in to make disclosures about non-financial data, such as greenhouse gas emissions or water consumption. 
The $649 billion Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) said it incorporated climate risks as part of investment planning, as did Australia's Future Fund, which said ESG factors ""can be material to investment performance"". 
Singapore's $417 billion Temasek Holdings said it assessed the emissions profile of target companies, while the $581 billion HKMA said it was studying metrics and targets to assist its management of climate risk. 
How often the funds voted at shareholder meetings - considered by sustainable investment experts to be an element of good ESG governance - also differed.
New Zealand's SWF said it voted at around 99% of annual general meetings (AGMs) of the companies in its portfolio, while Norway's voting record was 98%. The Australian fund said it exercised all eligible voting rights in listed companies.
Temasek and the $453 billion GIC didn't disclose details about how often they voted. HKMA said its external managers exercised voting rights.
Saudi Arabia's $430 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF), the $534 billion Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), the $295 billion Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and the $302 billion Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD) did not respond to the questions. 
The Chinese funds contacted - the $1 trillion China Investment Corporation (CIC) and the $372 billion National Council for Social Security Fund - also did not respond. 
RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS
There are indications that funds that have led the way on ESG have also tended to enjoy better overall financial returns in recent years, according to an analysis by industry research firm Global SWF. 
Between 2015 and 2020, New Zealand's fund had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.5%, Australia's Future Fund had 8% and Norway's 7.7%, Global SWF calculated, based on their financial results. 
That was ahead of estimates for the likes of the PIF, GIC ADIA, but below those for many public pension funds, which are widely considered more advanced on ESG than wealth funds. 
The PIF, ADIA and GIC declined to comment on Global SWF's estimates. 

The precise role of ESG in performance is not clear, though, as other factors are at play, such as investment mandate and asset allocation. Yet Diego López, Global SWF's managing director, is sure it's a significant influence.
""There's definitely a relationship between ESG effort and financial returns,"" he said. ""Those funds that do not look after proper governance and sustainability do not generally perform very well.""

President Joko Widodo has vowed to overcome lingering hurdles such as red tape, rigid labour laws and poor infrastructure in his second term to compete with neighbours such as Vietnam and Thailand to attract foreign investment. 
The ""Online Single Submission"" oss.go.id website will process investment proposals based on the level of risk, with lower risk investments needing only to register and medium ones to meet national standards.
""We want our investment climate to become more conducive ... to increase investors' confidence, to create jobs and become a solution to the problem of rising unemployment because of the pandemic,"" Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, said during the website's launch. 
The website is part of a controversial Job Creation law https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-economy-law-idUSKBN26Q1TM, which passed last year despite protests from unions, environmentalists and other critics who view it as too pro-business.
Jokowi has tried to digitalize investment applications before, but it could still take months if not years to process a proposal in certain sectors. 
The website gives Jokowi's new investment ministry greater authority so that it can intervene when local authorities take too long to respond, officials say.
Indonesia pulled out of economic recession in the second quarter with 7.07% gross domestic product growth and investment up 7.54%, but analysts warn the recovery faces a setback due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc has delayed the $1 billion Hong Kong initial public offering of its music streaming service Cloud Village because of volatile trading in China's major tech companies, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The people could not be named as the information was not yet made public.
A NetEase spokesperson said the company had no immediate response.
The IPO was approved by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s listing committee, according to filings lodged with the exchange, and preliminary meetings were held with potential investors last week. 
The deal was due to launch this week but was put on hold on Monday, the sources said, given the uncertain conditions facing China's tech companies following a regulatory crackdown ordered by Chinese officials. 
NetEase's Hong Kong listed shares lost nearly 14% last week after it was reported China's gaming sector could be next in line for intensified regulatory scrutiny.
The stock is up 4.1% on Monday.
NetEase announced in May it would spin off Cloud Village and retain 62.4% ownership of the streaming business.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning as the latest U.S. jobs report continued to fuel bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin asset tapering sooner than expected.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.06% while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.30% by 9:41 PM ET (1:41 AM GMT). Inflation data released earlier in the day said the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1% year-on-year and the producer price index (PPI) rose 9% year-on-year in July.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.08%.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.14% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.28%
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.
Friday’s U.S. jobs report was better than expected, with non-farm payrolls rising by 943,000 and the unemployment rate declining to 5.4% in July.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose 1.3% on Friday.
With Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan saying on Friday that he would support beginning asset tapering soon, but in a gradual manner, investors now await comments from Fed officials, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, throughout the week.
As the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus continues to spread and inflation remains high, investors now await the U.S. CPI, due on Wednesday, to gauge price pressures ahead of the Fed’s Jackson Hole economic symposium later in the month.

In China, where over 25 million vehicles were sold last year, Renault will use Geely's newly-launched hybrid car system to jointly develop vehicles under the Renault brand, the companies said in a statement. They did not disclose production details for the vehicles.
This is the first move since Weiming Soh, a former senior Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) executive, became Renault's China chief this year. 
Last year, Renault quit its main China joint venture with Dongfeng Motor Group due to poor sales. Currently it is making cars and vans at three tie-ups in China.
In South Korea, where Renault is making cars at Renault Samsung (KS:005930) Motors venture, Renault will explore making cars with Geely's car technologies, they said, adding they will focus on other Asian markets.
Automakers are keen to use petrol-electric hybrid vehicles, which have better fuel efficiency than all-petrol counterparts, to meet increasingly tougher auto regulations around the world. These hybrid vehicles, which drivers cannot charge with electricity directly, are different from plug-in hybrid cars.
China has some of the world's strictest rules regarding the production of greenhouse gas-emitting vehicles, as it battles unhealthy levels of air pollution in its crowded cities. 

Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda have long been developing and making hybrid cars but Chinese automakers including Geely, owner of Volvo Cars and has a 9.7% stake in  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), and Great Wall are following and rolled out their hybrid car technologies in the past year.
Last year, Geely and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) said China could emerge as a manufacturing and export hub for hybrid powertrains jointly developed for Volvo and Mercedes-Benz cars.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -Informal talks are taking place to deal with the fall-out from two rulings by India's Supreme Court that threaten the repayment of loans totalling nearly 500 billion rupees ($6.73 billion) to some of India's largest banks, bankers close to the matter say.
Any failure to recoup the money adds to stress in the banking sector, which is already dealing with an increased level of bad loans and reduced profits because of the impact of the pandemic.
Last week, India's Supreme Court effectively blocked Future Group's $3.4 billion sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries, jeopardising nearly $2.69 billion the retail conglomerate owes to Indian banks.
That ruling was delivered days after the Supreme Court rejected a petition to allow telecom companies to approach the Department of Telecommunications to renegotiate outstanding dues in a long-runinng dispute with Indian telecom players.
That raises concerns, bankers say, over whether Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea will repay some 300 billion rupees ($4.04 billion) it owes to Indian banks and billions of dollars more in long-term dues to the government.
FUTURE OF FUTURE?
Two bankers, speaking on condition of anonymity said negotiations were taking place to try to limit potentially severe consequences. 
Loans to Future worth nearly 200 billion rupees were restructured earlier this year, giving it more time to come up with repayments due over the next two years, but that was on the premise that Reliance would bail it out, the bankers said.
Future group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Should Future be taken to a bankruptcy court, bankers say they are concerned they will have to take haircuts on the loans of more than 75%. 
""The immediate apprehension is that the restructuring deal will fall through for banks by December,"" said a banker at a public sector bank that has lent money to Future.
Future's leading financial creditors include India's largest lender State Bank of India, along with smaller rivals Bank of Baroda and Bank of India.
Bank of India, the lead bank in consortium lending to Future, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
VODAFONE IDEA
Banks have also started discussing Vodafone's debt to lenders of nearly 300 billion rupees. Top lenders to Vodafone include Yes Bank, IDFC  First Bank  (NASDAQ:FRBA) and IndusInd Bank, as well as other private and state-owned lenders.
Vodafone, Yes Bank, IDFC First Bank and IndusInd did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
""Even though banks have the option of restructuring loans in case the company defaults, it will only make sense if there is clear cash flow visibility, which is not the case right now,"" a senior banker at a public sector bank said on condition of anonymity.

Already, at the end of March, Indian banks had total non-performing assets of 8.34 trillion rupees ($112.48 billion), the government has said. It has yet to provide more updated figures.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2021 06:31PM ET</span>","Wolfsburg, we have a problem: How Volkswagen stalled in China","By Yilei Sun and Tony Munroe
BEIJING (Reuters) - In late December 2019, managers at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) headquarters in Wolfsburg realised they might have a serious problem in China, the company's biggest market and ticket to its electric future.
Its flagship Passat sedan had fared badly in an unofficial safety test carried out by an insurance industry body which simulated a front-on driver's side collision, a test that's been widely used in the United States for around a decade. 
The car was mangled. The crash-test video went viral, attracting millions of views and triggering a social media furore across China, where the German auto king's success is built on its reputation for superior quality and engineering.
Volkswagen was not obliged to do anything - the Passat had passed the Chinese regulator's frontal collision test, the same test that's used in much of Europe, and one that the carmaker and many industry experts believe better reflects driving conditions in China. 
Nonetheless, Wolfsburg acted swiftly, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. Days after the test results were announced, it assembled a team of dozens of engineers and managers to work with SAIC-Volkswagen, the 50/50 joint venture that makes Passats in China, they said.
In early 2020, that team decided that strengthening metal components should be added to the front of all new Passats and a variety of other models made at the Shanghai-based venture, at a cost of about 400 yuan ($62) per vehicle, according to the sources.
That structural modification, details of which have not been previously reported, would amount to tens of millions of dollars for the hundreds of thousands of vehicles that would be affected at the venture a year, the sources said. It was a significant cost for a company that had said it was trying to trim manufacturing costs in China and globally. 
The intervention in the face of online consumer activism underlines the importance of China, the world's biggest car market, and one which Volkswagen is relying on to fund its 35-billion-euro ($42 billion) transition to electric vehicles and make good on its pledge to overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to become global EV leader by 2025. 
Global automakers' expensive renunciation of oil comes at a time when they can no longer count on the dominance they have enjoyed in decades gone by in China, where they're feeling the heat from local gasoline and electric players challenging them on technology and design. 
A Volkswagen spokesperson said it developed products specifically for the Chinese market and that the test failed by the Passat had simulated a head-on collision between two cars, a scenario it said was less likely in China than the United States.
""In China there are central barriers on the highways,"" Volkswagen added. ""In China there aren't normally as many trucks or pickup trucks compared to U.S. traffic scenarios.""
Asked about the 400-yuan modification, the spokesperson said Volkswagen was constantly improving its products according to customer feedback, and to make them safer.
'UTMOST IMPORTANCE FOR VW'S HEALTH'
It's difficult to compare designs of Passats across Volkswagen's markets as they are often fundamentally different vehicles built on different production platforms. 
The new Passat in China was the first model to have such a structural modification when it was rolled out in mid-2020, according to the sources. It passed the insurance industry test that its predecessor had failed. 
But the reputational and financial damage has proved more persistent for Volkswagen, which has been the top-selling foreign carmaker in China and has made largely healthy profits during its over three decades there, the longest of any overseas player. 
Volkswagen's profit per vehicle in the country has fallen from levels of 1,400-1,500 euros around 2015 to around 1,000 euros and even closer to 800 euros in most recent quarters, according to Bernstein analysts who described China as ""of utmost importance for VW's financial health"".
Sales of the Passat, and more broadly at the venture with SAIC Motor, have slumped - something Volkswagen has attributed mainly to the backlash over the failed crash test, as well as product lineup issues and a global chip shortage.
In a sign of the financial pressures facing the industry, one internal memo, seen by Reuters, showed SAIC-Volkswagen's finance team ordered managers to cut costs at workshops by 30% in 2019, versus the year before, when China's car sales dropped for the first time since 1990s. 
Volkswagen declined to comment on the Bernstein profitability figures or the internal memo.
SAIC-Volkswagen's revenue dropped 26% to 174.5 billion yuan last year versus 2019, while profit fell 23% to 31 billion yuan. Sales of the Passat, once one of the best-sellers in its sedan class before the insurance body's test, fell 32% to 145,805 vehicles, according to consultancy LMC Automotive. 
While the COVID-19 pandemic clearly played a big role, the decline at the venture was far steeper than the overall 6.8% fall in Chinese passenger vehicle sales in the same period, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.
Moreover Volkswagen's other main venture in the country, with local automaker FAW - whose products were not involved in the crash test controversy - saw sales rise 1.5%, though VW officials say it gained momentum by introducing SUVs and premium Audi models to the market.
The two joint ventures make up the bulk of Volkswagen's Chinese business, accounting for all its local production. They have historically been close in numbers of vehicles sold, though FAW has taken the lead in recent years. 
There's been no respite for SAIC-Volkswagen in 2021, with sales falling 7.8% in the first six months compared with a year earlier when the pandemic raged. FAW-Volkswagen saw sales grow 23% while overall Chinese passenger car sales jumped about 29%.
CRASH TEST FRACTURED 'A-PILLAR' 
The C-IASI test that the Passat initially failed in 2019 was developed by a Chinese insurance industry body, the CIRI Auto Technology Institute, which was unsatisfied with the standard C-NCAP test conducted by CATARC, a government-backed vehicle testing agency. 
It said many insurers felt that C-NCAP failed to distinguish in enough detail between vehicles in terms of collision safety, and started publishing test results in 2018.
Most foreign car brands received positive results in the C-IASI test, though even those that fared poorly did not receive the online backlash that was aimed at the Passat. 
The C-IASI test subjects 25% of the car's front to a head-on impact. It fractured the Passat driver's side front roof support, known as the A-pillar. 
The standard C-NCAP test hits 40% of the car front, which allows the impact to be better absorbed.
The CIRI and CATARC did not respond to requests for comment.
In the United States, a 25% frontal impact test is used by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), a nonprofit group funded by auto insurers. IIHS tests are widely publicized, and automakers design vehicles to pass them as well as federal crash tests.
Volkswagen's China chief Stephan Woellenstein acknowledged in January that the failed crash test and subsequent online backlash had triggered the decline in Passat and SAIC venture sales. 
Last month, though, he said Volkswagen had fixed the problems revealed by the test, that the ructions of the episode had subsided and the carmaker's Chinese business was recovering.
""We have once again clearly one of the safest cars on the market in this segment,"" Woellenstein told reporters in July. ""We will once again take up the old leadership of the Passat.""
But there is quite some ground to regain in the large family car segment.
A total of 47,480 Passats were sold in the first six months of this year in China, some way behind the 91,110 Toyota Camrys and 89,157 Honda Accords, according to LMC.

The figures from the same period of 2019, before the pandemic struck, show how steeply the Volkswagen model has fallen away of late: 91,400 Passats were sold versus 111,968 Accords and 85,396 Camrys.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Saudi Arabian state oil producer Aramco (SE:2222) reported a near four-fold rise in second-quarter net profit on Sunday, beating expectations and boosted by higher oil prices and a recovery in oil demand.
Aramco said its results were supported by the global easing of COVID-19 restrictions, vaccination campaigns, stimulus measures and accelerating economic activity in key markets.
Aramco joins other oil majors who have reported strong results in recent weeks.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) last month said its net income for the second quarter came in at $4.69 billion, or $1.10 per share, compared with a loss of $1.08 billion, or 26 cents per share, a year ago. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) reported its highest quarterly profit in more than two years, with adjusted earnings at $5.53 billion, compared with earnings of $638 million a year earlier.
Oil prices, boosted by output cuts made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, closed at $70.70 a barrel on Friday and has gained over 35% since the start of the year. [O/R]
""Our second quarter results reflect a strong rebound in worldwide energy demand and we are heading into the second half of 2021 more resilient and more flexible, as the global recovery
gains momentum,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement.
Aramco's net profit rose to 95.47 billion riyals ($25.46 billion) for the quarter to June 30 from 24.62 billion riyals a year earlier.
Analysts had expected a net profit of $23.2 billion, according to the mean estimate from five analysts.
Aramco's CEO told an earnings call that global oil demand was expected to hit 99 million barrels a day by the end of the year and 100 million barrels next year,
Aramco is still working to increase its own capacity to 13 million barrels day, Nasser said, reiterating a plan announced last year.
MAINTAINS DIVIDEND
It declared a dividend of $18.8 billion in the second quarter, in line with its own target, which will be paid in the third quarter.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said late last month they expected Aramco to declare a special dividend because of higher oil prices that had helped boost its free cash flow.
Yousef Husseini, equity research analyst at EFG Hermes, said Aramco may be keeping the extra cash for taking part in the new state-backed Shareek (Partner) initiative, to partner with private sector investments.
""I think the reason they maintained [the dividend] and our rationale was that they are retaining money to invest in future projects and particularly the ""Shareek"" programme,"" he said.
Aramco's capital expenditure was $7.5 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 20% from a year earlier.

A consortium including Washington DC-based EIG Global Energy Partners in June closed a deal to buy 49% of Aramco's pipelines business for $12.4 billion.

The woman's account, published via an eleven-page PDF that went on to circulate widely online, prompted a social media storm on China's Twitter-like microblogging website Weibo (NASDAQ:WB). Police in the city of Jinan said on Sunday morning that they were investigating the incident.
""Alibaba Group has a zero-tolerance policy against sexual misconduct, and ensuring a safe workplace for all our employees is Alibaba's top priority,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.
""We have suspended relevant parties suspected of violating our policies and values, and have established a special internal task force to investigate the issue and support the ongoing police investigation.""
Late on Saturday, a female Alibaba staffer's account of an incident she said took place while on a business trip went viral on Chinese social media, with responses to her account figuring among the top-trending items on Weibo as of Sunday morning.
The woman, who did not reveal her identity, alleged that her boss coerced her into going on a business trip with him to meet one of her team's clients in the city of Jinan, about 900 kilometres (560 miles) from Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou.
According to the woman, on the evening of July 27, the client kissed her. After consuming alcohol, she woke up in a hotel room the following day with her clothes removed and no memory of what happened the evening before.
CCTV footage she obtained from the hotel showed that her boss entered the room four times over the course of the evening, she added.
Upon returning to Hangzhou, she said she reported the incident to human resources and upper management on Aug. 2, asking her boss be fired and for time off. While human resources initially agreed, ultimately they did not follow through, she said.
Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang responded to the uproar late on Saturday on the company's internal message board, according to a person who saw the post, though the company did not officially disclose the material posted on its intranet .
""It is not just Human Resources who should apologize. The related business department managers also hold responsibility and should apologize for their silence and failure to respond in a timely manner,"" Zhang wrote.
""Starting from me, starting from management, starting from human resources, everyone at Alibaba must empathize, reflect, and take action.""
Alibaba announced on its intranet that the woman's supervisor, her contact at human resources, and direct management of those individuals had been placed on suspension, according to the person who saw the posts.

Last month another sex scandal rocked China when Chinese-Canadian pop singer Kris Wu was publicly accused by an 18-year-old Chinese student of inducing her and other girls, some of them under the age of 18, to have intercourse with him.
The incident revived discussions of the #MeToo movement in China, and police in Beijing subsequently arrested Wu, who has denied the allegations.

(Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Saturday said many of its businesses are enjoying strong recoveries from the early depths of the coronavirus pandemic, fueling rebounds in profits and revenue.
The company Buffett has run since 1965 also signaled the billionaire's confidence in its future by repurchasing $6 billion of its own shares in the second quarter, even as its stock price regularly set new highs.
Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's manufacturing, service and retailing businesses suffered last year as economic activity plunged, job losses soared and shoppers stayed home.
But now, Berkshire said its BNSF railroad, namesake auto dealership and housing units are among many businesses seeing ""significant"" recoveries despite supply chain disruptions and higher costs, with earnings and revenue in some instances topping pre-pandemic levels.
Another sign of improvement was Berkshire's decision not to repeat a caution in its previous quarterly results that other operating units still faced adverse effects from the pandemic.
Second-quarter operating profit rose 21% to $6.69 billion, or about $4,424 per Class A share, from $5.51 billion, or about $3,463 per share, a year earlier.
Net income rose 7% to $28.1 billion, or $18,488 per Class A share, bolstered by unrealized gains in Berkshire's $192 billion of investments in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Corp.
Revenue jumped 22% to $69.1 billion. Berkshire also owns such businesses as the Geico auto insurer and See's Candies.
Results were ""pretty strong, reflecting broad economic strength,"" said Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst. He rates Berkshire ""buy"" and raised his earnings forecast through 2022.
Many U.S. companies have improved results as the economy rebounds.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) this month raised its 2021 earnings forecast for Standard & Poor's 500 companies, implying 45% annual growth.
The second quarter was also notable for Buffett's revealing that if he were to step down, Berkshire's next chief executive would be Greg Abel, a vice chairman overseeing Berkshire's non-insurance businesses. Buffett turns 91 on Aug. 30.
NET SELLER
Berkshire's buybacks, including at least $1.7 billion in July when its share count declined further, boosted total share repurchases to about $39 billion since the end of 2019.
Buffett has aggressively repurchased Berkshire shares as high stock market valuations and the growth of special purpose acquisition companies, which take private companies public, make buying whole companies appear too costly.
""It's a killer,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 1, referring to SPACs.
Valuations may have also played a role in Berkshire's selling $1.1 billion more stocks than it bought in the quarter.
The net selling is one reason Berkshire ended June with $144.1 billion of cash and equivalents, despite the buybacks.
Berkshire's share price is up 23.7% in 2021, topping the S&P 500's 18.1% gain, after trailing the index significantly in 2019 and 2020.
""It's very clear they're having difficulty deploying capital in public markets,"" Shanahan said. ""Given the valuation of the stock, we should expect Berkshire's buybacks to be the preferred source of capital deployment.""
BNSF's profit surged 34% to $1.52 billion, as retailers replenished inventories and demand swelled for building products, grain and coal.
First-half vehicle sales grew 30% at the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive dealerships.
Homebuying also rebounded, boosting quarterly reported profit 43% at Clayton Homes mobile homes and 129% at Berkshire's namesake real estate brokerage.
The brokerage is part of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, where wind power tax credits helped increase profit 17%.
Some businesses fared less well.

Geico's pretax underwriting profit fell 70% as people drove, and crashed, more often. Rivals including Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL) and Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR) have also reported more accidents.
Berkshire also said revenue fell 9% at Precision Castparts, the aircraft and industrial parts maker it wrote down by $9.8 billion in 2020 as airlines slashed plane orders. It said a big rebound is not likely soon because customers have enough parts.

Food delivery platforms, in the spotlight due to China's regulatory reforms, have attracted severe criticism on social media for their treatment of delivery workers, most of whom are not covered by basic social and medical insurance.
The meeting included officials from the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, according to a Saturday notice on WeChat by the Ministry of Emergency Management, which also attended. 
Firms should strengthen safety and labour rights protections, and not set performance indicators which harm the health of workers, according to the meeting.
Alibaba Group, its supermarket operator Hema Xiansheng, Dada Nexus Ltd and other firms also joined the meeting and reported on their efforts to improve safety and labour rights. 
Investors believe a major shift is under way in China as the government aggressively pursues reform aimed at cutting cost-of-living pressures at the expense of businesses, roiling stock markets.

A set of reforms announced in July by China's market regulator pushed food delivery platforms in China to guarantee their workers with income above minimum pay, insurance and a relaxation in delivery deadlines.
Investors are worried about the rising cost of employing riders by the platforms, Reuters had previously reported.

Prosecutors had said the ""youth mode"" on WeChat does not comply with laws protecting minors. 
""We will earnestly inspect and check the functions of WeChat Youth Mode, accept user suggestions humbly and sincerely respond to civil public interest litigation,"" the company WeChat team said in a post on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB).
The lawsuit was initiated by Beijing's Haidian District People's Procuratorate against Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Co Ltd, according to a filing posted on JCRB.com, a website run by China’s top prosecutor.
The document did not say how WeChat's ""youth mode"" broke Chinese law. It said it could support other agencies and organisations that intended to bring lawsuits against the Tencent unit and asked them to contact the prosecutor's office within 30 days. 
Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
WeChat's ""youth mode"", when turned on, limits young users' access to some games and functions, such as payments or finding nearby friends.
Chinese authorities have called for minors to be better protected from online dangers, a sentiment echoed by state media this week which criticised the video gaming industry as well as online platforms that help promote celebrity culture.

Tencent on Tuesday announced new curbs on minors' access to its flagship video game, ""Honor of Kings"", after its shares were battered by a state media article that described online games as ""spiritual opium"".
Reuters reported in April, citing people familiar with the matter, that China is preparing a substantial fine for Tencent as part of its sweeping antitrust clampdown on the country's internet giants, but it is likely to be less than the record $2.75 billion penalty imposed on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).

(Reuters) -Norwegian Cruise Line argued to a federal judge on Friday that Florida had banned ""vaccine passports"" to score political points and said the company should be allowed to require proof of COVID-19 shots from passengers when it sails from the state this month.
The cruise line is scheduled for its first post-pandemic cruise from Miami on Aug. 15 and has committed to health authorities that at least 95% of travelers will be vaccinated.
Those plans, however, collided with the Florida ban that was touted by Governor Ron DeSantis, a leading national figure against what he says has been government overreach in fighting the pandemic.
Florida's law forbids businesses, government entities and schools from requiring proof of COVID-19 immunity in return for a service. The law has certain exceptions, such as for healthcare.
A lawyer for Norwegian told U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams that lawmakers never intended to prevent discrimination or protect privacy.
""They want to score political points for one side in a raging debate over whether people should be vaccinated,"" Derek Shaffer said.
The court battle comes as big business and some government entities are responding to the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus with vaccination requirements, prompting legal challenges from vaccine skeptics and civil libertarians.
The judge pressed a lawyer for the state to explain the problem facing Florida consumers that lawmakers were trying to fix. ""We don't want them to carry vaccine documentation to access the economic marketplace,"" said Pete Patterson, the state's lawyer.
SAILING AWAY
Williams, who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama, also questioned why lawmakers didn't ban companies from mandating shots for their workers.""
""Don’t you think it’s odd the statute doesn’t worry about discrimination of the state’s employees who are here in Florida but is focused on patrons of a business, who in this case, are sailing away to other ports of call?"" she said.
Norwegian could be fined up to $5,000 for each passenger denied boarding because they did not provide proof of immunity.
The law essentially codified an executive order signed in April by DeSantis, who is staunchly against COVID-19 restrictions, even as the Republican governor's state has become a hotbed of infections https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-covid-19-cases-hit-six-month-high-over-100000-reuters-tally-2021-08-05 with hospitalizations at record levels.
Norwegian is ramping up its return to cruises, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shut down in March 2020 with its ""No Sail"" order.
On Saturday, Norwegian will make its first post-pandemic sailing from a U.S. port with an Alaska cruise from Seattle. 
In order to sail, Norwegian has attested to the CDC it would confirm passengers have been vaccinated.

""Our policy of 100% vaccinations, coupled with preboarding testing of guests and routine testing of crew, is in place without issue in the nearly 500 ports we sail to and from around the world, except Florida ports,"" said the company's CEO Frank Del Rio said on an earnings call on Friday.
The company said on Friday it is seeing pent-up demand for 2022 cruises.

Companies across the United States have tightened their defenses against the virus, after the Delta variant forced the U.S. public health agency to reverse course and insist on even fully vaccinated individuals wearing masks. 
""We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to follow local government guidance and work closely with leading medical healthcare professionals, gathering their advice and recommendations as we go forward to ensure our buildings are optimized for the safety of our teams,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement on Friday.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 11:56PM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors wary on Washington, balancing debt ceiling and infrastructure bill","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The economic boost from an expected $1 trillion infrastructure bill working its way through the U.S. Senate has helped push Wall Street stocks near record levels, but some investors are concerned that the next two months in Washington could be rocky. 
At issue is not only the bipartisan infrastructure bill, but an expected $3.5 trillion in proposed spending in a Democrat-led reconciliation bill. There is also a showdown coming over the debt ceiling, which could lead to a federal government shutdown if a deal is not reached to increase the borrowing limit by October.
Few expect the U.S. government will default on its debt and upend the $22 trillion Treasury market. Still, some analysts say a drawn out debt ceiling fight could increase volatility in a U.S. stock market where valuations have become stretched with prices near record highs. Other worries include a looming unwind of the Federal Reserve’s easy money policies and a resurgence of COVID-19 that threatens to dent growth.
""When I look at Washington I see a lot of risk,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager and equity strategist at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). 
He said he is concerned political posturing around the debt ceiling could escalate ahead of the 2022 Congressional elections, and that the reconciliation bill could boost corporate or individual tax rates, weighing on investor sentiment.
As a result, he is holding cash in anticipation of adding to value or cyclical stocks that may fall during a market sell-off, he said. 
Overall, global fund managers increased their cash positions in July from 3.9% to 4.1% of assets while adding to shares of large technology companies, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). At the same time, options markets indicate that investors see limited gains in the months ahead, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said that she has also been raising cash to reposition for more volatility in the months ahead. 
""We now have less visibility into the second half of the year"" given the emergence of the Delta variant of the coronavirus and the potential for higher taxes as part of a broad reconciliation bill, she said. 
The rising sense of concern comes as investors anticipate possible further details on plans to pull back emergency-level supports of the economy from the Federal Reserve at the Jackson Hole annual conference of central bankers. 
A surprisingly hawkish turn from the Fed in June led to a brief selloff in equities and the fixed income market. 
Investors will get additional insights into the pace of inflation with the release of the consumer price index reading on Wednesday and the producer price index on Thursday. 
Ultra-low interest rates, along with the highest percentage of companies in the S&P 500 beating analyst expectations since at least 1994, have pushed the S&P 500 up 17.2% for the year to date. 
The S&P 500 now trades at 21.7 times its expected earnings over the next 12 months, down slightly from the 24 times expected earnings at the start of the year yet still well above its historical average. 
Senators could vote on the infrastructure bill in the next few days, lawmakers told Reuters.

While passage of the upcoming infrastructure and reconciliation bills will likely bolster the economy over the next several years, short-term concerns over rising taxes and the debt ceiling could weigh on the S&P 500 in the months ahead, said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist for BMO Global Asset Management. 
""There's going to be a lot of details that need to be ironed out that will be closely watched by the markets,"" he said. ""We expect to see a lot of volatility and posturing here over the next few months and we think that it will last until October.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) on Friday finalized a plan effective Oct. 1 to slow down some first-class mail deliveries as part of efforts to cut red ink.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy proposed in March to revise existing one- to three-day service standards to one to five days for first-class mail. USPS said on Friday that 61% of first-class mail will remain at its current standard.
USPS said in a notice published in the Federal Register current standards require it ""to rely heavily on air transportation, using air cargo transportation carriers and commercial passenger air carriers.""
Delivery standards will be slower for about 7% of periodicals.
Airplanes, USPS added, are less reliable than surface transportation and costs much more because of ""weather delays, network congestion, and air traffic control ground stops.""
The ""addition of one or two days to current service standards for first-class mail and periodicals would enable the Postal Service to convey a greater volume of mail within the contiguous United States by surface transportation,"" it said.
While acknowledging ""some uncomfortable changes,"" DeJoy defended the plan earlier on Friday at a board of governors meeting, saying it makes a commitment to deliver to ""every address in the nation, six days a week, and strives for financial sustainability.""
USPS on Friday posted a $3 billion quarterly net loss, with a 1.1% rise in first-class mail deliveries to 12.1 billion pieces. But ""volumes remain lower than pre-pandemic levels and we expect continued secular declines,"" it added.
For the minority of first-class mail affected by the slower delivery window ""the standard would only change by one or two days (with most of such volume experiencing a one-day change),"" USPS said.
USPS added it has been unable to achieve existing ""service performance targets for many years, and that these service failures illustrate the weakness of the current transportation model.""
In June, the attorneys general of 20 states asked the U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission to reject plans to slow down some first-class deliveries, saying allowing that to happen could harm local governments' ability to fulfill essential functions.
DeJoy unveiled a plan in March to cut $160 billion in predicted losses over the next decade with the changes in service standards a key part.
USPS has struggled with poor delivery performance over the past year, facing a huge boost in packages and staffing issues due to the coronavirus pandemic. It said Thursday that through July it delivered 89% of first-class mail on time, up 1.5 percentage points.
Starting Aug. 29, USPS will raise prices of first-class postage stamps to 58 cents from 55 cents. Price hikes are needed because over the past decade, mail volume has declined by 46 billion pieces, or 28%, while single piece first-class mail declined 47%, USPS said.

Congress is considering a plan to provide USPS with $46 billion in financial relief over 10 years, including eliminating a requirement that USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits for 75 years.
The agency has reported net losses of about $90 billion since 2007. One reason is 2006 legislation mandating that it pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree healthcare and pension liabilities, a requirement labor unions have called an unfair burden not shared by other businesses.

(Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 indexes closed at record highs on Friday following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, while investors shrugged off concerns over the Delta variant impacting a nascent economic recovery.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 943,000 jobs last month, a Labor Department report showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 870,000 jobs.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report also showed strong wage gains, as employers competed for scarce workers, and a drop in the unemployment rate to a 16-month low.
""I think that investors are now saying we’ve got renewed confidence in the economic recovery,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “And as a result, (investors) are rotating again into the cyclical, the value stocks, as well as the smaller-cap issues.”
Four of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, with financials posting the biggest daily percentage gain since July 20. The S&P 500 technology sector index fell.
Although the three main indexes gained for the week following a stellar corporate earnings season, sentiment has been hurt by fears of higher inflation resulting in a sudden tapering in monetary policy. For the week ended on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.94%, the Dow added 0.78% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.11%.
Focus now turns to a meeting of Federal Reserve leaders in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this month to discuss policy and decide future stimulus strategy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday rose 144.26 points, or 0.41%, to 35,208.51, the S&P 500 gained 7.42 points, or 0.17%, to 4,436.52 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 59.36 points, or 0.4%, to 14,835.76.
On the earnings front, American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) rose 4.7% after it beat second-quarter profit estimates on Thursday.
Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) Inc tumbled 18.2% after issuing a disappointing forecast for bookings and announcing a potential acquisition worth over half a billion dollars.
 Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) Inc rose 8.0% after raising its net sales forecast for the year. 
Analysts expect second-quarter profit growth of 92.9% for S&P 500 companies, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Of the 427 companies in the index that have reported earnings so far, 87.6% beat analyst expectations, the highest on record. 
In other corporate news, shares of  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) surged 7.9% on Friday after a roller-coaster week in which the online brokerage was among the hottest of so-called meme stocks, adding billions to its value.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.65 billion shares, compared with the 9.63 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.33-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 112 new highs and 80 new lows.

The former U.S. banking regulator and crypto enthusiast is resigning at a time when regulators in Hong Kong, Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy and Thailand have cracked down on Binance due to worries over investor protection. Watchdogs globally also fret that the boom in cryptocurrencies is aiding money laundering and increasing systemic risks.
""Letting you all know that I have resigned as CEO of ⁦⁦@BinanceUS,"" Brooks wrote on Twitter. ""Despite differences over strategic direction, I wish my former colleagues much success. Exciting new things to come!""
Headed by Canadian Changpeng Zhao, Binance offers a wide range of services globally, from crypto spot and derivatives trading to tokenised versions of stocks, as well as its own cryptocurrency, Binance Coin.
""Brian's work for Binance.US has been invaluable and we hope he will continue to be an integral part of the crypto industry’s growth, advocating for regulations that move our industry forward,"" Zhao Tweeted on Friday.
Brooks did not respond to requests for further comment. A spokesperson for Binance declined to comment.
Britain's financial watchdog has barred Binance from carrying out regulated activities in the country. Japan's regulator has said Binance was operating there illegally and Germany's watchdog has warned it risked fines for offering tokens connected to stocks.
In the United States, Binance is also being probed by the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and tax authorities, Bloomberg News has reported.

Responding to regulatory pressure, Binance has curbed some services on cryptocurrency bets, highly leveraged positions and trading with tokens linked to shares, and has pledged to beef up its compliance staffing.
Brooks, who was acting U.S. Comptroller of the Currency from May 2020 to January 2021, joined Binance U.S. as chief executive officer at the beginning of May. Prior to joining the regulator, Brooks had been Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase Global. During his time as acting Comptroller, Brooks led efforts to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins and digital asset custody.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a proposal from stock exchange operator Nasdaq Inc that requires its listed companies to have diverse boards, or explain why they do not. 
The proposal requires that companies have two diverse directors, including one who identifies as female and another as an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+, or explain why they do not. Companies also have to publicly disclose the diversity of their boards.
""These rules will allow investors to gain a better understanding of Nasdaq-listed companies’ approach to board diversity,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a prepared statement. 
Nasdaq said it is looking ""forward to working with our companies to implement this new listing rule and set a new standard for corporate governance.”
Women and minorities have been underrepresented in the top ranks of companies, leading to a recent reckoning on racial and gender diversity in Corporate America. According to data from Equilar, boards in the Russell 3000 are halfway to gender parity. In the Russell 1000, 18.4% of directors are under-represented minorities.
Investor efforts to scrutinize diversity on boards have also been stymied by a lack of disclosure, with many companies not detailing the gender and race or ethnicity of directors. 
Republican lawmakers and some companies criticized Nasdaq's proposal and urged the SEC to reject it, saying it would interfere with boards' responsibilities to shareholders and could impose new costs on companies. 
Advocates for people with disabilities had pushed both Nasdaq and the SEC to include disability in the proposal, but were “rebuffed,” said Ted Kennedy Jr, chairman of the American Association of People With Disabilities (AAPD), in an interview with Reuters.

Nasdaq said in a comment letter that companies could consider and disclose additional diverse attributes such as disability or veteran status. But those attributes would not meet the requirements for a female or person who identifies as an under-represented minority or LGBTQ+.
California and Illinois have laws on board diversity for companies headquartered in their states.

The move comes a little over a month after an Exxon lobbyist said the company supports a carbon tax publicly because the plan to curb climate change would never gain enough political support to be adopted. Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods had condemned the comments.
""After careful consideration, we have decided to suspend ExxonMobil's membership in both the Council and Americans for Carbon Dividends, our advocacy arm,"" CLC CEO Greg Bertelsen said in a statement.
Exxon was a founding member of the group along with ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), BP (NYSE:BP), Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total. 
The CLC's decision marks a u-turn after it supported the oil major in June after the lobbyist's comments. 
Exxon said in a statement the CLC's decision was ""disappointing and counterproductive."" 
""It's more important than ever for organizations to work together to advance meaningful policy solutions to address shared challenges and society's net-zero ambitions,"" it said. 
The company said it would continue to be a part of the Alliance for Market Solutions, an organization that also works to try and reduce carbon pollution. 
The non-profit organization World Resources Institute (WRI), a CLC member, said Exxon was not aligned with the council's push to put a price on carbon as a key response to the climate crisis. 

""We welcome CLC's separation from Exxon,"" the institute's CEO, Ani Dasgupta, said in a note, while calling on companies to support a price on carbon in any future legislation that advances in Congress.

(Reuters) - A North Carolina county imposed a 60-day mining moratorium on Friday, giving officials time to rework local regulations before Piedmont Lithium Inc applies for a necessary zoning variance.
Commissioners in Gaston County, west of Charlotte, unanimously approved a resolution that says the company ""cannot be trusted without adequate local controls to protect the health, safety and welfare"" of citizens.
Piedmont representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. The company's shares fell 1.3% in after-hours trading.
If developed, the mine would become one of the largest U.S. sources of lithium for electric vehicle batteries. But officials have worried it could taint groundwater supplies and cause light and noise pollution, among other concerns.
Piedmont told an investment conference this week it expects state approval by mid-2022. County approval would be the next step.
Piedmont has said it intends to engage in blasting - common for open-pit mines - multiple times per day. That has fueled concerns the company could blast during overnight hours, potentially affecting roughly 500 homes near the mine site.
""It is abundantly clear that a mine of this size ... was never anticipated in your development regulations,"" Tom Terrell, an attorney the county commissioners hired to advise them on the Piedmont project, said at the 15-minute Friday meeting.
Piedmont has heavily promoted its mine to Wall Street for years, including hiring Academy Award-winning actor Morgan Freeman to narrate a nearly 3-minute promotional video. 

The company last autumn signed a deal to supply Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc with lithium sourced from North Carolina, sending its stock up tenfold, though the timeline to begin supply was pushed back indefinitely earlier this week.
Piedmont, though, only first approached county commissioners last month about its project. The delay has strained relations with the six-member board.

(Reuters) -United Airlines Inc on Friday became the first U.S. airline to require COVID-19 vaccinations for all domestic employees, joining a swelling list of companies mandating jabs for workers as coronavirus cases rise. 
Employers from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) have mandated vaccines, recent moves that experts said were legal but could raise labor tensions in unionized workplaces. 
On Friday evening, Frontier Airlines said all direct employees would need to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 1, 2021 or provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test on a regular basis. 
Earlier in the day, United, the No. 3 U.S. carrier by revenues in 2019 according to government data, said its 67,000 U.S. employees would need to show proof of inoculation for a vaccine fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
Such approval is expected this fall..
""The facts are crystal clear: Everyone is safer when everyone is vaccinated,"" United Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) and President Brett Hart said in a letter to employees. 
Kirby and Hart said they expected some employees would disagree with the decision, although 90% of the carrier's pilots and 80% of flight attendants are already vaccinated.
Eric Feldman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, said mandates like the one United announced are on ""strong legal footing."" 
The mandate comes as concerns over the variant reverberate through the U.S. airline industry, which is rebounding from a slowdown in travel last year due to the virus. 
On Thursday, Frontier lowered its third-quarter forecast and warned the Delta variant was hurting demand. 
Health officials have called for reinstating indoor mask mandates for most vaccinated Americans and some companies are delaying return-to-office timetables.
Unions from several industries, including ones representing pilots from American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group and United, want any vaccine mandate to be worked out through collective bargaining.
Paul Clark, a professor of labor and employment relations at Penn State, said he believes unions want to avoid any precedent of employers taking decisions alone on working conditions.
""If you allow an employer to make a unilateral decision in this area it erodes their bargaining rights,"" Clark said. ""What are they going to make a unilateral decision about next time?""
The Association of Flight Attendants, the union representing United flight attendants, backed the move. 
""There is now too much at risk to not ensure the safety and well-being of United Flight Attendants,"" the union said in a statement. 

United, like rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), was already requiring the vaccine for new employees and had encouraged current employees to voluntarily take the vaccine through incentives like bonuses or vacation time.
Some other major industries like U.S. automakers have reinstated mask requirements but declined to mandate vaccines for employees.

(Reuters) -Shares of  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) tumbled on Thursday, snapping a four-day winning streak, after the newly public online brokerage said early investors may sell nearly 98 million shares.
Robinhood’s shares finished down 27.6% at $50.97 a day after they jumped more than 50%. The company went public on July 29 at $38, with its shares initially falling below the public offering price before galloping higher. 
In a regulatory filing https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-21-015656 submitted Thursday the company registered for the sale of up to 97.9 million of shares by early shareholders and noted that the company will not receive any of the proceeds. The filing angered some retail investors, who groused in online forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets.
The potential future share sales were outlined in the company's IPO prospectus https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021015076/robinhood424.htm#ib5a32e8afc3b422193a2f2891a49e0c9_895 filed in early July. 
But still, the filing may have prompted some traders to take profits after the stock’s blistering four-day run, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""Whether it's existing shareholders being able to sell is new news or not, it appears to be news to the people who pushed its stock up to $85 on Wednesday,"" he said. 
Robinhood has become a focus of retail traders, joining the ranks of other so-called ""meme stocks"", a term applied to GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Corp and other companies whose shares have experienced wild trading this year, spurred in part by individual investors coordinating online. 
On Thursday, shares of Robinhood were the most traded among clients of Fidelity’s online brokerage, with buys outpacing sales. Robinhood also topped the list of the most mentioned stocks on Reddit's WallStreetBets for a second straight day, according to sentiment tracker SwaggyStocks. 
Buying from retail investors has ramped up in recent days, and may be an important factor in propelling the stock higher, analysts at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research said in a report.
Robinhood’s shares have seen $100 million in retail purchases this week, Vanda Research said in a note Thursday morning. By comparison, shares of video game retailer GameStop saw $352 million worth of buying during the stock’s January rally, when they rose by more than 1,600%, and $600 million for AMC, when the stock rose more than 500% in a rally later in the year. 
“If retail investors start withdrawing money from tired meme stocks to buy HOOD, there is still room for the move to continue,” Vanda’s analysts wrote.

Wednesday also marked the first day that investors could trade options on Robinhood, giving them another way to bet on the stock. Options trading by retail investors has helped fuel big moves in shares of GameStop, AMC and other stocks this year. 
Robinhood's options market debut drew trading volume of about 323,000 contracts on Wednesday - making it the second most heavily traded options market debut in history after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), according to Trade Alert.

(Reuters) - Top cannabis-focused website Leafly is in talks to merge with blank-check company Merida Merger Corp I in a deal that would value the combined company at more than $530 million, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The blank-check firm is owned by Merida Capital Holdings, one of the biggest backers of Leafly, whose site visits have seen a meteoric rise thanks to easing regulations in the United States and rising weed use.
A deal could be announced as soon as next week, the source said, cautioning that talks could still fall apart.
Following the merger, Merida will take at least one seat on the combined company's board, while Leafly's team will continue to be led by Chief Executive Yoko Miyashita, the sources said, declining to be named as talks were still confidential.
Leafly and Merida did not immediately respond to a comment.
The company plans use the proceeds from the deal partly to invest more into its east coast business, the sources said.
Founded in 2010, Leafly was owned by cannabis-focused private equity group Privateer Holdings between 2012 and 2019. 
The company offers consumers ways to find weed stores to buy the cannabis strains they want, runs a pickup and delivery service and posts reviews on different cannabis products.
More than half of all North American cannabis dispensaries use Leafly's platform for e-commerce, advertising and other services.
Prospects of federal legalization and pandemic-led lockdowns have pushed up Leafly's site visits to more than 220 million last year, up 12% from 2019, making it the world's most visited website on weeds. 
(For graphic on Marijuana Legalization by State - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-CANNABIS/zgvomwdqxvd/chart.png) 
The deal, if completed, would be the latest in a nascent sector that has caught the blank-check frenzy. Rival Weedmaps' parent company struck a blank-check deal in December to list on the Nasdaq.
Leafly intends to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol 'LFLY', one of the people said.

Blank-check firms are publicly traded companies that use the funds from their initial public offerings to buy private firms, taking them public in the process.
Billionaire William ""Beau"" Wrigley Jr's Parallel and Jay-Z backed Californian pot producer TPCO Holdings have also struck similar deals to list their shares.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is examining what authority businesses have to mandate vaccines, a top U.S. official told Reuters on Friday, as it considers what more steps can be done to halt the spread of COVID-19.
""We are looking at that just to see how far employers can go when it comes to vaccines and asking their employees to be vaccinated,"" U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told Reuters. ""It's on the radar."" 
United Airlines Inc on Friday joined companies ranging from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) that are mandating COVID-19 vaccines.
While the shots are widely available in the country, some Americans have opted not to get them. Meanwhile, the fast-spreading Delta variant has threatened to undo the country's economic and public health gains.
But companies have wrestled with the extent of their authority to require shots.
Among the concerns is the possibility that companies will be exposed to discrimination lawsuits as they call staff back to their desks after 18 months of pandemic-induced work from home.
For his part, President Joe Biden has already endorsed such moves. ""I will have their backs and the backs of other private and public sector leaders if they take such steps,"" he said on Tuesday.
Still, the federal government, which is the country's largest employer, has stopped short of such steps. They have required unvaccinated employees to submit to increased testing.
The administration has also been in early policy discussions about a ""range of options"" to ""continue to mount a wartime response against the virus,"" press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. Those options could include restricting federal funds, such as Medicare money, from nursing homes and long-term care facilities to spur vaccination.

According to the preliminary results of an ongoing pulse survey of more than 200 American employers launched on July 19 by consultants Mercer, 14% now require staff to be vaccinated in order to work at a company site.
There have been around 2,950 COVID-19-related employment lawsuits in the United States since the start of the pandemic, ranging from disputes over remote working to workplace safety and discrimination, the law firm Fisher Phillips said.

Industry leaders Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Flower Foods (FLO), and Group1 Automotive (GPI) with stable dividend payouts could be solid additions to one’s retirement portfolio.The Fed's continued loose monetary policy has affected retirees relying on periodic interest payouts on fixed-income instruments to sustain their livelihood. The third installment of the Economic Impact Payments authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 distributed stimulus checks to eligible retirees. However, with the government currently focused on revamping the economy through infrastructure investments following disappointing second-quarter GDP results, it is unlikely that retirees will get any further stimulus assistance in the near term.
Equities have historically outperformed the bond and fixed income securities. For example, stocks have returned 9.6% annually since the Great Depression in 1929, 40% higher than bonds, which have returned 5.6% annually over this period. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts expect the benchmark S&P 500 index to generate 6% median annualized returns over the next 10 years, with a 90% probability of outperforming bonds through 2030. Moreover, 25% of the total shareholder returns are expected to come from dividends.
Given this backdrop, large-cap companies Walmart Inc. (WMT), Flower Foods, Inc. (FLO), and Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:GPI), which possess solid fundamentals and pay stable dividends, could be wise retirement investments.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Dow closed at record highs Friday, riding a wave of optimism over the recovery after data showed the economy created more jobs than expected last month.
The S&P 500 rose 0.2% and had hit a record intraday high of 4,436.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4%, or 144 points, to remain close to its all-time high of 35,208.51. The Nasdaq was down 0.40%.
The U.S. economy created 943,000 jobs in July, above forecasts for a gain of 870,000, while  the unemployment rate fell to 5.4% from 5.9%.
Average hourly earnings rose to 4% to from 3.7%  as employers were forced to hike wages to attract new workers amid dearth in labor supply. The trend of rising wages is expected to continue, and could keep inflation higher for longer. 
”Bottom line, this was a solid employment report which showed the most significant improvement in the labor market in 9 months,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. 
The stronger jobs report supported investor expectations that the Federal Reserve could begin to trim its bond purchases by year-end.
“The timing [for tapering] now rides on the August employment report, which could soften in response to the spread of the Delta variant, but tapering is now pretty much baked into the cake by year-end,” Diane Swonk chief economist at Grant Thornton said in a note. 
U.S. Treasury yields surged following report, with 10-year yields rising to near 1.3%. Rising Treasury yields, an ally of bank stocks, prompted strong gains in Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), and People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT), pushing the overall financial sector higher. 
Higher interest rates boost the return on interest that banks earn from their loan products, or net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
Energy was among the top sector gainers, shrugging off weakness in oil prices amid demand concerns after China implemented restriction to curtail the delta variant of coronavirus. 
Oil prices are facing a weekly loss of around 6%, which would constitute their “most pronounced weekly decline since March,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said. 
Tech stocks fell, however, as rising U.S. Treasury yields weighed on the sector. 
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were in the red.
Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) climbed 2% after the file sharing company reported second-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates. 
DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) raised its revenue outlook for the full year after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for the second quarter. Its shares gained 2%. 
In other news, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) jumped 6% as the company reopened ticket sales for space tourism, with seats starting at $450,000. The company also reported mixed quarterly results as earnings missed, but revenue topped Wall Street estimates."
546,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 04:20PM ET</span>","Global Markets: Wall Street muted on jobs growth as taper, Delta fears weigh","By Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON (Reuters) - A positive jobs report drove U.S. stocks modestly higher Friday, but a parallel rise in Treasury yields signaled a downside: the good news could push the Federal Reserve to curtail its massive stimulus policies faster then expected.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 943,000 in July after rising 938,000 in June, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report, pushing unemployment down to 5.4% and suggesting the economy maintained its strong momentum. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 870,000 jobs.
""It's a number that's hard to say anything but positive things about,"" said Sameer Samana, a market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis. ""Especially with the Delta variant kind of perking up, it would be much more confidence-building for the market to have a very strong economy.""
Still, stock gains were muted. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 144.39 points, or 0.41%, to 35,208.64, the S&P 500 gained 7.44 points, or 0.17%, to 4,436.54 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 59.36 points, or 0.4%, to 14,835.76.
Some investors believe the robust jobs numbers could support the view that the Fed, faced with rising inflation and strong growth, may need to unwind its ultra-easy monetary policies sooner than expected. Such an outcome could push yields higher while denting growth stocks and other areas of the market.
""This good news brings pain for the bond market. The dollar will strengthen and yields will go up and that could cap stocks a bit,"" said Peter Cardillo, an economist with Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose to 1.3019%, a week high after their U.S. close at 1.217% on Thursday. Yields have been under 2.0% since July 2019.
""We expect this to be the start of a sustained move higher in Treasury yields over the rest of the year,"" Mike Bell, a market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in an email. 
Investors will now focus on the details of any taper. The Fed's annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this month is seen as offering clues to the Fed's thinking. There were already hints from policymakers this week that an interest rate increase could come in late 2022 or 2023 given the economic strength of the recovery so far.
Oil prices declined further on Friday, set for their biggest weekly loss since October after falls earlier in the week triggered by rising COVID-19 cases and a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles.
U.S. crude fell 1.46% to $68.08 per barrel and Brent was at $70.49, down 1.12% on the day.
The dollar's value relative to other currencies rose sharply on Friday, as the jobs report bolstered the case for faster U.S. policy tightening. The dollar index was last up about 0.528, or 0.57%, in late afternoon trading. 

The stronger dollar and potential for higher yields hurt gold. Spot prices dropped 2.4% to $1,760.69 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 2.57% to $1,758.70 an ounce.
Bitcoin was up around 5% at $42,953, its highest price since May. Ether, the world's second largest cryptocurrency, rose to around $2927, a 4.3% gain, a day after a major software upgrade to its underlying blockchain.

By Manas Mishra
(Reuters) -COVID-19 infections in a Colorado county with a Delta variant surge this spring were more common among fully vaccinated people than in the state's other counties where it was circulating at lower levels, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released on Friday showed.
The study also found that the Delta variant caused more severe illness. Cases, hospital intensive care unit admissions and deaths were higher in Mesa County, Colorado, than anywhere else in the state, it said.
The CDC recently said in a leaked report it believed the Delta variant was producing more severe illness among the unvaccinated than other versions of coronavirus, citing studies outside the United States.
In Mesa County, the proportion of Delta variant cases more than doubled from 43% for the week ending May 1 to 88% for the week ending June 5. The study looked at data from April 27 to June 6 in the county, which accounted for half of Delta variant cases in the state.
An estimated ""crude efficacy"" of COVID-19 vaccines against preventing symptomatic infection among the fully vaccinated people in Mesa County was 78%, versus 89% for other Colorado counties where the variant was less dominant.
The lower estimates may ""lend support to previous findings that COVID-19 vaccines provide modestly lower protection against symptomatic infection with the Delta variant,"" the study found. 
In another study also published on Friday, CDC data showed that a person infected with COVID-19 who was fully vaccinated is less likely to be reinfected than someone who has had the virus but is unvaccinated.

The analysis of 246 patients in Kentucky showed that state residents with previous COVID-19 infections who were unvaccinated had 2.34 times the odds of reinfection compared to those who were vaccinated and had been infected previously.
""If you have had COVID-19 before, please still get vaccinated,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky in a statement.

Earlier this year, several brands including Swedish fashion chain H&M and sportswear maker  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) as well as BCI became targets of some Chinese internet users after they raised concerns about alleged forced labor in Xinjiang.
Members of the coalition remain torn over how and when to respond to the Chinese attacks, with some wanting BCI to swiftly and forcefully rebut the attacks and others pushing for a slower and more cautious approach, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Members of BCI that promotes sustainable cotton production include Nike, Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), H&M and Japan's Fast Retailing.
The China branch of BCI, however, said in March it had found no signs of forced labor in Xinjiang.
The Journal said BCI deleted from its website a statement about its concerns in Xinjiang four months ago and has not commented since.
BCI declined to comment.

Levi Chief Executive Officer Chip Bergh said in April the brand had not been doing any business in Xinjiang in more than a decade, noting China typically accounts for only about 3% of its total revenue.
Hogue, who joined the Dockers brand owner as the sustainability chief last year, is building the sustainability strategy and team, a Levi spokesperson said on Friday. Levi declined to comment on the reason for his stepping down.

As a result, OPEC and its allies reached a deal last month to increase overall production by 400,000 barrels per day monthly beginning this month.
The rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus continues to worry investors about global oil demand. However, oil prices rose to $71 a barrel yesterday on rising Middle East tensions. Moreover, the International Energy Agency estimates a 1.5 million barrel per day shortfall for the second half of this year, indicating a tight market despite the gradual supply increase by the major oil-producing countries.
Amid this backdrop, it would be wise to bet on quality oil and gas stocks Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR), Cimarex Energy Co. (NYSE:XEC), and National Fuel Gas Company (NYSE:NFG) because of their solid financials and impressive growth estimates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of 14 Republican lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday asked the U.S. Commerce Department to add former Huawei unit Honor Device Co to the government's economic blacklist.
The lawmakers led by Republican Michael McCaul, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, noted in a letter that Honor was divested from Huawei, which was added to the U.S. Entity List in May 2019. Being added to that list bans companies from buying parts and components from U.S. companies or using American technology without U.S. government approval.
The Republican lawmakers argued that Honor was spun off ""in an effort to evade U.S. export control policies meant to keep U.S. technology and software out of the hands of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).""
The letter cited analysts saying that ""selling Honor gave it access to the semiconductor chips and software it relied on and would have presumably been blocked had the divestiture not gone through."" 
A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman said the agency appreciates ""the perspective of these members of Congress."" He noted the department ""is continually reviewing available information to identify potential additions to the Entity List.""
The Chinese Embassy in Washington, Honor and Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Huawei in November 2020 said it was selling its budget brand smartphone unit, Honor, to a consortium of over 30 agents and dealers.
Reuters reported in January the all-cash sale fetched more than 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) and was aimed at keeping the budget brand alive, ""as sanctions slapped on Huawei by the United States had hampered the unit’s supply chain and cut off the company’s access to key hardware like chips and software.""
Washington says Huawei is a national security threat, which Huawei has repeatedly denied.
In January, Honor said it had formed partnerships with chip makers such as  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and launched a new phone.
The lawmakers said ""the same concerns about technology exports to Honor when it was part of Huawei should apply under its current state-backed ownership structure.""

A more than yearlong suspension imposed by U.S. health officials forced cruise operators to raise billions of dollars, with some of them even pledging ships and private islands to stay afloat.
Cruise operators have been sailing from U.S. ports again in recent weeks, with mostly vaccinated guests and crew following lengthy talks with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Norwegian Cruise said cumulative booked position for 2022 was above record levels and at higher prices.
Rival  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group said on Wednesday bookings for 2022 cruises were ""practically back"" to pre-pandemic levels.
Norwegian Cruise expects its monthly cash burn to increase to about $285 million in the third quarter, compared with about $200 million on average during the second quarter, due to cruise restart-related expenses.
Norwegian Cruise, which expects all its 28 ships to restart operations with guests by April next year, said its Norwegian Gem ship will sail from Miami on Aug. 15.
The company on Friday also heads to federal court in a battle that pits its plan for returning to the seas against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's vow to oppose COVID-19 ""vaccine passports"".
As part of Norwegian Cruise's plan to guard against a COVID-19 outbreak, the company will require passengers to prove they have been vaccinated, but banning anyone who refuses to prove their vaccine status will run afoul of Florida's law.

The company's net loss widened to $717.8 million in the second quarter ended June 30, from $715.2 million a year earlier.
Norwegian Cruise's shares were down about 1% at $24 in premarket trading.

The resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States due to the Delta variant and new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that requires fully vaccinated individuals to wear masks, have led companies to change their plans on vaccinations and masking.

(Reuters) -Shares of  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) rallied 10% on Friday after a roller-coaster week that has made the online brokerage among the hottest of so-called ""meme"" stock and added $18 billion to its value. 
Robinhood, whose smartphone trading app has taken off this year along with a frenzy of trading by retail investors on Reddit, was last at $56.20, up almost 50% from the price in its initial public offer last week.
The company plans to announce its quarterly results on Aug. 18, Robinhood said in a press release on Friday. 
Robinhood also said it does not expect that it will be in a position ""to obtain a declaration of effectiveness"" from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would clear the way for certain shareholders to sell their holdings, until after it reports its quarterly results.
The stock stumbled in its first day on Wall Street before lifting off this week and surging as high as $85 on Wednesday, evocative of rallies in GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) that Robinhood trading helped fuel earlier this year. 
At its market capitalization of over $47 billion, Robinhood is more valuable than companies, including Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA).
Retail investors made net purchases of $8 million worth of Robinhood shares on Thursday, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research, even as the stock tumbled 28% after a filing showed more than a dozen early investors could sell their stock over time.
On Friday, Robinhood was by far the most discussed stock on Reddit's wallstreetbets trading forum, with most comments reflecting positive sentiment, according to Swaggystocks.com, which tracks comments on Reddit.

Robinhood was traded more than any other stock on Fidelity's online brokerage, with buy orders outpacing sell orders by about 1.2 to 1, data on Fidelity's website showed on Friday.
Star investor Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation ETF now owns Robinhood shares worth about $275 million after its stake increased by about 24 thousand shares on Thursday, according to data on the fund's website.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Daniel Loeb's hedge fund, Third Point (NYSE:SPNT), told investors on Friday that it made a new bet on upscale home goods retailer RH (NYSE:RH) and is urging management at Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co to do more to unlock the full potential of its streaming service.
Loeb wrote in a letter to investors that was seen by Reuters that he is confident RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, will deliver quick earnings growth and expand abroad under the guidance of Chief Executive Officer Gary Friedman, whom he called a “once-in-a-generation leader.” 
The billionaire investor also urged Disney's management team to take more action to maximize the potential of its streaming platform, suggesting an ""all-you-can eat approach to its direct-to-consumer offering.""
Loeb, who has often been critical of chief executives, praised Disney's leaders for past moves, including suspending the company's dividend in the first half of fiscal 2020.
His investment in Disney, unveiled roughly a year ago, has been paying off, Loeb said, as his optimistic view of Disney's streaming service is being proven correct. The company's stock price has climbed 70% since May as Disney+ streaming now generates over $15 billion in annual revenue from a base of 159 million subscribers.
Yet work lies ahead, the letter suggested. 
“While the progress thus far has been commendable, even more can be done to realize Disney’s full potential in streaming,” Loeb wrote. 
For example the company could offer its various content on a single platform under the Disney+ brand, “where all theatrical content is available day-and-date with no additional fee to subscribers,” he wrote.
Disney's chief executive officer and chief financial officer have impressed Loeb and his team with their ""relentless pursuit of long-term value creation,"" and have ""done what is right for customers."" 

But ""establishing a durable leadership position in the competitive global streaming market will require tough choices, aggressive investment, unwavering focus and consistent innovation,” he wrote.
Third Point gained 15.2% during the first half of 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - The author of a report alleging institutional racism inside HSBC has resigned, citing frustration at its response to some of his criticism and a lack of support from white colleagues, two internal emails seen by Reuters show.
Ian Clarke, who was a salesman in the U.S. Global Liquidity and Cash Management division in New York, resigned on Tuesday in an email sent to around 1,000 staff and senior managers in HSBC's U.S. and British businesses, and seen by Reuters.
HSBC's newly-appointed global head of inclusion attempted to reassure staff over his exit, the other shows.
HSBC said in response to Clarke's resignation that it was committed to improving diversity and inclusion. 
""When colleagues raise concerns we take them seriously and are looking into the issues raised,"" the bank said in a statement issued to Reuters on Friday.
Clarke had sent a 48-page report which he called Project Speak Up to HSBC's senior management in June. This was launched on his own initiative and aimed at quantifying and combating the alleged discrimination he said he had experienced at the bank and heard about from colleagues.
Compiled over a year and based on Clarke's interviews with around 100 staff, it alleged a failure to retain or promote Black and other ethnic minority staff, a lack of such people in senior positions and insufficient policies to address these problems.
HSBC said that it took the report seriously and would implement many of its recommendations.
London-born Clarke, who describes himself as half Jamaican and half white British, said in his resignation letter to Chief Executive Noel Quinn he was pleased with some of the progress.
HSBC has wholly or partly implemented 9 of his 12 recommendations, he said, including creating better support programmes for ethnic minorities and aiming to improve minority representation on key decision-making bodies. 
""And yet regardless, I'm aware of not a single white person in our firm of 226,000 who seized the momentum we have created together to come forward and Speak Up themselves for what's right,"" Clarke said.
Clarke said in his resignation letter he had reported alleged discrimination by several white men whom he declined to name over three years who all remain in their roles, while five Black or darker skinned people had left his team with none added.
That was a microcosm of a failure to improve diversity at HSBC, he said.
Reuters was not able to immediately verify Clarke's assertions. 
His resignation comes as banks face pressure to deliver on pledges to improve diversity after the murder of George Floyd by a U.S. police officer in 2020 sparked global protests.
""We are fully committed to an environment where people speak up when they see something which is wrong ... If we receive reports of racist or discriminatory behaviour we will take action,"" HSBC said. 
OVERLOOKED
HSBC's global head of inclusion Carolanne Minashi emailed the around 1,000 recipients of Clarke's resignation letter the following day, to reiterate HSBC's ambition to 'work at an accelerated pace' to improve diversity.
""Many of you will know that Ian had been in discussions with me and my team, HR and members of senior leadership over the past months,"" Minashi wrote in the email seen by Reuters, which did not address the substance of his allegations.
The bank appreciated his commitment to improving HSBC and wished him the best, she said.
Europe's biggest bank said in July 2020 it aimed to double the number of Black staff in senior roles by 2025, a goal that Clarke's report said did not go far enough given a low base.
Black employees at the bank have said in internal meetings that they have felt overlooked for career opportunities and ""uninspired by the lack of senior role models"", Quinn said in a memo to all staff seen by Reuters in July 2020.
The memo was the result of meetings with Black HSBC staff following the spotlight put on systemic racism in the United States and worldwide following Floyd's murder in May that year.

""We are committed to achieving that target and I see no need to restate it,"" CEO Quinn said on Monday, before Clarke resigned, when asked by Reuters about progress towards the goals. 
Among its British staff, 2.4% have self-identified as Black, but among senior leaders this falls to 0.9%, HSBC told Reuters in February.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Dow remained near record highs Friday, as a better-than-expected monthly jobs report pointed to strength in the underlying economy, and lifted cyclical sectors of the market.
The S&P 500 rose 0.2% and had hit a record intraday high of 4,440.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5%, or 160 points, to remain close to its all-time high of 35,246.79. The Nasdaq was down 0.41%.
The U.S. economy created 943,000 jobs in July, above forecasts for a gain of 870,000, while  the unemployment rate fell to 5.4% from 5.9%.
”Bottom line, this was a solid employment report which showed the most significant improvement in the labor market in 9 months,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. 
The stronger jobs report supported investor expectations that the Federal Reserve could begin to trim its bond purchases by year-end.
“The timing [for tapering] now rides on the August employment report, which could soften in response to the spread of the Delta variant, but tapering is now pretty much baked into the cake by year-end,” Diane Swonk chief economist at Grant Thornton said in a note. 
U.S. Treasury yields surge following report, with 10-year yields rising to near 1.3%. Rising Treasury yields, an ally of bank stocks, prompted strong gains in Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), and People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT), pushing the overall financial sector higher. 
Higher interest rates boost the return on interest that banks earn from their loan products, or net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
Energy was among the top sector gainers, shrugging off weakness in oil prices amid demand concerns after China implemented restriction to curtail the delta variant of coronavirus. 
Oil prices are facing a weekly loss of around 6%, which would constitute their “most pronounced weekly decline since March,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said. 
Tech stocks fell, however, as rising U.S. treasury yields, which dent the attractive of stocks with higher, weighed on the sector. 
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were in the red.
Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) climbed 3% after the file sharing company reported second-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates. 
DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) raised its revenue outlook for the full year after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for the second quarter. Its shares gained 2%. 
In other news, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) jumped 8% as the company reopened ticket sales for space tourism, with seats starting at $450,000. The company also reported mixed quarterly results as earnings missed, but revenue topped Wall Street estimates."

566,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 01:15PM ET</span>",UK's Morrisons agrees to raised $9.3 billion offer from Fortress-led group,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -British supermarket Morrisons has agreed an improved takeover offer worth 6.7 billion pounds ($9.3 billion) from a consortium led by Fortress Investment Group, but wants a rival private equity suitor to be given more time to make a counter bid.
Morrisons said on Friday its board had unanimously recommended Softbank-owned Fortress' raised offer, comprising 270 pence per Morrisons share plus a 2 pence a share special dividend.
However, it later said U.S. private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) had asked for more time to consider a counter offer.
Morrisons and CD&R have asked Britain's Takeover Panel, which regulates takeovers, to extend an Aug. 9 deadline for CD&R to clarify its intentions.
Morrisons has also postponed an Aug. 16 shareholder meeting to vote on the Fortress offer and set a new date of Aug. 27. That means the Takeover Panel is likely to set a new deadline for CD&R of Aug. 20.
Shares in Morrisons closed at 278.8 pence, indicating investors are hoping for a higher offer.
Fortress ""remains committed to becoming the new owner of Morrisons and to being a responsible long-term steward of this great British company through the next stage of its evolution,"" it said.
Morrisons' board had previously agreed a Fortress offer worth 254 pence a share or a total of 6.3 billion pounds on July 3.
However, major Morrisons investors Silchester, M&G and JO Hambro all indicated that offer was too low.
None of those investors had any comment on Fortress' new offer.
CD&R had a 230 pence a share proposal worth 5.52 billion pounds rejected by Morrisons on June 17.
PREMIUM
Fortress' increased offer represents a premium of 52% to Morrisons' closing share price of 178 pence on June 18 - the day before CD&R went public with its proposal. 
For the Fortress offer to pass it needs the support of shareholders representing at least 75% in value of voting investors at the meeting.
Analysts have speculated that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a partnership deal with Morrisons, could still enter the fray.
The Fortress consortium, which also includes Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Koch Real Estate Investments and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, would retain Morrisons' Bradford, northern England, headquarters and its existing management team led by Chief Executive David Potts and execute its existing strategy. Material store sale and leaseback transactions are not planned. 
Morrisons has described the consortium as suitable owners for a business with more than 110,000 staff and a deeply integrated supply chain, that includes its own meat and fish processing sites. 

Morrisons is unique among British supermarkets in making half of the fresh food it sells.

567,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 12:59PM ET</span>","Yelp Soars As It Beats Estimates, Revises Guidance One More Time","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Yelp  stock (NYSE:YELP) jumped 9% Friday as the company’s second-quarter results beat estimates and that helped it raise its annual guidance one more time.
More restaurants advertising and users returning to dining drove the online user review platform’s revenue in the second quarter.
As many multi-location advertisers returned to spend, paying advertising locations reached 528,000, an increase of 150,000 from the second quarter of 2020. Average revenue per location reached a record high. As a result, advertising revenue from services businesses even topped 2019 second quarter levels.
Consumers’ rapid return to restaurants in the second quarter drove a record number of diners seated via Yelp, which was up 70% from the first quarter.
The company grew the percentage of monetized leads of all kinds in its services categories — phone calls, URL clicks and requests — to approximately 25%.
Yelp’s second-quarter net revenue grew 52% year-over-year to $257 million, resulting in a net income of $4 million when analysts expected it to book a loss. Revenue was also higher than estimates.
The company now anticipates full-year net revenue to come between $1.01 billion and $1.03 billion. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the full year is seen in the range of $200 million to $220 million. It had first raised its guidance in May.

“We’re at 3,800 on the S&P 500 for yearend,” Jill Carey Hall said in a Friday interview on Bloomberg TV’s Surveillance. “A lot of the good news has really been priced into the market this year.”
Her forecast would imply a slide of about 14% for the benchmark gauge of American equities from its current levels. Carey Hall spoke before the U.S. Labor Department reported stronger-than-expected growth in job creation, with 943,000 new positions added to the economy in July after upwardly revised increases the prior two months.
The S&P 500 is trading near all-time highs, after almost doubling from the depths of the pandemic, as robust earnings growth and low interest rates fuel investor confidence. That bullish sentiment has pushed a Bank of America gauge that plots levels of strategist optimism to a post-crisis high.
“Multiples are very elevated on the index,” Carey Hall noted. “The sentiment indicators that we track have been growing increasingly bullish and our Wall Street equities sentiment index is very close to a sell signal. I think earnings season suggests that a lot of the good news has been priced in.”
For example, companies that report earnings above analysts’ estimates “just aren’t outperforming very much,” she said. “Outside of last quarter, the last time we saw that happen was around March of 2000.” The S&P 500 lost 10% that year.
Carey Hall recommended cyclical stocks that generally do better as the economy expands, and so-called value shares over growth stocks.
“We still like some of the cyclical areas, that are defensive,” she said. “We’re overweight energy, we’re overweight financials. We still like value over growth. These value stocks are generally cheap and under-owned relative to growth stocks.”
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 underperformed major U.S. benchmarks on Friday.

The move is likely to be seen as the clearest sign yet that China is opening up its capital markets after years of gradual moves and pressure from Washington, especially under previous U.S. President Donald Trump.
""The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has approved the registration of J.P. Morgan International Finance Limited taking 100% ownership of J.P. Morgan Securities (China)... making it the first foreign firm to fully own a securities venture in China,"" JPMorgan said in a statement.
China represented ""one of the largest opportunities in the world,"" said bank Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.
For Beijing the move comes as it simultaneously clamps down on other parts of its financial markets, such as foreign equity listings of its biggest firms and the way they operate more generally at home.

Earlier on Friday, the CSRC gave the nod to Fidelity to set up a China mutual fund unit, while Citi has also received final approval for a China fund custodian business this week. 
In June, the world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock, (BLK.N) became the first to be licensed for a wholly-owned China mutual fund unit.

(Reuters) -European stocks inched up to a record close on Friday, marking their best week since mid-March on a run of strong quarterly earnings and as hopes of a broader rebound drove buying in economy-linked sectors.
The pan-regional STOXX 600 index notched a fifth straight record high to gain 1.8% for the week, ending it at 469.97 points.
Bank stocks were the best performers this week, adding 4.4% as positive earnings reports from majors including HSBC and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) boosted the index.
The sector also rose nearly 2% on Friday, outpacing its regional peers as German bond and U.S. Treasury yields surged on the back of strong payrolls data in the United States. [GVD/EUR] [US/]
Energy stocks were among the top performers this week, advancing 3.6% as strong earnings and expectations of a rebound in economic activity this year drove buying.
""Recent positive business survey data has underlined our view that the trend toward global reopening and recovery remains on track. As a result, we expect cyclical parts of the market to outperform, including energy and financials,"" UBS analysts wrote in a note.
Much stronger-than-expected quarterly results and a flurry of merger activity powered European stocks through lingering concerns about soaring COVID-19 cases globally.
Two-thirds of all STOXX 600 companies have reported so far, and 67% have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv IBES data. That is far above the 51% beat-rate in a typical quarter. 
Data on Friday, however, showed German industrial output unexpectedly fell again in June, suggesting supply chain disruptions from the pandemic were likely to persist for the time being.
Among individual movers, Allianz (DE:ALVG), the continent's largest insurer, rose 2.5% after it posted a better-than-expected jump in second-quarter net profit and provided a rosier outlook for the full year.
French IT consulting group Atos jumped 10.9% to the top of the STOXX 600, after a report said several private equity firms were looking at the company.
 London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) added 5% after it reported a 4.6% rise in revenue for the first half of 2021.

Italian lender Banco BPM jumped 7.3% on swinging to a profit in the second quarter, helped by one-off tax benefits and higher revenues.
Among notable decliners, German meal-kit delivery company HelloFresh fell 2.5% after it lowered its 2021 profitability forecast as a result of higher spending to tap into strong growth.

Italy's No.2 bank said on July 29 it had signed an accord with the Treasury setting guidelines for a potential takeover of MPS, in which Rome has a 64% stake having rescued it in 2017 at a cost to state coffers of 5.4 billion euros ($6.4 billion).
Monte dei Paschi's Tier 2 bonds are facing another turbulent week as investors weigh up the risk that holders may suffer losses as part of any acquisition, Refinitiv's IFR service reported on Friday.
Under ""burden sharing"" rules designed to shield taxpayers from costly bank bailouts, European Union competition authorities demand investors in a failing bank bear costs before the state can step in.
Economy Minister Daniele Franco said this week any deal with UniCredit would take place as a market operation, not a fire sale.
One of the sources, who asked not to be named given the sensitivity of the issue, said that Franco's comment meant the Treasury would not seek authorisation from Brussels for further state aid to clinch the sale. 

However, the strict terms set by UniCredit to enter negotiations over MPS are expected to translate into heavy costs for Italian taxpayers. UniCredit has demanded the deal have no impact on its capital while boosting its earnings per share by at least 10%.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 12:31PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Didi in talks with state-backed Westone to hand over data control-sources,"By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Global Inc is in talks with state-owned information security firm Westone to handle its data management and monitoring activities, sources said, as part of its efforts to placate domestic regulators. 
The largest Chinese ride-hailing group became the target of an investigation by regulators in the country just days after it raised $4.4 billion in an initial public offering in the United States.
The powerful Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) last month launched a data-related cybersecurity investigation into Didi, citing a need to protect national security and the public interest.
Didi is in discussions with Westone Information Industry Inc, which would be the main third-party company to manage its massive data stored domestically as per domestic regulators' guidance, said two people with knowledge of the matter.
The sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
In response to the Reuters report, Didi said in a statement: ""Recent media reports concerning proposals for DiDi to hand over control of data, introduce new major shareholders, and delist, etc. are untrue."" It did not offer further detail. 
Reuters had not on Friday reported the company planned to bring in new shareholders or delist its shares. Didi last week denied a Wall Street Journal report that it was considering going private.
Shenzhen-listed Westone, the CAC, and the State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment after regular Asia business hours on Friday.
Westone, which provides information security services and products, counts state-owned China Electronics Technology Cyber Security Co. Ltd as parent and biggest shareholder - making it a preferred candidate for Beijing, said the people.
Didi has submitted proposals to Chinese regulators in recent weeks to allay their concerns, which included bringing in Westone for managing its data across various business lines, said one of the people.
Shares in Didi were up 4% in New York morning trade on Friday, but were still down about 30% from their IPO price.
Didi collects user location and trip route data, for safety and data analysis, and routinely publishes reports illustrating its ""big data"" analytics, showing, for example, what times people in certain cities finish work, or which employers have the longest work hours.
The company also equips cars with cameras monitoring road conditions, and what is happening in the car, collecting data on 100 billion kilometres of Chinese roads per year. It stores all this Chinese user and roads data on domestic servers. 
SECURITY CONCERNS 
The discussions with Westone come amid Beijing's widening crackdown on private companies over antitrust and data security concerns, which has wiped off billions of dollars from the market value of some home-grown companies in recent sessions. 
Didi, which has about 377 million annual active users and 13 million annual active drivers in China, provides 25 million rides a day in China to users who sign up through an app that uses a phone number and password. 
Bloomberg earlier on Friday reported Didi was considering conceding management of its data to a private third party as part of its efforts to resolve the regulatory probe, without naming the company.
The Westone discussions indicate how Beijing is looking to rein in some major privately-owned companies after years of a more laissez-faire approach, and involve state-backed firms with a view to have firmer control over their operations.
Under the plan being discussed, Westone would be able to access Didi's servers across the country to track the latter's data collection, usage and transfers, said the people. 
It would also use its advanced encryption algorithm to prevent potential data breaches at Didi, said the second person. Encryption is regularly used to protect and securely transfer information online.
The CAC, which started a review into Didi's handling of customer data in the middle of its campaign to list in New York, last month called for Didi to stop accepting new user registrations.
The regulator also said Didi's app ""has serious violations of laws and regulations pertaining to the collection of personal information.""

Bringing in a third party to manage and monitor Didi's data could effectively limit its usage and transfer of onshore data, said the people.
The CAC had also been looking into whether there was a possibility of some of the company's data ending up in the hands of a foreign entity, given Beijing's sensitivity about usage of onshore data, sources have told Reuters.

In the note seen by Reuters, President Jeff Zucker told employees that the company has zero tolerance policy on such instances and required its employees to be vaccinated to come to office or to work on field with other employees.
""Everyone from news, sports and studios who comes in now and going forward must be vaccinated. We have been clear about this for months, so there should be no confusion,"" according to the memo.
Showing proof of vaccination may now become a formal part of the process to enter office, CNN said, as against an honor system earlier. 
Besides, CNN has decided to postpone the Sept. 7 return date in the U.S. to around mid-October due to the increase in COVID-19 cases across the country and has mandated masks in its Los Angeles, Washington DC, and Atlanta workspaces, Zucker said in the note.
It, however, didn't disclose the office location where the incident took place. 

Several companies across the U.S. have changed their plans on vaccinations, masking and return to office due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the country and the announcement of new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that requires fully vaccinated individuals to wear masks.
CNN currently has most of its offices open for employees who want to work there voluntarily, provided they are fully vaccinated.

Rising restrictions and tightening regulations over domestic and international travel across the country have already led to declining travel rates. Given the bleak industry outlook, travel-related stocks such as Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corporation (CCL), Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H), and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) are best avoided now.The seven-day average of COVID-19 cases has reached 95,000 in the U.S., representing a five-fold rise in less than a month. As the Delta variant of the coronavirus is spreading rapidly in various states across the country, the government has once again imposed travel restrictions. Although there has been solid progress on the vaccination front in the country, the rising fears and travel restrictions will likely disrupt the travel industry once again.
Last month, the U.S. government confirmed that existing travel restrictions would not be lifted in the near term. Thus, while the path to recovery for the travel industry was well underway, a significant upsurge in cases around the globe has changed that. Travel stocks, which are highly vulnerable to rising COVID-19 cases, are struggling to remain upbeat compared to other stocks.
Therefore, it is advisable to avoid travel-related stocks such as Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG), Carnival Corporation & plc (CCL), Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H), and Spirit Airlines Inc. (SAVE), that are yet to gain enough strength to survive the industry headwinds.

(Reuters) -Canadian pot producer  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) Corp reported a smaller quarterly adjusted loss on Friday, as it benefited from cost cuts and a rise in cannabis use during the coronavirus pandemic.
People across North America have turned to marijuana for relaxation and entertainment during the months-long isolation caused by COVID-19, lifting sales of pot producers.
The sector has also drawn renewed investor interest as U.S. states legalize pot and hopes rise for federal marijuana reform, prompting Canadian pot producers to consider cross-border expansion plans.
""We continue to look at building out our position in the United States. We're not waiting around on permissibility,"" Canopy Chief Executive David Klein said.
The company's C$2.1 billion ($1.67 billion) of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter are expected to help fuel the expansion, Klein added.
In a bid to turn profitable by this fiscal year, Canopy has also doubled down on its core Canadian market. Earlier in 2021, it bought rival Supreme Cannabis in a deal that made it the owner of four of the top ten marijuana brands in the country.
Canopy is also prioritizing higher-priced products such as premium cannabis flowers, pre-rolled joints and edibles, a move that is expected to improve its gross margins over the course of the fiscal year, finance chief Mike Lee said.
The focus on the higher-priced segment and cost cuts helped Canopy's adjusted gross margin expand by 14% in the quarter. Adjusted core loss narrowed to C$63.6 million, from C$92.2 million a year earlier.
But a 23% rise in revenue missed analysts' estimates as lockdowns in Germany hit its business.
Increasing pot demand and a larger market share will help Canopy improve its revenue and profitability in the second half, Lee said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's banks are stashing cash to pay bumper bonuses to top performers, amid a deal frenzy driven by pent up demand from the COVID-19 pandemic and rebounding bank profits.
Banks have added billions of dollars to bonus pools as they try to reassure restless staff they will be rewarded in 2021 after a lean 2020.
The planned payouts are more modest than the bonus bonanza on Wall Street, but European banks nonetheless risk a public backlash at a time when many businesses and individuals are still struggling in the pandemic, advocacy groups for fair pay said.
Britain-based  Barclays  (LON:BARC) increased its bonus pool by 46% to 1.1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion), up from 749 million pounds a year earlier, while HSBC topped up its bonus pool by $900 million in the first half.
Standard Chartered said a ""normalisation of performance-related pay"" during the first half drove an 8% jump in costs, to $5.1 billion.
Senior bank executives and recruiters said the market is the most competitive they have seen in a decade, as rebounding economies worldwide, pent-up demand and the fad for investing via Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) drives dealmaking activity.
Swiss bank UBS boosted pay for its financial advisers by $242 million in the second quarter after booking higher revenues, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) upped pay and benefits in its investment bank by 6% compared with the same period a year ago.
Bonuses and pay increases are likely to continue to build in the second half of the year, said Sophie Scholes, head of the UK financial services practice at headhunters Heidrick & Struggles (NASDAQ:HSII).
""Banks are anticipating that the next bonus round will be one where they need to pay out, driven by two factors,"" she said.
""One is the sheer competition for talent, and that means retaining good people, and two is that because of all the market activity people have a good pipeline and some good wins behind them, and banks are trying to prepare for that.""
The trend is global, Scholes said, with banks in Europe and Asia playing catch-up to the United States.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has increased its compensation by $3.5 billion on the prior year, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has added $2 billion.
Goldman has also raised base pay for juniors to $110,000 after rivals such as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan increased first-year pay. 
This is prompting European rivals to follow suit, with HSBC this week telling staff it would pay newly hired analysts in its U.S. investment bank $100,000 a year. 
""The U.S. is extraordinary in terms of activity, which comes from their economic recovery being seen as more robust, and it has always been a highly acquisitive market in terms of talent,"" Scholes said. 
'MORALLY DUBIOUS'
While big payouts are back, in Britain rules that cap payouts at twice the level of base pay and concerns about public perception of banker bonuses during a global crisis mean lenders are showing some restraint.
""Paying out huge bonuses at a time when businesses and households are struggling and the economic outlook remains so uncertain is not only morally dubious but financially irresponsible,"" said Simon Youel, head of policy and advocacy at Positive Money.
Youel said much of banks' recent profitability could be traced to state support measures for the economy. British newspaper reports have suggested UK banks are lobbying to remove the cap on bonuses of twice base pay, which Youel said the government should reject. 
The volatile nature of investment banks' revenues means they must lower variable pay to manage profitability in tough times, Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley said, and also pay up when business is booming.
""When we have in fact delivered very strong revenue growth, that's reflected in the compensation... we think we are being prudent in how we manage it,"" he told reporters last week on a conference call.
One bank board rejected an executive's rating of their team as too generous and told them to downgrade it for fear of otherwise having to pay out too much, Scholes said.
Even traditionally more conservative retail banks are increasing pay.
Lloyds (LON:LLOY), Britain's bellwether mortgage lender, said it would spend an extra 100 million pounds on bonuses this year, after axing them for all but its lowest paid staff last year.
Bank executives said they would have to keep paying up despite concerns about public perception.

""We have to reward people,"" the Chief Executive of a British bank said, without wanting to be identified. ""People have had a difficult time, and if you've stayed in a role and you've been locked away and had to go above and beyond, you expect to be rewarded.""

580,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 11:50AM ET</span>","Zynga Tanks As Bookings Soften, User Acquisition Costs Rise","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Zynga stock (NASDAQ:ZNGA) slumped 19% Friday as the social games developer indicated softness in bookings towards the end of the second quarter and said the cost of acquiring new players has risen in the wake of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new privacy rules.
The company felt a softness in bookings the second quarter owing to economies reopening and people stepping out to eat, drink and just enjoy life after a year of being home due to the pandemic. This resulted in declines in player cohorts who installed its games in the early part of 2021.
Apple's new privacy policy makes it tougher for apps to track users and source their personal data for targeting them with their ads.
The company said it is moving the launch of Farmville 3 to the last quarter of the year from the third while raising the revenue guidance for the year one more time.
Zynga now expects 2021 revenue at $2.72 billion and bookings at $2.8 billion. The net loss for the year is seen at $135 million.
The company had its best-ever June-quarter with revenue rising 59% year-on-year to $720 million. Live services drove the revenue growth.
Advertising revenue and bookings both more than doubled, primarily driven by the momentum in the hyper-casual portfolio of Rollic, the Turkish company it bought last year, as well as strength in advertising yields.
Strong performances came from Toon Blast and Toy Blast as the company introduced two new beats – Disco (OTC:DSCSY) Fever and Teams – as well as Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells. Players engaged and competed in a new club-based Magical Mischief event.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) -Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies reported its biggest ever revenue drop in the first half of 2021, after U.S. sanctions drove it to sell a chunk of its once-dominant handset business and before new growth areas have fully matured.
The company generated revenue of 320.4 billion yuan ($49.56 billion), it said on Friday.
The biggest decline came from Huawei's consumer business group, which includes handsets, where revenue fell 47% to 135.7 billion yuan.
It eked out a 0.6 percentage point rise in its net profit margin to 9.8%, largely due to efficiency improvements, a company spokesperson said.
In 2019 former U.S. President Donald Trump put Huawei on an export blacklist and barred it from accessing critical technology of U.S. origin, affecting its ability to design its own chips and source components from outside vendors.
The sanctions hobbled Huawei's handset business, with Huawei dropping out of the top five vendors in China for the first time in more than seven years in the second quarter, shipping 6.4 million units, according to consultancy Canalys.
That compares with 27.4 million handsets shipped in China in Q2 2020, excluding shipments of Honor budget handsets. Huawei sold the brand in November.
The consumer business brought in over half of the company's revenue in 2019.
Revenue also fell 14% in the first half from Huawei's telecoms equipment business, which a spokesperson said was partially down to the slowdown in China's 5G rollout.
Huawei is trying to pivot towards software and business areas not at risk of U.S. pressure, according to an internal memo from founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei seen by Reuters in May.
""Our aim is to survive, and to do so sustainably,"" said Eric Xu, Huawei's rotating chairman, in a statement on the results. ""We've set our strategic goals for the next five years.""
The company started rolling out its Harmony operating system in June, meaning it is no longer wholly reliant on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Android platform. 
U.S. sanctions barred Google from providing technical support to new phone models.

First-half revenue from Huawei's enterprise business group grew 18% to 42.9 billion yuan, as the COVID-19 outbreak spurred industry demand for ICT connectivity, a spokesperson said.
Huawei is also seeing strong growth in its cloud services business, more than doubling in size in the first quarter to take a 20% market share in China, according to Canalys.

584,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 10:56AM ET</span>",Hippo CEO expects NYSE listing to fuel better home insurance,"(This August 3 story fixes sixth paragraph to indicate Hippo does not offer renters insurance)
By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hippo Holdings Inc wants to change homeowners' insurance by using customer data to make it faster and easier to get coverage, Hippo's chief executive said in an interview.
The company, which has a $5 billion valuation and went public through a blank-check company on Tuesday, is among a slew of ""insurtech"" listings that are trying to pry business from established insurers.
""I want to double down on tech, data and more engineering and more capabilities,"" CEO Assaf Wand said of the $638 million Hippo will receive in proceeds from the listing.
Hippo's sales aspirations mirror companies like Geico Corp and Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR), which have made the auto insurance market more competitive.
To get there, Hippo plans to develop algorithms that speed up policy quotes and create new products, Wand said.
Hippo is backed by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus. Founded in 2015, it does not offer renter's insurance, but does provide products aimed at other homeowner headaches that insurers traditionally do not cover, such as upkeep, security, repairs and eventually selling the place. 
For example, Hippo provides sensors that chirp when water leaks under a kitchen sink, so a plumber can be called to prevent serious damage. That helps the homeowner, but also reduces the amount Hippo would have to pay out in claims. Similarly, outside motion detectors can help prevent burglaries.
Hippo went public through Reinvent Technology Partners, its special purpose acquisition company, and started trading on Tuesday.
In mid-morning trading on Tuesday, Hippo shares were up 2.4% at $10.025, according to the New York Stock Exchange.
Hippo's total written premiums grew from $142 million in 2018 to $405 million in 2020, the company said. It forecasts $544 million this year and $2.28 billion by 2025.
""Hippo's grown extraordinarily fast,"" said Tom Mason, senior analyst at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence. ""The real estate market is so hot, that's a big part of their growth.""
Other recently listed insurtechs like Lemonade Inc and Porch Group Inc have gone up since their listings. 
But there are risks from a housing market down-shift, Mason said. And insurtechs broadly need to show steady profitability to win over investors, said Robert Le, analyst at PitchBook.

""High-growth insurtech companies with high loss ratios are risky,"" Le said. 
Hippo bought property and casualty insurer Spinnaker Insurance Co last year, gaining licenses in all 50 U.S. states. It currently sells in 37 states, reaching about 80% of U.S. homeowners and expects to expand to 90% this year. Among large population states, it offers coverage in California but not in New York.

""We continue to carefully reduce cyber limits and are obtaining tighter terms and conditions to address increasing cyber loss trends, the rising threat associated with ransomware and the systemic nature of cyber risk generally,"" CEO Peter Zaffino said on a conference call with analysts, according to a transcript produced by Refinitiv.
AIG (NYSE:AIG)'s planned sale of part of its life and retirement business through an initial public offering is likely in the first quarter of 2022, Zaffino said. The company had previously aimed for the fourth quarter of the current year for the IPO. 
The company currently plans to offer more than 9.9% of its life and retirement unit in the IPO but said the size is not yet clear. 
Private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) will acquire a 9.9% stake for $2.2 billion in AIG's Life Retirement business, the companies had said last month, in an all-cash transaction.
AIG said on Friday that it has flexibility to sell more than 19.9% of the business due to gains from the sale of affordable housing coupled with other factors. 

AIG shares were up 4.1% at $50.64 in early trade on Friday. 
On Thursday, AIG posted second-quarter profit that beat estimates, driven by strong performance in its general insurance and life and retirement units.

Investing.com –  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock plunged 20% Friday as the company put off seeking emergency use authorization for its two-dose Covid vaccine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to fourth quarter.
The company has already delayed requesting the FDA for EUA for several months now, losing out on billions of dollars of a market that has benefited rivals such as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX).
The company has filed for regulatory approval for its Covid vaccine in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. It plans to submit the vaccine for emergency use listing at the World Health Organization this month.
WHO’s approval will allow global distribution of the vaccine through initiatives at the global agency.
Novavax said data from clinical trials indicate that a booster dose of its vaccine candidate provides a four-fold increase in neutralizing antibody levels after a two-dose regimen.
The company said it is on track to produce 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter and 150 million per month by the end of the fourth.

By Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden's tougher regulatory stance on big corporate mergers has fueled a rise in investor bets on some deals not being completed, threatening to push the brakes on a record-setting dealmaking boom. 
Spreads between deal prices and the share prices of acquisition targets widened this week after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday that a surge in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) would delay antitrust reviews, and that companies that did not wait for their outcome completed their deals at their own risk.
On Wednesday, the Information reported that the U.S. Department of Justice was weighing a lawsuit to block UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH)'s nearly $8 billion deal to acquire health care analytics and technology vendor Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG). Such a move would follow its lawsuit to block Aon (NYSE:AON)'s $30 billion acquisition of Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW), which resulted in the insurance brokerages abandoning their deal last month.
""The fact that spreads have widened is the understatement of the year,"" said Roy Behren, managing member of Westchester Capital Management, which currently has $5.1 billion of assets under management, 85% of which is invested in merger arbitrage.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. 
Widened spreads include the proposed $33.6 billion deal between railroad operators Canadian National Railway and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), as both companies await approval from the Surface Transportation Board. Shares of Kansas City are currently trading at $262 apiece, well below the agreed cash-and-stock deal of $325 per share.
Other deals where spreads have increased include  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM)' nearly $15 billion all-stock deal for cloud-based call center operator Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) Inc and medical device maker Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO)'s $17.4 billion buyout of contract researcher PPD (NASDAQ:PPD) Inc. 
Adding to the anxiety of merger investors are the escalating geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. China can thwart mergers of U.S. companies if they have a significant present in the country. 
The spread on semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc's $35 billion acquisition of  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX) has widened in recent days for that reason, investors said.

""The climate of fear surrounding transactions that require Chinese approval is as difficult as I've seen in many, many years,"" said Behren. 
It is not uncommon for M&A spreads to widen in times of uncertainty. They blew up dramatically in March 2020, when Wall Street fretted over the financial fallout of the coronavirus outbreak.

LONDON (Reuters) - The most devastating frost in decades in top coffee producer Brazil and record freight costs sparked by COVID-19 causing massive shipping logjams are expected to push retail prices to multi-year highs in the coming weeks.
A hike in coffee prices will further raise the cost of a basket of shopping following increases for other items such as bread, vegetable oils and sugar. The United Nations food agency's index of world food prices for July showed a year-on-year rise of 31% at a time when many consumers are struggling financially due to the pandemic.
The worst cold snap in Brazil since 1994 sent the price of green coffee beans to the highest level in almost seven years and is expected to pass through to consumers when they purchase roasted beans or ground coffee in supermarkets.
Arabica coffee on the ICE (NYSE:ICE) Futures U.S. exchange has doubled in price over the last 12 months with crops in Brazil already wilting after the worst dry spell in 91 years.
The extent of the damage is still being assessed but in areas where coffee trees have not survived it may take up to seven years for production to fully recover.
Shipping disruptions, caused partly by a surge in demand for consumer goods and not enough ships as people stayed home due to the global coronavirus pandemic, has also led to a sharp rise in the cost of transporting beans to major consuming countries in North America and Europe.
Traders believe while consumers will soon have to pay more to purchase coffee from supermarkets, the cost of a latte or Americano at high street coffee chains may not follow suit in the short term.
""Roast and ground (coffee in supermarkets) has only coffee and a bit of packaging. Your coffee at Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) might not go up (as much) cause you pay more for the shop, the wifi, the experience,"" he added.
Data issued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show average ground coffee prices rose to a peak of $4.75 per lb in April, up 8.1% from a year earlier and the highest level since July 2015, as drought took an initial toll on Brazil's crops.
The rise in arabica coffee prices on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange accelerated rapidly, however, after the recent frost and retail prices appear certain to increase in response. 
In Brazil, the world's number two consuming nation after the United States, roast and ground coffee prices increased 3.4% in June, according to statistics office IBGE.
They are set to rise further. After the July frosts, Brazil's coffee industry group Abic told roasters to analyse their costs and adjust prices accordingly, to preserve the sustainability of their businesses.
Abic estimates that green coffee prices for roasters in Brazil increased around 80% from December to late July.
""Some companies, including market leaders, have already announced price increases,"" Abic said in a letter to associated roasters seen by Reuters.
JDE Peet's, whose brands include Douwe Egberts, Kenco and Peet's, noted that there had been a sharp rise in ingredient, freight and other costs in the last 12 months.
""Historically, significant fluctuations in green coffee prices have been reflected in the market (retail prices) and we expect that precedent to continue,"" the company said.
TRANSPORT COSTS
The rise in transport costs, linked to a shortage of shipping containers, could play a major role in driving up prices. Coffee is normally shipped in containers, in contrast to commodities such as grains which are transported in bulk carriers.
Many coffee companies find it easier to withstand a rise in the cost of beans, at least in the short term, than increasing shipping costs as they often fix the price of their purchases several months in advance.
""We have hedging here in place for a good percentage of our coffee needs for the rest of this year and even for part of next year so I'm not short-term worried about that,"" Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider said during a recent conference call, adding this was not the case with transportation costs.
Carlos Santana, coffee head trader for Eisa Interagricola, a unit of ECOM Trading, said it was very challenging to ship coffee, particularly in the Americas.
""It is almost not economical to use this route right now. The ports in the U.S. are full, shipping companies do not want to take more cargoes to there, so they charge more. Prices are more than three times higher than they were before the pandemic,"" he said.
Thiago Cazarini, a coffee broker in Brazil's Minas Gerais state, said that even paying up the much higher prices to secure a container, exporters are having problems trying to load them into the ships.
He said the problem is widespread, impacting all players.
""Brazil is such a mess logistically right now. I have coffees that were supposed to arrive two months ago and I haven't got them yet,"" one U.S. coffee importer said.
Julian Thomas, managing director of Maersk Brazil, part of the world's biggest container shipping line, said the ""current bottlenecks from measures to contain the pandemic and a strong demand are also impacting supply chains in and out of Brazil.""

""We are still servicing our customers and can attend to their growing demand,"" he told Reuters.
German container shipper Hapag Lloyd added that there were delays for shipping goods, ""but not only coffee"".     Brazil accounts for an estimated 30% of global exports and its peak shipment season has already kicked off.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Friday it has opened a preliminary investigation into reports some 2019 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans, configured for use as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivery vehicles or ambulances, roll away shortly after being shifted to park.
The agency said it had 11 reports of the issue after vehicles were shifted to park using the Auto-P function. NHTSA said it had reports of eight crashes and one injury related to the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500/3500/4500 vans. The agency did not disclose the total number of vehicles under investigation. 
Mercedes-Benz Cars & Vans said in an email the company ""has been in close communication with NHTSA about its concerns and will continue to fully cooperate with the agency.""
Amazon did not immediately comment.
The agency reports do not specify how many of the eight crash reports were in vans used as Amazon delivery vehicles. 
In a March 16 complaint, a driver in Pittsburgh said the vehicle was turned off and in park and ""it rolled backwards down a hill on top of someone's car and could have killed someone ... This is my second Amazon-branded Mercedes Sprinter accident on different vehicles, with the same exact faulty brake operating system.""

A complaint in February from Manchester, Connecticut, said the issue is with 2019 Sprinter vans rolling out of park after 10 minutes of idling. The complaint said it believes the issue is ""potentially an extremely dangerous situation.""
A preliminary investigation is the first step before NHTSA decides whether to upgrade its review to an engineering evaluation. NHTSA said ""a rollaway vehicle with no operator behind the steering wheel could potentially strike pedestrians, moving or parked vehicles or buildings resulting in injury, fatality and/or property damage.""

Investing.com –  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) stock plummeted over 9% Friday as the company's chief executive said “the road to full travel recovery remains bumpy until more of the world is vaccinated” even as the company delivered a quarterly loss that more than halved from last time.
Just as travel, tourism and entertainment businesses were clawing back, a resurgent virus, mainly the delta variant, has led to fresh lockdowns in various parts of the world. Countries are resorting to vaccine passports and clamping down on travel. Governments are also considering booster doses.       
Net loss in the June quarter was $301 million compared to a $753-million loss in the same quarter of last year.
Revenue also quadrupled, coming in at $2.11 billion, up 273% from $566 million. Gross bookings jumped 667% to $20.81 billion as people looked to travel and made more bookings to fly and stay at hotels after a year of being stuck at home due to the pandemic.
Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) trends for lodging, air, and other travel products all improved sequentially from the first quarter of 2021, the company said. Both Retail and B2B segment revenue increased which the company attributed to continued improvement in leisure travel trends during the quarter.
Lodging revenue increased and was driven by more room nights stayed and growth in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night benefited from higher average daily rates.

LONDON (Reuters) -London Stock Exchange Group reported a sharp rise in first-half revenues on Friday, along with progress integrating data group Refinitiv and a dividend increase, triggering the best daily performance in its shares so far this year.
British stock exchange operator LSEG said its total revenue rose 4.6% to 3.36 billion pounds ($4.7 billion), helped by a 9.6% rise in capital markets revenue as listings enjoyed their best first half since 2014, and higher fixed income volumes.
Shares in the 300-year-old bourse were up 6.3% at 1300 GMT, marking their best day since December 2020 and topping the blue chip FTSE 100 index and Europe's STOXX 600.
""We have had a terrific first half of the year - capital raising is very robust and a number of companies have been coming to market,"" chief executive David Schwimmer told reporters after LSEG said its operating profit jumped to 1.17 billion pounds from 457 million pounds a year earlier.
Schwimmer said he expected the rest of 2021 to remain busy for initial public offerings (IPOs) and a modest number of special purpose acquisition companies to list. 
The CEO is trying to transform LSEG into a one-stop shop for data, trading and analytics with its $27 billion takeover of Refinitiv. But the costs of absorbing the data provider have worried some investors and its shares are down 20% since early March when it gave more details on the integration.
The group said that about 77 million pounds of cost savings from the deal have been realised so far. It saw those rising to 125 million pounds by the end of the year, up from its previous 88 million pound forecast.
""Progress with run rate synergies looks faster than anticipated,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said in a note, adding that the estimated cost growth in the 'low single digits' for 2022 and 2023 should also reassure the market. 
LSEG said that it expected further cost increases in the second half of 2021, caused by the return of costs, such as travel, that were affected by the coronavirus pandemic as well as ongoing expenses from legacy IT and inflation. 
It said it would pay an interim dividend of 25 pence per share, a rise of 7% from a year ago.
Schwimmer said the company had identified and was addressing the cause of problems with Refinitiv's news and data platform Eikon after a number of outages.

Investing.com –  Carvana  (NYSE:CVNA) stock soared over 9% in Friday’s trading as a booming market for used vehicles, coming at a time chip shortage has held back sales of new units, propelled the company to its first ever quarter of net profit.
June-quarter revenue of $3.33 billion was also the first time the company crossed the $3-billion mark, almost trebling from $1.11 billion in the same period last year.
Net income was $45 million, up from a loss of $106 million in the prior-year period.
Retail sales also touched a record and almost doubled to 107,815 units from 55,098 units in the June quarter of 2020.
Retailers of used cars like Carvana and CarMax (NYSE:KMX) have benefited immensely from the chip shortage that has hurt carmakers. Customers have had to face long waiting periods as shortage of chips has delayed production of vehicles.
The pandemic fueled unprecedented demand for digital devices like laptops, mobiles and printers as companies and individuals went for a hybrid office-home model. Vehicle manufacturers were the worst hit.
Total gross profit per unit for the second quarter was $5,120, an increase of $2,394.
For the full year now, Carvana expects GPU at over $4,000, significantly above its mid-$3,000s outlook at the beginning of the year.

596,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 08:51AM ET</span>","Global investors, Indian startups press Modi for overseas listings","By Aditya Kalra and Abhirup Roy
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Leading investors including Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed have called on India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi to spur rules to allow companies to list overseas for better access to capital, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
India in September allowed companies to list directly on foreign exchanges https://reut.rs/376I7cW like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, but the government has yet to announce rules required to govern such listings. 
Calling it an ""unfinished reform agenda"", some 22 investors and top Indian startups such as food-delivery app Swiggy and online tutoring firm Byju's wrote to Modi urging him to expedite the policy.
""The current inability of unlisted companies to tap international markets for raising capital is ... an impediment to the growth ambitions of Indian startups,"" they said in the July 29 letter.
Swiggy and Sequoia declined to comment. Other entities, as well as Modi's office, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The new policy is seen as a shot in the arm for Indian unicorn start-ups valued at more than $1 billion and the digital unit of conglomerate Reliance, which is eyeing a U.S. listing after raising more than $20 billion from investors last year.
But the letter comes when many are choosing to list in India. 
China's Ant Group-backed Indian food delivery firm Zomato had a stellar debut https://www.reuters.com/technology/ant-backed-zomato-jumps-53-above-offer-price-india-market-debut-2021-07-23 on Indian bourses recently, valuing the firm at $13 billion, while others including SoftBank-backed ride-hailing firm Ola are also eyeing local listings.
""Even as some companies are gearing up to list in India, many others are keen to evaluate the option of an international listing,"" the letter said, highlighting how companies in other markets like the United States have a much bigger market capitalization than in India.
The London Stock Exchange, which is tracking India's policy change closely, told Reuters last year https://www.reuters.com/article/india-stocks-lse-listing-idINKBN26U1BZ it had been in talks with several Indian tech firms on overseas listings. Such listings will present an opportunity for some of the world's leading exchanges to vie for India's rapidly growing startup companies.

The Indian government however had been concerned that overseas listing could mean that companies hunting for higher valuations through access to a wider group of investors would choose to only list abroad, hurting prospects of Indian markets.
The group of investors and startups told Modi such concerns were ""unfounded"" and that overseas listings will increase interest of foreign investors in Indian startups.

597,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 08:06AM ET</span>",Insurers worry about COVID-19 discrimination claims as workers return to desks,"By Carolyn Cohn, Noor Zainab Hussain and Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Liability insurers on both sides of the Atlantic are scaling back the cover they offer companies ahead of an expected wave of discrimination claims as employers call staff back to their desks after 18 months of pandemic-induced home working. 
There have been around 2,950 COVID-19-related employment lawsuits in the United States since the start of the pandemic, ranging from disputes over remote working to workplace safety and discrimination, law firm Fisher Phillips says.
Now industry sources say companies are starting to trigger policies which protect them against the cost of defending discrimination lawsuits and compensation awards, so-called employment practices liability insurance (EPLI). 
That is making underwriters nervous.
Adrian Cox, chief executive of Beazley, a large Lloyd's of London insurer, calls this a ""high exposure area"", particularly in North America.
""How you don't discriminate, how you deal with vaccination and testing – those are all difficult things for employers to work through,"" he told Reuters.
Karen Cargill, management liability specialist at insurance broker Marsh in London, said a fifth of notifications by its insurer clients of possible EPLI claims in Britain have been COVID-related in the past six months. 
JABS FOR JOBS
Insurers, employers and lawyers see mandatory vaccinations as a small but growing area of contention.
Tech giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) are among firms who have told all U.S. employees to be inoculated against COVID-19 before stepping into offices or onto campuses to help protect the health and safety of colleagues.
U.S. vaccination-related claims amount to less than 5% of total COVID-19 suits - or fewer than 150 - said Kevin Troutman, partner and co-chair of Fisher Phillips' Healthcare Industry Team. But that is expected to rise.
""The vaccine mandates conundrum is just the next version of COVID claims that we're going to see,"" said Kelly Thoerig, who oversees Marsh's U.S. EPLI practice.
According to the preliminary results of an ongoing pulse survey of more than 200 American employers launched on July 19 by consultants Mercer, 14% now require staff to be vaccinated in order to work at a company site.
A number of U.S. employers with such policies have already faced court hearings. Workers at a Texas hospital alleged the vaccinations are experimental and that staff are being used as ""human guinea pigs"". 
The case was dismissed in June and some lawyers say this type of case is unlikely to be viable.
But workers could have protection if they are unable to be vaccinated for medical or religious reasons - unless this would pose an ""undue hardship"" on the business, the U.S. Insurance Information Institute says.
Vulnerable workers could also sue employers because a lack of a mandatory vaccination policy puts them at risk. 
However, even if cases are thrown out, defence costs would fall to the employers - and their insurers. 
Employment lawyers in Britain have seen fewer discrimination lawsuits so far. 
In one case in Scotland, a chef won his unfair dismissal claim after being fired without notice having raised concerns about a lack of personal protective equipment and the risk of passing on the coronavirus to his vulnerable father.
On vaccination, lawyers say that ""no jab, no job"" contracts - such as those offered by London-based Pimlico Plumbers - risk discriminating against younger staff, who may not yet have been offered their second vaccine, or pregnant women, who might prefer to be vaccinated after childbirth. 
""If an employee has decided to refuse the vaccine through personal choice...it would be possible to exclude them from the premises on the grounds of health and safety,"" said Jo Keddie, a lawyer at Winckworth Sherwood.
""(But) if an employee refuses to have the vaccination because of a health condition or a religious belief, they could argue that a mandatory vaccination policy is disability or religious discrimination.""
PRICED OUT?
Many insurers are cutting their exposure by adding restrictions to new or renewed policies, requiring employers to bear more of the costs, and increasing premium rates, according to Jason Binette, EPLI  product manager at AmTrust Exec in Windsor, Connecticut. 
Lloyd's of London insurers are among those to strip EPLI cover out of broader insurance packages they offer businesses, to keep a lid on prices. But specialist insurers in Bermuda, for example, still offer such cover, brokers said.
Business is booming for those who still sell EPLI, and premium rates are surging. 
AmTrust has recorded a 22% increase in requests for cover since the pandemic started, driven in part by new small business customers.
""I'm seeing companies that have been around for 40 years that haven't had coverage ... and now want it,"" Binette said, adding that premium rates had jumped by 10-20%. 
Sam Vardy, associate director at insurance broker Howden in London, puts the rate rise at 25-75% over the past 18 months.

Some employers simply say the price of EPLI is too high to risk bringing staff back to offices, according to Julia Graham (NYSE:GHM), CEO of UK insurance buyers' association Airmic.
""They can't get (insurance) at the price they are willing to pay,"" she said.

The collapse of the funds in March kicked off a tumultuous period for the bank, culminating with a multi-billion dollar loss related to investment fund Archegos, a raft of executive oustings and an impending strategic overhaul.
The payout, originally announced with the bank's second-quarter earnings last week, is the fourth distribution so far and takes the total amount returned to the investors to roughly $5.9 billion.
Together with cash that has already been distributed and cash remaining in the funds, the cash position is equivalent to approximately $6.6 billion or 66% of the funds' assets under management at the time of their suspension, the bank added.
The lender also said on Friday it was paying back money to investors in four separate  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) funds that were invested in supply chain funds that had illiquid assets.
These assets, hived off into so-called side pockets, are now being liquidated with shareholders receiving a payment pro rata to their holding on August 10. The amounts involved are much smaller than in the main payout.
In March and April, $4.8 billion was returned to investors in the Greensill-linked funds in two installments, while another $750 million was returned in July.
""Liquidation proceeds will be distributed as soon as feasible until the investors receive the funds' total net collected liquidation proceeds,"" Credit Suisse's asset management arm said on Friday. 

""Investors will receive notification of these payments. Management fees are waived with immediate effect.""
The bank said it was continuing to liquidate assets as receivables mature but warned investors that they may suffer losses.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>","Chinese retailer Shein lacks disclosures, made false statements about factories","By Victoria Waldersee
(Reuters) -Shein, the fast-growing Chinese online retailer, has not made public disclosures about working conditions along its supply chain that are required by law in the United Kingdom, and the company until recently falsely stated on its website that conditions in the factories it uses were certified by international labor standards bodies, Reuters has found. 
In Britain, companies over a certain size must prominently state on their websites the steps they are taking to combat forced labor as part of the country’s Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Shein’s “social responsibility” page states that it “never, ever” engages in child or forced labor, but does not provide the full supply chain disclosures required by British law. 
The law mandates that firms selling more than 36 million pounds of goods globally per year must provide a statement on a searchable link available on a prominent place on its home page, dated to a financial year and signed by a director, outlining the steps it is taking to prevent modern slavery in its supply chain.
Shein declined to provide its annual revenue to Reuters, stating it does not disclose its revenue publicly. Analysts have estimated the company’s valuation at $15 billion, with annual revenue of at least $5 billion.
A spokesperson for Shein said it is in the process of finalizing statements required by UK law, and plans to publish them on its website. “We are developing comprehensive policies, which we will post on our website in the next couple of weeks,” the Shein spokesperson said on Aug. 2. 
Britain’s Home Office, which is charged with enforcing the disclosure law, said it does not comment on specific cases.
In Australia, a similar law requires companies with revenue over A$100 million per year to submit an annual modern slavery statement to the Australian Border Force (ABF).
The ABF confirmed to Reuters that foreign entities exporting to Australia were required to submit a statement if their revenue was above the threshold.
As of Aug. 4, neither Shein nor its subsidiary in that country had submitted such a statement, according to a register maintained by the ABF. 
Following questions from Reuters, a Shein spokesperson told Reuters that the company was compliant with Australia’s law, without elaborating on whether it believed it was not required to report or whether it had submitted a statement since Reuters’ questioning. 
The ABF declined to comment on Shein.
Reuters could not independently assess the working conditions in any factories used by Shein or the wages it pays. The retailer did not respond to a request for comment on what its standards for suppliers are. 
LOW PRICES, LACK OF TRANSPARENCY
Over the past 18 months, privately held Shein, whose official name is Zoetop Business Co Ltd, has taken the fast-fashion world by storm. The company’s Instagram and TikTok accounts have more than 23 million followers, many of them young women showing off its cheap clothes, such as $9 dresses and $15 shoes. Its website drew more than 160 million visitors in June, according to web traffic analytics firm Similarweb (NYSE:SMWB), overtaking rivals Zara and H&M. 
The company’s ultra-low prices and lack of transparency have prompted labor watchdogs, including the Worker Rights Consortium and the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, to question how it produces its merchandise so cheaply.
Shein is based in China but sells online to customers only outside the country. Its biggest investors include Sequoia Capital China and Tiger Global Management. Both declined to comment for this story.
Some of Shein’s major rivals, including H&M, Zara-parent  Inditex  (MC:ITX), ASOS (LON:ASOS), Boohoo and Zalando, publish statements, as well as more detailed information on their supply chain such as factory lists and codes of conduct, on their websites. 
H&M’s website includes a downloadable spreadsheet with specific names and addresses of thousands of its factories and processing facilities. Inditex has an eight-page, downloadable code of conduct and a map showing the number of its factories and suppliers in each country. 
Separately, in a statement on its website last seen by Reuters on July 26, Shein said the factories it worked with were “certified” by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and that Shein was ""proudly in compliance with strict fair labor standards set by international organizations like SA8000.” 
SA8000 is a management systems standard based on international human rights principles outlined by the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations which measures companies’ performance in eight areas including child labor, forced labor and health and safety.
ISO is a global organization which develops commercial, industrial and technical standards. Companies pay certification bodies to implement and audit these standards at their organizations.
ISO only establishes standards and does not carry out certifications themselves, a spokesperson said. A company “cannot be either accredited or certified by ISO,"" the spokesperson said. 

Social Accountability International, which administers the SA8000 standard, said that Shein had not been certified through its program and that it had not had any contact with the company. 
Shein removed the page after Reuters asked the company questions about it. The same web address now takes users to a new “social responsibility” page, which makes no mention of ISO or SA8000.

European bond funds attracted $7.4 billion, while U.S. bond funds received $6.7 billion. Asian bond funds also attracted small inflows.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Oliver Baete, chief executive officer of Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG), on Friday spoke of a ""horrible week"" for him and the insurer, his first response to a disclosure that the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating losses at its fund division.
Baete, making an unexpected appearance to reporters in a call after the company's second-quarter earnings, said the insurer would set aside possible reserves for the case when the time is appropriate and conceded ""not everything was perfect in the fund management"".
The issue, disclosed by Allianz on Sunday and which overshadowed better-than-expected earnings on Friday, is a blow to the reputation of one of Germany's most valuable companies and its global operations that in recent years have stayed out of the headlines.
""It was a horrible week for us and for me personally,"" he said. 
In March last year, Allianz shuttered two private hedge funds after severe losses during the market mayhem sparked by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
That prompted a wave of litigation by U.S. investors claiming around $6 billion in losses from the so-called Structured Alpha family of funds.
The investors, which include pension funds for truckers, teachers and subway workers, say that the fund division, Allianz Global Investors, strayed from a strategy of using options to protect against a short-term financial market crash.
Last year, Allianz revealed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was also investigating. It says it is actively cooperating with both bodies and defending itself in the lawsuits. 
""This event will leave its mark, but it will not change Allianz's path,"" Baete said. 
Baete said he regretted that investors lost money. Shares fell sharply on Monday after Sunday's disclosure. They were up 3.3% midday in Frankfurt on Friday.
Allianz, which has reviewed more than 1 million emails and documents as part of its forensic investigation into the matter, also revealed on Friday that the DOJ had requested information from current and former U.S. employees at the fund management division.
The DOJ has declined to comment on the matter.
Allianz posted a better-than-expected 46% jump in second-quarter net profit and provided a rosier outlook for the full year as it emerges from pressure on business caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Net profit attributable to shareholders of 2.225 billion euros ($2.60 billion) in the three months through June compares with 1.528 billion euros a year earlier. The figure beat a 2.055 billion euro consensus forecast.
More optimistic about the outlook for this year, the company said it now expects operating profit in 2021 to be in the upper half of a range of between 11 billion and 13 billion euros.
Last year, the insurer abandoned its profit target due to economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic and posted its first decline in operating profit in nearly a decade. 
Allianz, like other insurers, had faced clients making claims for business interruption and cancelled events from lockdowns, while demand for car and travel insurance fell.

In another sign of a return to normal times for the insurance group, Allianz announced on Thursday plans to buy back up to 750 million euros worth of shares by the end of the year, after last year cancelling a buyback halfway through due to the pandemic.

Maersk, which handles one in five containers shipped worldwide, aims to expand its land-based logistics services, hoping to gain a larger share of the supply chain from existing shipping clients such as Puma and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
It bought Visible Supply Chain Management and B2C Europe, both specialised in e-commerce, for a combined enterprise value of $924 million, Maersk said.
""It won't be long before we have a logistics business with (annual) revenues of $10 billion with these two acquisitions,"" Chief Executive Soren Skou told reporters.
While container shipping, which accounted for 73% of revenue last year, will continue to be at the centre of the company, land-based services such as shipments from factories, customs services and warehousing will be its growth engine.
Skou said more acquisitions were expected in the coming quarters, adding that it was in particular looking at small to mid-sized companies within air freight, warehousing and distribution in Latin America and Europe.
Maersk on Friday also confirmed a 60% jump in second-quarter revenue and a more than tripling of its quarterly core profit announced in a preliminary trading statement earlier this week, when it raised its 2021 profit outlook.
The pandemic has prompted shortages of container ships and logjams at ports at a time of very high consumer spending which has sent freight rates to record levels.
""The results benefited both from the exceptional circumstances in Ocean, where congestion and bottlenecks continued to drive up rates, and from solid progress in executing on our strategic transformation,"" CEO Soren Skou said. 

""The outlook for the third quarter is strong and we expect that the current momentum in Ocean will continue into the fourth quarter,"" he said.

(Reuters) - UBS Global Wealth Management is betting on a reflation trade in the United States and globally linked to economic reopening as the world emerges from the COVID-19 Delta variant, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at the world's largest wealth manager, said.
""Not all of the inflation is going to go back to deflationary levels,"" Haefele told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Thursday, adding that he was bullish on equities, specifically the energy and financials sectors, along with Japan.
Valuations in emerging markets are attractive from a longer-term perspective, he said, as in the near-term there is uncertainty after China's recent regulatory crackdown and a relatively slower COVID-19 vaccination roll-out.
Haefele, whose firm manages $3.2 trillion in assets, said he didn't think there was a bubble in the equity markets, and expected the S&P 500 moving ""modestly higher"" from current levels, supported by strong earnings and as long as the U.S. Federal Reserve continued providing monetary support.
""I think the equity bubble, if it exists, is certainly not as big as the bond bubble,"" he added.
Concerns about the Delta variant have set back the timeline for recovery by a little bit, he said, adding that the Fed won't start on a path to normalisation until its employment targets are achieved.
""We're not there yet ... I think the Fed has left itself a lot more room to be lenient, because they've moved to this average inflation targeting (AIT),"" Haefele said.
He did not see the markets reacting in a 2013-style taper tantrum as he expects the Fed will have flexibility due to its transition to AIT and a broader definition of employment.
""I think Chair Powell ... wants to avoid that situation ... The Fed will run hotter before they start talking about things like raising rates,"" he said, which should cushion a blow around any taper tantrum.
Hefele expected the U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to move closer to 2% in the second half of 2021, and said he was ""underweight"" on high-grade bonds due to the risk around them.

""Historically, the rates are so low that we just don't see them (high-grade bonds) able to perform the same role in portfolios in terms of providing that stability during crisis.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) -Shares in Indonesia's first listed tech unicorn, PT Bukalapak.com soared 25% on their market debut on Friday as investors scrambled to get a piece of the country's fourth-largest e-commerce company in a booming sector.
Bukalapak shares closed at 1,060 rupiah ($0.0738) after reaching the 25% limit minutes after opening, with tens of thousands of investors buying shares on online platforms such as Ajaib and Stockbit, after the firm raised $1.5 billion in Indonesia's biggest IPO, valuing it at $6 billion.
""This event will create a snowballing effect and show the path for more Indonesia listings,"" said Willson Cuaca, a co-founder and managing partner at East Ventures, an Indonesia-focused venture capital firm.
The listing by the decade-old e-commerce platform, whose backers include Ant Group and Singapore sovereign fund GIC, has fuelled excitement in the thriving startup community, in a region that is home to more than 400 million internet users.
The IPO comes as Indonesia's $40 billion e-commerce market is getting a boost from stay-at-home consumers and a shift by more businesses to sell online during the pandemic.
""We initially ran a non-deal roadshow for 10 days in a row and I was literally having 11-12 meetings every day from 8 till 11 at night and these had to get extended as there was so much more interest,"" Bukalapak's president, Teddy Oetomo, a former banker, told Reuters in an interview.
He likened Bukalapak's business to Canadian e-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), which also works with brick-and-mortar retailers.
Investor interest is also running high ahead of a planned multibillion-dollar local IPO by GoTo, Indonesia's most valuable startup formed through the merger of ride-hailing and food delivery firm Gojek and e-commerce leader Tokopedia.
Southest Asian ride-hailing leader Grab is going public through a $40 billion merger with a U.S. special-purpose acquisition company.
HOMEGROWN UNICORNS
Bukalapak's stellar debut, which follows a string of recent eye-popping listings in Asia, vaulted Bukalapak's market value to $7.5 billion, placing it among Indonesia's 15 biggest companies.
On Friday, South Korean digital lender Kakao Bank surged 79% on its debut to be valued at $29 billion.
""Bukalapak's IPO shows that there is a large and vibrant market for homegrown Indonesian unicorns,"" said Antonio Puno, head of Southeast Asia corporate finance at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the joint global coordinators for the issue with UBS.
The company, which also counts Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and local media and conglomerate Emtek Group among its backers, reported a 26% revenue increase to $96 million in 2020, up 26% on the year. Registered users stood at 105 million.
Bukalapak, which means ""open stall"" in Bahasa, works with 7 million agents, or ""mitra"", primarily street kiosks and mom-and-pop shops, who it connects to consumer goods distributors, narrowing their supply chain and the costs of their wares.
It focuses on areas outside top-tier cities in the archipelago, and ranks behind Tokopedia, Sea Ltd's Shopee and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Lazada in the e-commerce segment in terms of market share and gross merchandise value.
Bukalapak increased its IPO size in multiple rounds and received roughly $6.5 billion of interest from institutional and retail investors. The IPO retail segment was doubled to 5%.
Two sources familiar with the matter said the firm had priced its IPO at an enterprise value to sales multiple of 16 times based on next year's estimated sales.
""This IPO has also demonstrated that Southeast Asia technology companies can achieve a premium valuation for growth with significant demand,"" said Nicolo Magni, head of global banking for Southeast Asia and India at UBS.

""This creates a platform for other companies to have sizeable, highly successful offerings to list in Indonesia or other regional exchanges.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's top court on Friday handed Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) a major victory in a dispute where it sought to block its partner Future Group from selling $3.4 billion in assets to rival Reliance Industries.
The outcome of the tussle involving two of the world’s richest men, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani, is seen reshaping India’s pandemic-hit shopping sector https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-india-future-reliance-idUSKBN2871AM and deciding if Amazon can blunt Reliance's dominance of the country's nearly trillion-dollar retail market.
Amazon and Future have been locked in legal battles https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-india-future-reliance-idUSKBN2AM0HN over the Future Group deal, with the U.S. firm accusing the Indian group of violating pre-existing contracts when it sold its assets to Reliance. Future has denied any wrongdoing.
A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court said that an interim decision by a Singapore arbitrator in October - that put the deal on hold after finding merit in Amazon's objections - was valid and enforceable in India. 
Amazon had argued that the order is binding, while Future had argued it was not. Both sides had agreed to use the Singapore arbitrator in case of disputes when Amazon invested $200 million in a unit of Future in 2019. The arbitration proceedings are still ongoing.
Shares in Future Retail were up 6% ahead of the ruling, but tanked 10% and hit a lower-circuit breaker in Mumbai trading after the order. Reliance Industries fell as much as 2.3%.
Future Retail said in a statement it had been ""advised that it has remedies available in law, which it will exercise."" It did not elaborate on the legal options, but said it will take steps to conclude the deal and protect the interests of its stakeholders and workforce.
Amazon said in a statement that it welcomed the court's ruling, adding: ""We hope that this will hasten a resolution of this dispute with Future Group.”
Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.
India strictly regulates its retail and e-commerce sector. That has made it difficult for foreign giants like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon to rapidly expand in one of the world’s fastest growing consumer markets, whose retail landscape is dominated by brick-and-mortar retailers.
LIQUIDATION FEARS
Future had previously said the deal's failure would push the company towards liquidation and impact livelihoods of 50,000 employees and 6,000 small- and medium-sized vendors. 
But the arbitrator in October said ""economic hardship alone is not a legal ground for disregarding legal obligations"".
Future is still trying to convince a Singapore arbitration panel to revoke the October interim decision stalling the deal, a lawyer involved in the case told Reuters on Friday. That decision is expected in coming weeks.
""Everything is clear for Amazon, it is a big win for them. It's for the arbitration panel to decide now,"" said the lawyer, who declined to be identified.
The dispute started after Future, India's second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, entered into a deal last year to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, after COVID-19 hit its operations hard. 
Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of Future's retail assets itself, argued the 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list including Reliance. 

Around 1,300 of Future's retail outlets in 400 cities sell groceries. Its budget supermarkets cater to middle-class shoppers, while its upmarket stores offer products like imported cheese and fresh guacamole, relatively rare in India's retail landscape. That makes Future a prized asset for both Reliance and Amazon.
Though the Supreme Court ruling is a shot in the arm for Amazon, it faces another challenge from India's antitrust regulator which recently accused the U.S. firm of concealing facts when it sought approval for the 2019 investment in the Future unit, Reuters has reported https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-india-watchdog-accuses-amazon-concealing-facts-deal-future-group-unit-2021-07-22. Amazon has said it is confident of addressing those concerns.

MPS initially faced some 10 billion euros in legal risks, seen as one of the main hurdles to Italian Treasury's plans to cut its 64% stake in the bank by mid-2022, as agreed as part of a 2017 state bailout. 
MPS' board on Thursday approved a settlement deal with the bank's former top investor, local banking foundation Fondazione Monte dei Paschi, reducing the risks by 3.8 billion euros.
According to the slide, Monte dei Paschi's legal risks stood at 4.9 billion euros as of June 30, of which 2.2 billion euros were classified as probable and for which provisions of 1 billion euros had been booked.
The Treasury has been working to offload MPS to healthier rival UniCredit and the parties agreed to enter exclusive talks over the bailed out bank last week.
Under the terms set by UniCredit to start negotiations, the Milanese bank will be shielded from any non-ordinary legal risks weighing on MPS following years of mismanagement.

Reuters had reported the Treasury was working to more than halve MPS' legal risks.

SEOUL/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Digital lender Kakao Bank Corp made a stunning debut on Friday, surging 79% from its IPO price to become South Korea's biggest financial services firm by market value.
It is the first online-only bank in Asia to go public, according to a person who worked on the deal - a milestone that has prompted frenzied demand, particularly as Chinese listings have fallen out of favour in the wake of regulatory crackdowns.
Kakao Bank, which counts the country's dominant chat app operator as its top shareholder, is expected to capitalise on rare growth opportunities for a financial firm afforded by an unusual South Korean regulatory framework. 
Due to its large user base, it is able to recommend and collect fees on products offered by other financial firms on a much bigger scale than many traditional lenders, and also has an advertising business. 
""Shareholders are bullish as it's a platform, not just a bank,"" said Seo Young-soo, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities.
Its shares closed at 69,800 won on Friday, compared with its IPO price of 39,000 won and valuing it at roughly $29 billion. 
By contrast, KB Financial Group Inc, South Korea's biggest traditional financial group, was worth $19 billion. 
""The heavy demand was due to local institutions not getting as much as they wanted during bookbuilding and foreign firms with money earmarked for fintech investments. On top of that, it seems some funds have been rerouted here due to the cancellation of Ant Financial's IPO and other major offerings from China amid the recent tech crackdown,"" said Kim Ji-young, analyst at Kyobo Securities. 
Kakao Bank became profitable in 2019 after less than two years in operation and has 13.35 million monthly active users, making it the largest financial app in the country.
""It's the only purely mobile digital bank in the world that has grown into a large bank with 28.6 trillion won ($25 billion) in assets in just four years,"" said Seo.
Some market participants said, however, that Kakao Bank's debut valuations were hard to justify given its earnings, noting that KB Financial is expected to post around 3 trillion won in net profit this year, more than ten times what Kakao Bank is likely to make.
EXPANSION PLANNED
Kakao Bank raised some $2.2 billion in its IPO and plans to use the proceeds to expand its platform-related businesses, which still only account for 6% of its income.
Three-quarters of the 804.2 billion won it made in operating profit last year was interest income. 
It offers unsecured personal credit loans and now holds 6% of that market. It also extends loans for the lump sums that Koreans must provide upfront when renting a property and plans to expand into mortgages and loans to small businesses.
Although Kakao Bank must compete with digital services from traditional banks, there is only one other pure online lender in South Korea, K Bank. K Bank, owned by BC Card and other domestic firms, reported an operating loss last year and has yet to announce any plans to list.
The IPO was the country's fourth-largest and its most subscribed ever with institutional demand reaching $2.2 trillion, marking another high point in what is shaping up to be a bumper year for South Korean stock market floats even if some valuations have been slashed in recent offerings.
Kakao Corp, Kakao Bank's top shareholder with a 27.3% stake, is also planning to take its payments affiliate public. 

But Kakao Pay, which is also backed by China's Ant Financial, has been asked by financial authorities to resubmit https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/skorean-regulator-tells-ant-backed-kakao-pay-revise-ipo-prospectus-2021-07-16 its IPO registration statement. Prior to that request it had been seeking to raise up to $1.4 billion for a market value of as much as $10.5 billion.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -ING Groep NV on Friday reported a better-than-expected quarterly pretax profit of 2.07 billion euros ($2.45 billion) and said it plans to resume paying dividends as it reversed some provisions for bad loans taken amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Analysts had forecast a pretax profit at 1.62 billion euros for the biggest Dutch bank, according to Refinitiv data. That compares with 532 million euros in pretax profit in the second quarter of 2020, at the height of pandemic lockdowns.
Provisions were a negative 91 million euros, compared with 1.37 billion euros a year earlier.
""Looking at risk costs, these are actually negative for the quarter, but we have to remain prudent, there are still a lot of risks in the economies,"" CEO Steven van Rijswijk said, pointing to uncertainty over COVID-19 variant strains.
ING's biggest markets, the Netherlands and Germany, are both forecast to grow by more than 3% this year, and the bank said the economic recovery - uneven but quicker than had been expected a year ago - was the main reason.
Fee income rose by 18% to 855 million euros, mostly in daily banking and investment products for retail customers.
Net interest income declined by 2.6% to 3.34 billion euros amid continuing low interest rates. ING said net interest income benefited by 83 million euros from its participation in ECB lending programs, in which banks are paid, rather than charged, to borrow money from the central bank, on the condition they lend it on to customers.
Still, ING's net interest margin, a key measure of lending profitability, shrank to 1.36% from 1.44% a year ago.
The ECB restricted banks from paying dividends at the onset of the pandemic and ING said on Friday it intends to distribute 3.62 billion euros in dividends, or 0.48 cents per share, in October, covering both 2020 and 2021 interim dividends. 
In addition, it will distribute 1.74 billion euros it has been holding since 2019, either by dividend or share buyback.
The money for those distributions is kept outside the bank's Tier 1 capital buffer, which stood at 15.7% at the end of the quarter.

ING shares closed at 11.17 euros on Thursday, up 46% in the year to date.

Investing.com – South Korea’s KakaoBank Corp. saw its shares climb more than 70% as it debuted on the Korean bourse. The country’s first internet-only company to go public also is now also its largest retail lender by market value.
KakaoBank shares soared 67.95% to KRW65,500 ($57.27) by 12:05 AM ET (4:05 AM GMT), after soaring as much as 74% earlier in the day. The company’s market capitalization of more than KRW32 trillion, or $27.98 billion, is bigger than any of South Korea’s more traditional financial groups.
Investors were caught off guard by the huge surge in share price, which is uncommon for Korean listings as retail investors usually snap up stocks on their first day of trading for quick returns.
“The current market capital appears to have overshot the expectations... the reality is that there is a huge concern about the stock’s sharp fall,” BNK Securities analyst Kim In said in a note ahead of the listing.
The company is the latest  Kakao Corp  . (KS:035720) subsidiary to list, following Kakao Games Corp.'s (KQ:293490) KRW384 billion listing in September 2020. Another subsidiary, online-payments service Kakao Pay Corp., was planning its own debut on Aug. 12 but will be delayed as the company revises its prospectus. Other Kakao Corp. subsidiaries that could also be going public include its ride-hailing, entertainment and Japan business units.
Founded in 2016, KakaoBank was one of the companies snapping up the first online banking permits offered by the government the year before. User numbers grew quickly thanks to Kakao Talk, a messenger service also under Kakao Corp. that currently has 46 million active users out of South Korea’s population of around 51 million."

Facebook said on Tuesday it had cut off the personal accounts and access of the New York University researchers because of concerns about other users' privacy.
Facebook had initially said that the decision was made out of a need for the social media giant to live up to a consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission.
But Facebook spokesman Joe Osborne later told Wired that the consent decree was not a reason to disable the researchers' accounts. Instead, the decree required the creation of rules for a privacy program, which is what he said the researchers had violated.
Laura Edelson, one of the researchers, denied any wrongdoing, Wired said.
The FTC posted a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying that it was ""inaccurate"" that the company's actions were required under the 2019 consent decree.
""While I appreciate that Facebook has now corrected the record, I am disappointed by how your company has conducted itself in this matter,"" wrote Sam Levine, the FTC's acting director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection. 
""The FTC received no notice that Facebook would be publicly invoking our consent decree to justify terminating academic research earlier this week.""
Facebook paid a record-setting $5 billion fine to resolve the FTC probe into its privacy practices and boosted safeguards on user data.

""While it is not our role to resolve individual disputes between Facebook and third parties, we hope that the company is not invoking privacy – much less the FTC consent order – as a pretext to advance other aims,"" he wrote.
Separately, the FTC sued Facebook in December for allegedly violating antitrust law. That complaint was dismissed and the agency has an Aug. 19 deadline to refile it.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller, the latest official to speak, said he is positive about the economic outlook and that asset tapering could begin sooner than expected. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari also said that he expects a strong job market in the fall, but warned that COVID-19 and its Delta variant remained a threat to global recovery.
The debate has even extended to the U.S. Senate, with senator Joe Manchin urging Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to begin asset tapering as the U.S. economy is at risk of overheating and saddling Americans with “unavoidable inflation taxes.”
The spread of the COVID-19 Delta strain continues to hamper the global economic recovery, with companies including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. delaying plans for their employees to return to the office.

""We lowered the ratings because Evergrande's liquidity position is eroding more quickly and by more than we previously expected,"" the rating agency said. 
It added the firm's nonpayment risk is escalating not only for the substantial public bond maturities in 2022, but also for its bank and trust loans and other debt liabilities over the next 12 months.
S&P estimated Evergrande has over 240 billion yuan ($37.14 billion) of bills and trade payables from contractors to settle over the next 12 months, of which around 100 billion yuan is due within 2021.
Increasing suppliers and contractors are suing Evergrande over late payments, and S&P said Evergrande might be persuading them to accept physical properties under presales as payments, citing market information, which also points to a deterioration of the company's liquidity position.
Shares of Evergrande in Hong Kong dropped as much as 7% on Friday morning to the lowest since January 2017.

Worries over the developer's financial health intensified after Evergrande admitted in June it had not paid some commercial paper on time, and news last week that a Chinese court had frozen a $20 million bank deposit held by the firm at the request of Guangfa Bank.

The company slid to a low of HK$78.60 in Hong Kong, adding to Thursday’s 15% wipeout, after the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily said in a commentary that Beijing should step up oversight of online platforms, particularly the way that anonymous social media users can band together to promote potentially undesirable content.
Kuaishou fell the most on record Thursday after a post-listing lockup on sales of its shares expired, underscoring the extent of investors’ fears about a widening Chinese online crackdown. Kuaishou joins rivals like Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. in a widespread market selloff this week, a wave of exits triggered by mounting uncertainty over the extent, direction and severity of Beijing’s widening clampdown on a plethora of online sectors.
Beijing’s campaign to rein in its giant internet industry is entering its 10th month, a roller-coaster ordeal that’s prompting nervous investors to ponder the longer-term ramifications of a crackdown on firms from Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to food delivery giant Meituan and ride-hailing leader Didi Global Inc.

Those actions demonstrated Beijing’s resolve to go after private enterprises to address social inequities, seize control of data it deems crucial to the economy and stability, and rein in powerful interests. Almost unnoticed amid a flurry of reports this week about gaming addiction was a Xinhua News Agency report outlining how regulators will soon step up oversight of how online media employ algorithms to promote content -- a key aspect of services operated by Kuaishou and ByteDance Ltd., among others.
Internet platforms should make efforts to promote a “healthy fan culture” among youths because insufficient oversight has encouraged improper activities, the People’s Daily wrote Friday. Some websites use algorithms and big data to create idols, then encourage fans to spend money, the newspaper said without naming any services.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 08:51PM ET</span>",Biden seeks to make half of new U.S. auto fleet electric by 2030,"By David Shepardson and Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden took a step toward his goal of slashing greenhouse gas emissions on Thursday with an executive order aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric, a move made with backing from the biggest U.S. automakers.
The administration also proposed new vehicle emissions standards that would cut pollution through 2026, starting with a 10% stringency increase in the 2023 model year.
The actions are part of Biden's broader plan to fight climate change, in this case by targeting emissions from cars and trucks, while working to make the United States an industry leader as China moves to dominate the electric vehicle market.
""The biggest thing that’s happening here is there’s a realization, on the part of both labor and business now, that this is the future. We can’t sit by,"" Biden told reporters at the White House.
The 50% target, which is not legally binding, won the support of U.S. and foreign automakers, which said that achieving it would require billions of dollars in government funding.
An environmental group, the Safe Climate Transport Campaign, said the White House did not go far enough and called automakers' commitment to a non-binding target unreliable.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV said in a joint statement they aspired ""to achieve sales of 40-50% of annual U.S. volumes of electric vehicles ... by 2030."" Reuters reported the planned automaker announcement on Tuesday.
The goals of both Biden and the automakers include battery electric, fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles that also have a gasoline engine.
Biden has repeatedly resisted calls from many Democrats to set a binding requirement for EV adoption or to follow California and some countries in setting 2035 as a date to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles in the face of opposition by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.
UAW President Ray Curry, who attended the event, noted the EV goal but said the union was focused ""on preserving the wages and benefits that have been the heart and soul of the American middle class.""
After signing the executive order on the South Lawn of the White House, Biden jumped into a waiting EV Jeep, which he proceeded to drive rapidly around the grounds.
MIXED REACTION
Senator Gary Peters of Michigan agreed with Biden's decision not to set a hard deadline for phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles. ""Flexibility is important ... but at the same token you need to set ambitious goals,"" he said. 
The executive order sets a schedule for developing new emissions standards through at least 2030 for light-duty vehicles and as early as 2027 for larger vehicles.
Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign, criticized the plan. “Voluntary pledges from auto companies make a New Year’s resolution to lose weight look like a legally binding contract,” he said.
General Motors Chief Executive Mary Barra and Ford CEO Jim Farley were among those in attendance.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO Elon Musk, whose company makes EVs, tweeted early on Thursday: ""Seems odd that Tesla wasn’t invited."" 
Asked whether the White House did not invite Musk because Tesla is not a union shop, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: ""I'll let you draw your own conclusion.""
The Detroit 3 automakers said the aggressive EV sales goals can only be met with billions of dollars in government incentives including consumer subsidies, EV charging networks as well as ""investments in R&D, and incentives to expand the electric vehicle manufacturing and supply chains in the United States.""
Hyundai said it supports the 2030 40-50% EV sales goal, while Nissan (OTC:NSANY) said it has a target that more than 40% of its U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 be EVs.
Toyota in a statement called the goal ""great for the environment"" and said it would ""do our part.""
Meanwhile, U.S. regulators plan to propose revising former President Donald Trump's March 2020 rollback of fuel economy standards to a 1.5% annual increase in efficiency through 2026.
Biden's proposed rules, which cover 2023-2026, are expected to be similar in overall vehicle emissions reductions to California's 2019 deal with some automakers aiming to improve fuel economy 3.7% annually through 2026, sources told Reuters.
BMW, Honda, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Ford and Volvo Cars - which previously struck the California deal - said in a joint statement they support the administration's EV goal but the federal government must take ""bold action ... to build consumer demand.""

Consulting firm AlixPartners in June said investments in EVs by 2025 could total $330 billion. EVs now represent about 2% of total global vehicle sales and will be about 24% of total sales by 2030, it forecast.
Biden has called for $174 billion in government spending to boost EVs, including $100 billion in consumer incentives. A bipartisan Senate infrastructure bill includes $7.5 billion for EV charging stations but nothing for new consumer incentives.

620,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 07:55PM ET</span>",Apple to check iCloud photo uploads for child abuse images,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -Apple Inc on Thursday said it will implement a system that checks photos on iPhones in the United States before they are uploaded to its iCloud storage services to ensure the upload does not match known images of child sexual abuse.
Detection of child abuse image uploads sufficient to guard against false positives will trigger a human review of and report of the user to law enforcement, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said. It said the system is designed to reduce false positives to one in one trillion.
Apple's new system seeks to address requests from law enforcement to help stem child sexual abuse while also respecting privacy and security practices that are a core tenet of the company's brand. But some privacy advocates said the system could open the door to monitoring of political speech or other content on iPhones.
Most other major technology providers - including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) - are already checking images against a database of known child sexual abuse imagery. 
""With so many people using Apple products, these new safety measures have lifesaving potential for children who are being enticed online and whose horrific images are being circulated in child sexual abuse material,"" John Clark, chief executive of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, said in a statement. ""The reality is that privacy and child protection can co-exist.""
Here is how Apple's system works. Law enforcement officials maintain a database of known child sexual abuse images and translate those images into ""hashes"" - numerical codes that positively identify the image but cannot be used to reconstruct them. 
Apple has implemented that database using a technology called ""NeuralHash"", designed to also catch edited images similar to the originals. That database will be stored on iPhones. 
When a user uploads an image to Apple's iCloud storage service, the iPhone will create a hash of the image to be uploaded and compare it against the database. 
Photos stored only on the phone are not checked, Apple said, and human review before reporting an account to law enforcement is meant to ensure any matches are genuine before suspending an account. 
Apple said users who feel their account was improperly suspended can appeal to have it reinstated.
The Financial Times earlier reported some aspects of the program.
One feature that sets Apple's system apart is that it checks photos stored on phones before they are uploaded, rather than checking the photos after they arrive on the company's servers. 
On Twitter, some privacy and security experts expressed concerns the system could eventually be expanded to scan phones more generally for prohibited content or political speech.
Apple has ""sent a very clear signal. In their (very influential) opinion, it is safe to build systems that scan users’ phones for prohibited content,"" Matthew Green, a security researcher at Johns Hopkins University, warned. 
""This will break the dam — governments will demand it from everyone.""
Other privacy researchers such as India McKinney and Erica Portnoy of the Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote in a blog post that it may be impossible for outside researchers to double check whether Apple keeps its promises to check only a small set of on-device content. 

The move is ""a shocking about-face for users who have relied on the company’s leadership in privacy and security,"" the pair wrote.
""At the end of the day, even a thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor is still a backdoor,"" McKinney and Portnoy wrote.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA said on Thursday it has hired JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) as adviser to sell its stake in petrochemical company  Braskem  SA (NYSE:BAK), confirming an earlier Reuters report.
Earlier on Thursday, Petrobras executives said in a conference call with investors that it had hired advisers to sell its stake in Braskem, without elaborating.
Brazilian conglomerate Novonor, formerly known as Odebrecht, resumed the sale of its controlling stake in Braskem in April, but so far it has not found a buyer. 
Still,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Novonor's adviser, has received bids for some of Braskem's assets. The company has plants in Brazil, Mexico and in the United States.
Given the complexity of selling units to different buyers, Petrobras has decided to hire an adviser to analyze potential deals.

Petrobras, which is also interested in selling its stake in the company, has favored a sale through a share offering, but Novonor, as a controlling shareholder, prefers an acquisition because it seeks a premium for its voting shares.
Two years ago, a deal to sell Braskem to  LyondellBasell Industries  (NYSE:LYB) BV failed as Braskem faced environmental problems related to its mining activities in the northeastern city of Maceio.

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed at record levels on Thursday after a spate of strong corporate earnings and a further decline in U.S. unemployment claims last week, as investors weighed concerns of the surge of the Delta variant ahead of Friday's job's report. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 14,000 to 385,000 in the week ended July 31, while layoffs dropped to their lowest level in more than 21 years last month as companies held on to their workers amid a labor shortage, the Labor Department's report showed.
""The directional change has continued to be improving in the last few weeks and now it's a new low since beginning the pandemic,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta, Georgia. ""I think that's what (is) kind of leading to some optimism today and earnings to this point have been positive."" 
Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes rose, with healthcare stocks in the red as  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) slipped 10.9% after predicting a bigger hit to full-year earnings from the pandemic.
Focus will now shift to the jobs report for July on Friday. Analysts say a disappointing number might raise questions about an economic recovery, but it could also lead the Federal Reserve to remain accommodative.
Meanwhile,  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) tumbled 27.6%, snapping a four-day rally fueled by interest from retail traders.
ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc jumped 7.1% as the company said it signed up the highest number of new streaming subscribers in the second quarter, and struck a multi-year deal with Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Sky to launch the Paramount+ streaming service in Europe.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 271.58 points, or 0.78%, to 35,064.25, the S&P 500 gained 26.44 points, or 0.60%, to 4,429.1 and the Nasdaq Composite added 114.58 points, or 0.78%, to 14,895.12.
Concerns about the pace of economic growth and higher inflation have pressured the S&P 500 index, but stellar corporate earnings so far have put it on track to end the week higher. 
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, a major architect of the central bank's new policy strategy, said on Wednesday he felt the conditions for raising interest rates could be met by the end of 2022.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.86 billion shares, compared with the 9.63 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.26-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 52 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 103 new lows.

(Reuters) - Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc said on Thursday that restaurants are placing ""more conservative"" orders for its plant-based burgers due to uncertainty over to the Delta variant of the coronavirus, leading the company to forecast third quarter revenue below estimates. 
Shares of the California-based company fell nearly 5% in extended trading.
""Given the recent uptick of COVID-19 cases, which could disrupt demand patterns, we believe caution for the balance of the year generally remains appropriate,"" Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said in a statement. 
The company said it expects third-quarter net revenue of $120 million to $140 million, substantially lower than analysts' estimates of $153.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Widespread labor pressure delayed at least one product launch until the first part of next year, Brown said during a call with analysts.
Restaurants are placing ""more conservative"" orders due to their own staffing challenges and uncertainty about the Delta variant, which has also prompted European operators to pause or cancel promotions, Brown said.
In the second quarter ended July 3, the faux beef and chicken maker reported that sales in restaurants, dining halls and other food service venues were finally back in growth mode after taking a big hit during the pandemic, when dining rooms shuttered and restaurants streamlined menus.
Increased restaurant sales drove overall net revenues up 31.8% to $149.4 million in the second quarter, exceeding estimates of $140.8 million.
Even so, Beyond Meat also reported a bigger-than-expected loss, with earnings per share of negative $0.31 versus estimates of minus $0.24.
It also saw Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) drop its Beyond Sausage sandwich at most locations as chains simplified menus, though it launched new dishes with Panda Restaurant Group, A&W Canada, Pizza Hut in the UK and KFC in China.

It revamped its faux hamburger product and brought back a chicken offering with the launch of plant-based chicken tenders in July.
Retail sales rose in international markets but fell 14% in the United States from the same quarter last year, when Americans hoarded groceries as lockdowns spread.

""We're seeing a strong surge in the Delta variant, especially in Southeast Asia... and so all the governments are responding with various lockdown measures,"" Sun Life Asia President Leo Grepin said on an analyst call on Thursday. ""That obviously creates some uncertainty for us heading into Q3.""
Manulife Asia CEO Anil Wadhwani said earlier on an analyst teleconference that the resurgence of COVID-19, particularly in Southeast Asian markets where it has a presence, was presenting ""momentum challenges.""
Both companies, however, said they remain confident in the region, where they have been expanding more rapidly than in other geographies. Manulife said it remains optimistic about medium-to-longer-term growth opportunities, while Sun Life's Grepin expressed confidence about the company's positioning due to investments in distribution and technology. 
The resurgence in cases and the spread of the Delta variant has been concentrated mostly in developing countries with large unvaccinated populations, so areas of the business outside of Asia are less affected, said incoming Sun Life CEO Kevin Strain, who takes over from Dean Connor when he retires on Friday.
Despite the change of guard, Strain said he will continue the focus on advancing a digital strategy, sustainability and diversity. 
""It's a matter of intensifying versus changing"" focus, he said in an interview on Thursday. 
Both Manulife and Sun Life beat estimates for second-quarter core profit on Wednesday, helped by their asset management units and new business and insurance sales, particularly in Asia.

Manulife shares rose 1.8% to close at C$24.56 on Thursday in Toronto, while Sun Life shares fell 0.5% to C$64.72 in a broader market up up 0.2%. 
CIBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Holden wrote in a note that both insurers reported ""solid"" results, although the bulk of the earnings per share upside at Sun Life came from lower taxes and technical factors, including ""experience gains"" which is the difference between the actual profit and the one based on actuarial profit estimates.

626,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 06:06PM ET</span>",U.S. EPA shoots to push vehicle fuel efficiency to 52 mpg by 2026,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's administration on Thursday said it would propose reversing the Trump-era loosening of vehicle emissions rules with a new plan to boost efficiency 10% in the 2023 model year and aiming for a fleet average of 52 miles per gallon by 2026.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposal also calls for a near 5% stringency increase in each model year from 2024 through 2026. But it would not seek to reverse former President Donald Trump's rollbacks in fuel efficiency standards for the 2021 or 2022 model years.
The plan is a big increase from Trump's proposal for vehicle fuel efficiency by 2026 of just 43.3 mpg. The Biden administration said EPA rules would require higher efficiency by 2026 than former President Barack Obama's administration would have mandated through 2025.
The Democratic administrations of Biden and Obama have pushed for stricter fuel efficiency standards to reduce greenhouse gas omissions and fight climate change. In March 2020, Trump's Republican administration rolled back Obama's standards to require only 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026. Obama had required 5% annual increases.
The EPA said through the 2026 model year ""the new vehicle fleet likely will continue to consist primarily of gasoline-fueled vehicles."" It estimates electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric will account for 8% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2026.
The EPA projects the requirements will cost $150 billion to $240 billion through 2025 from higher vehicle costs, but save motorists $120 billion to $250 billion in fuel costs and have net benefits of $86 billion to $140 billion including other things like improved public health and reduced pollution.
EPA said by 2050 the proposal would ""reduce gasoline consumption by more than 290 million barrels"" a nearly 10% reduction.
In 2020, the EPA said the Trump plan would hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day.
The EPA assumes that under the rule Americans will drive 449 billion more miles, up 0.5% as the costs of driving declines due to the improvement in fuel economy, 
EPA estimates that over 30 years ""total 
fatalities will increase by 2,288, with 1,952 deaths attributed to increased driving and 336 deaths attributed to the increase in fatality risk.""
The transportation sector is the largest U.S. source of greenhouse emissions, representing 29% of total emissions -- and light-duty vehicles account for 58% of the transportation emissions.
The EPA also proposes to restore the advanced technology vehicle multiplier credits ""to encourage manufacturers to accelerate the introduction of zero and near-zero emissions vehicles"" and restore the 2012 rule’s ""full-size pickup truck incentives for strong hybrids"" through 2025.
It would also boost ""off-cycle"" credits that recognize the emissions benefits of technologies that are not captured on the EPA compliance tests. ""These include technologies such as 

high-efficiency headlamps or solar reflective paint that keeps the vehicle cabin cooler to reduce air conditioning needs,"" EPA said.
EPA plans a public hearing on Aug. 25 and public comments must be received by Sept. 27.

Corteva forecast 2021 net sales between $15.2 billion and $15.4 billion, versus an earlier estimate of $14.6 billion to $14.8 billion. Analysts were expecting $14.82 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
Net sales rose 8.4% to $5.63 billion in the second quarter, surpassing an estimate of $5.33 billion, while total crop protection sales jumped about 12% to $1.85 billion due to demand for its new products including Arylex herbicide and Pyraxalt insecticide.
Seed sales rose 7% to $3.78 billion in the quarter thanks to increased soybean acreage in North America and higher volumes on the back of more normalized delivery timing in the region.

The Wilmington, Delaware-based company said operating earnings per share rose to $1.04 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $944 million, or $1.26 per share, last year.

In a regulatory filing https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-21-015656 submitted Thursday the company registered for the sale of up to 97.9 million of shares by early shareholders and noted that the company will not receive any of the proceeds. The filing angered some retail investors, who groused in online forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets.
The potential future share sales, which depend on meeting certain stock performance targets, were outlined in the company's IPO prospectus https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021015076/robinhood424.htm#ib5a32e8afc3b422193a2f2891a49e0c9_895filed in early July. 
But still, the filing may have prompted some traders to take profits after the stock’s blistering four-day run, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""Whether it's existing shareholders being able to sell is new news or not, it appears to be news to the people who pushed its stock up to $85 on Wednesday,"" he said. 
Robinhood has become a focus of retail traders, joining the ranks of other so-called ""meme stocks"", a term applied to GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Corp and other companies whose shares have experienced wild trading this year, spurred in part by individual investors coordinating online. 
On Thursday, shares of Robinhood were the most traded among clients of Fidelity’s online brokerage, with buys outpacing sales. Robinhood also topped the list of the most mentioned stocks on Reddit's WallStreetBets for a second straight day, according to sentiment tracker SwaggyStocks. 
Buying from retail investors has ramped up in recent days, and may be an important factor in propelling the stock higher, analysts at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research said in a report.
Robinhood’s shares have seen $100 million in retail purchases this week, Vanda Research said in a note Thursday morning. By comparison, shares of video game retailer GameStop saw $352 million worth of buying during the stock’s January rally, when they rose by more than 1,600%, and $600 million for AMC, when the stock rose more than 500% in a rally later in the year. 
“If retail investors start withdrawing money from tired meme stocks to buy HOOD, there is still room for the move to continue,” Vanda’s analysts wrote.

Wednesday also marked the first day that investors could trade options on Robinhood, giving them another way to bet on the stock. Options trading by retail investors has helped fuel big moves in shares of GameStop, AMC and other stocks this year. 
Robinhood's options market debut drew trading volume of about 323,000 contracts on Wednesday - making it the second most heavily traded options market debut in history after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), according to Trade Alert.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc on Thursday said it would not expect U.S. corporate employees to return to the office until next year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Seattle-based company said it was extending its work-from-home period to Jan. 3, 2022, from its earlier guidance of Sept. 7 for the United States and other countries it did not name, according to an internal note seen by Reuters.
""As we continue to closely watch local conditions related to COVID-19, we are adjusting our guidance for corporate employees,"" the note said.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) told Reuters its employees' health was its top priority and it will keep adhering to local government guidance for a safe office return. It said it will require masks in offices except for staff who verify they are fully vaccinated.
A spike in COVID-19 infections, powered by the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus, has prompted some big companies to put off plans to reopen offices. The United States is reporting the highest daily average number of infections globally, at 94,819, according to data gathered by Reuters.
Last week, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said https://www.reuters.com/world/us/google-will-require-covid-19-vaccine-us-employees-step-into-campuses-2021-07-28 it would extend its work-from-home policy through Oct. 18,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said it would require vaccinations for U.S. employees in offices, and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said it would close workspaces it already had reopened.
Amazon's action a week after announcements from its peers offers a look into evolving safety protocols during the pandemic as well as the battle for tech talent.

The company earlier this year said it planned an ""office-centric culture,"" but it soon updated guidance to requiring in-person work three days a week, facing competition from startups and others offering more flexible schedules.
The latest guidance from the world's largest online retailer does not pertain to warehouse and delivery operations staff, which make up the majority of its workforce. Amazon has more than 1.3 million full- and part-time employees globally.

634,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 05:02PM ET</span>",Federal Reserve announces new capital ratios for large banks following stress test,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Thursday how much each large bank that underwent the most recent stress test will have to hold on their books as capital cushions.
The capital requirements for each of the 34 banks are based on how well each firm performed in the June test, and will take effect on Oct. 1. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were directed to hold the largest amount of capital to guard against losses, facing ratios of 13.4% and 13.2%, respectively.
The ratios are part of the new ""stress capital buffer"" regime established by the Fed, which allows the central bank to set custom capital requirements for each bank, depending on how severely each firm faced losses under the annual stress test.

The June results found that even in a severe downturn, banks would have more than enough capital to stay above regulatory minimums - a finding that led the Fed to lift restrictions on stock buybacks and dividend payouts that had been put in place at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.
The new capital requirement combines the 4.5% minimum capital ratio for all large banks with a custom stress capital buffer. HSBC's North American operation faced the largest such requirement, with the Fed ordering a 7.5% buffer. The nation's largest firms also face a G-SIB surcharge of at least 1%, which scales up to 3.5% for JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), the nation's largest bank.

BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. stocks and oil prices rebounded sharply on Thursday as unemployment claims declined and the trade deficit widened - positive economic data in the face of rising COVID-19 cases and signals of declining Federal Reserve stimulus. 
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits declined further last week, while layoffs dropped in July to their lowest level in just more than 21 years.
The U.S. trade deficit surged to a record high in June as businesses boosted imports to rebuild inventories.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 271.58 points, or 0.78%, to 35,064.25, the S&P 500 gained 26.46 points, or 0.60%, to 4,429.12 and the Nasdaq Composite added 114.58 points, or 0.78%, to 14,895.12.
""Yesterday's record high reading on the Services PMI and today's unemployment claims data have reinvigorated confidence on the economic growth front,"" Dave Donabedian, chief investment officer of $92 billion CIBC Private Wealth U.S., wrote in an email. 
A measure of U.S. services industry activity jumped to a record high in July, boosted by the shift in spending to services from goods.
""Investors definitely are keeping an eye on the Delta variant, but mostly view it as a speed bump for the economy rather than a showstopper,"" Donabedian said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) market strategists raised their year-end and 2022 price targets for the S&P 500 Index, citing ""the combination of higher-than-expected S&P 500 earnings and lower-than-expected interest rates.""
Still, investors want to know how low rates will stay, and for how long. 
On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida, a major architect of the Fed's new strategy, said he felt conditions for raising interest rates could be met by the end of 2022, raising expectations that the central bank could scale back its bond-buying program soon. 
A key indicator is due on Friday with the U.S. non-farm payrolls report, seen as key to the U.S. central bank's policy stance.
""Everyone is on pins and needles waiting for tomorrow's jobs report, which will clearly dictate how the markets close out the week,"" Michael S. Harris of Verdence Capital Advisors in Hunt Valley, Maryland, wrote in an email. 
The dollar held gains against a basket of currencies after Clarida's hawkish remarks, trading around 92.258 after hitting an eight-day high of 92.352.
Traders sent U.S. Treasury yields higher on Thursday as risk sentiment improved after the healthy jobless claims report and ahead of the more detailed employment data.
Benchmark 10-year notes last yielded 1.2235%, up from 1.184% late on Wednesday.
Oil prices rose more than 1% on increasing Middle East tensions.

U.S. crude rose 1.41% to $69.11 per barrel and Brent was at $71.25, up 1.24% on the day.
Gold fell to test the pivotal $1,800 support level, with spot gold dropping 0.4% to $1,803.97 an ounce.

The FAA said planes may have a failed electronic flow control of the air conditioning packs that vent air into the cargo hold from other areas of the plane. The directive prohibits operators from transporting cargo in the cargo hold if airplanes are operating with this condition unless they can verify items are nonflammable and noncombustible. 
The FAA said the directive covers all Boeing 737 8, 737 9, and 737 8200 MAX airplanes and some 737-800 and 737-900ER series airplanes.
Boeing did not immediately comment.

The airworthiness directive impacts 663 airplanes registered in the United States and approximately 2,204 worldwide.
Operators must comply with this directive beginning 10 days after date of publication.

However, as the industry struggles with raw material shortages and supply chain constraints, we think overvalued stocks Sunnova (NOVA), Beam Global (BEEM), and Solar Integrated Roofing (SIRC) are best avoided now. Read on for a closer look at these names.While significant emphasis is being placed on almost all clean energy sources globally, the solar power segment is attracting much investor attention and capital investments. Government incentives and declining installation and maintenance costs are also driving the solar energy market, which is expected to grow at a 20.5% CAGR over the next five years to $223.30 billion by 2026.
The industry is expected to remain constrained by the impact of supply chain bottlenecks and equipment shortages over the next few years, however. Furthermore, a global semiconductor chip shortage is affecting the industry’s production targets because semiconductors are a crucial component in battery storage and solar inverters.
So, although the solar industry’s long-term outlook remains bright, we think its bleak short-term growth prospects make highly overvalued stocks  Sunnova Energy International Inc . (NYSE:NOVA), Beam Global (BEEM), and Solar Integrated Roofing Corporation (SIRC) best avoided now.

The U.S. insurer posted underwriting income of $463 million in its general insurance business in the quarter, compared with a loss of $343 million a year earlier, when it booked large losses related to the pandemic.
The business saw $118 million of catastrophe losses, compared to $674 million in the prior year.
Global insurers last year faced a sharp rise in payouts related to the health crisis, but many have now seen a fall in coronavirus-related claims as vaccines roll out.
Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG's common shareholders rose to $1.33 billion in the quarter ended June 30, from $561 million a year earlier.
Excluding items, AIG earned $1.52 per share, exceeding analysts' estimates of $1.20, according to Refinitiv IBES.
The company's general insurance accident year combined ratio - which excludes catastrophe losses - was 91.1 for the quarter, compared with 94.9 a year earlier.
A ratio below 100 means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.
Gross premiums written rose 12% to $9.5 billion in the general insurance business.
AIG's life and retirement unit posted a 26% jump in adjusted pre-tax income to $1.12 billion, driven partly by higher private equity returns.
The life insurance business reported an adjusted pre-tax profit of $20 million, compared to $2 million a year earlier, largely reflecting fewer deaths from the virus outbreak.

AIG plans to use an initial public offering to sell part of its life and retirement business, while Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) last month agreed to buy a sizeable stake.
AIG said on Thursday that it believes the IPO is the next step in the separation.

Consumer discretionary stocks were also in the ascendency, led by a surge in casino stocks following better-than-expected quarterly results from Wynn and MGM, while a surge in Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) after it signed a deal to acquire Score Media and Gaming also boosted the sector.
Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) were up 8% and 6% after reporting quarterly results that surprised to the upside.

The overweight call translates to bullish bets on Egypt and Indonesia's state-owned electric utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).

Investing.com -- Stocks bounced back on Thursday, buoyed by data that said fewer people filed for unemployment benefits last week, a sign of progress in the labor market ahead of Friday’s big jobs report.
Initial jobless claims fell by 14,000 to 385,000 in the week ended July 31, and layoffs dropped to their lowest level in more than 21 years.
Friday’s jobs report for July has been on investors’ minds all week. A weak number might raise questions about the economic recovery but be evidence for the Federal Reserve that it doesn’t have to move off its easy money policy soon.
 Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) tumbled 20% after reaching $85 a share on Wednesday. The selloff was sparked when the company announced some of its early investors would sell more than 97 million of stock over time.
Apart from the jobs report, it looks like Friday will be a typical quiet summer day for markets. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Theater earnings
Movie theaters are trying to come back from the pandemic, when they were forced to shut down. But rising Covid cases are not helping them. There is also the competition from streaming as Hollywood studios push their new films on their own platforms at the same time as releasing them into theaters. Cinemark Holdings Inc (NYSE:CNK)reports its latest quarterly results on Friday. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect it to announce a loss per share of $1.11 on revenue of $250.76 million.
2. Gambling results

3. Jobs, jobs, jobs
As previously mentioned, Friday brings us the government’s report on employment for July. The trend is expected to build on the improvement seen a month earlier. According to estimates, nonfarm payrolls in the U.S. are expected to rise by 870,000 in July, more than June’s 850,000 and May’s 583,000. The report is due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).

Another factor that is driving the increase in the number of active investors is the underlying volatility in the stock markets all over the world due to the ongoing pandemic and the spectacular snapback rally witnessed in the aftermath of the bear market of early 2020.
This makes publicly-listed brokers an attractive option for investors. Today I’ll analyze 2 such brokers, Robinhood (HOOD) with an established player like Fidelity (FIS), to see which stock is a better buy.

TORONTO (Reuters) -TMX Group shares jumped to their highest level in over a year on Thursday after the Canadian exchange operator reported second-quarter profit that beat analysts' expectations late on Wednesday and said the pipeline for capital raisings has not slowed during the summer.
With Canadian shares setting new records this year, TMX saw capital raisings hit a new high of C$34.7 billion ($27.8 billion) in the first-half, or double from a year ago period.
TMX Group exchanges had 155 new listings in the first half, second only to the Nasdaq, and 21 new international listings, after the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, according to World Federation of Exchanges data.
Revenue growth, which helped lift second-quarter earnings, was largely driven by a 44% jump by new listings, with smaller contributions from its equities and fixed income trading and clearing business and data and analytics unit, the company said.
""This is the best capital raising market we've had in history,"" TMX Chief Executive John McKenzie said in an interview on Thursday, referring to the first half of 2021. ""If you look at the traction that these companies get after they go public, the majority of them are seeing share price appreciation,"" he said.
The company expects continued strength in its capital raisings business, as, contrary to expectations, the pipeline for new issuances has not slowed during the summer, the executives said on an analyst call on Thursday.
The shares climbed 3.6% to C$141.12 in afternoon trading in Toronto, the highest intraday level since July 2020. They are up 11% this year, compared with a gain of 3.2% for the Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) and a 17.1% decline for the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG).
TMX saw total trading volumes up 37% in the second quarter versus two years ago, helped by higher activity by retail investors, although they were off from the first-quarter peak.
Volumes in its retail investor-driven Venture and Alpha exchanges were up 60% and 80% respectively from two years earlier, the company said.
""Where we normalize, I can't predict,"" McKenzie said. 
But easier-to-access trading platforms and the availability of products like bitcoin exchange-traded funds that will continue to exist post-pandemic ""give me confidence that we should continue to see higher levels of activity than we had pre-pandemic,"" he said.

Adjusted earnings per share climbed to C$1.90 in the three months through June from C$1.52 a year earlier, the company said in a statement on Wednesday, beating estimates of C$1.72.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 03:19PM ET</span>",Boeing to spin off venture capital arm,"By Tim Hepher, Eric M. Johnson and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Thursday it plans to spin off its venture capital arm, HorizonX, to forge a broader external investment fund, in a deal said by sources to value the unit at several hundred million dollars.
Under the deal, AE Industrial Partners (AEI), a specialist private equity firm, will add fresh capital to the portfolio born out of Boeing's decision to set up its own venture fund in 2017.
""The partnership with AEI and future partners broadens our investor base, enables HorizonX to invest at a rapid pace and gives Boeing access to more outside innovation than ever through this investment collaboration,” Boeing Chief Strategy Officer Marc Allen said in a statement.
The move accelerates efforts by Boeing to deepen the pipeline of technology available to the U.S. aerospace giant, and will ease the burden of supporting future growth of HorizonX, which has invested in more than a dozen companies.
HorizonX ""needs to go faster and needs a bigger capital pile to invest in more companies,"" a person familiar with the deal said.
Boeing will remain a strategic investor with a ""significant majority"" stake in the initial fund to be created from the spinoff, which is expected to be named AE HorizonX, the person said.
It will continue to hold smaller stakes in any follow-on funds bringing in more entrepreneurial capital.
Under the deal, Boeing will contribute the HorizonX portfolio, valued by industry sources at several hundred million dollars. It will also provide a specialist industrial perspective and receive preferential access to innovations developed by portfolio companies.
Boeing is among several aerospace groups that have until now sought to keep complete control of efforts to develop technology through in-house venture funds.
But analysts have questioned the ability of traditional aerospace firms to provide the increasing amounts of time and capital needed to generate meaningful advances in technologies like robotics and mobility.
""The main question is how you deal with scale,"" an industry source said.
Boeing additionally faces pressure on its balance sheet from some $60 billion in debt accumulated as the company grappled with a nearly two-year safety ban of its 737 MAX, compounded by the coronavirus pandemic.
Boca Raton, Florida-based AE Industrial Partners manages more than $3 billion of equity capital with a focus on aerospace and defense, according to its website.
Boeing launched HorizonX in 2017 as an ""innovation cell focused on accelerating potentially transformative aerospace technologies,"" and at one time said its investments would total tens of millions of dollars per year.
Among HorizonX's investments was a $20 million stake in Richard Branson's suborbital tourism venture Virgin Galactic, which flew the billionaire British businessman to the edge of space last month.

Boeing also invested in the now-collapsed hybrid-electric planemaker Zunum Aero.
Some industry officials expect more joint ventures and financial partnerships as aerospace companies tackle challenges such as the decarbonization of aviation and a digital revolution in manufacturing.

""We have begun to see the return of long-term LNG contracts in support of the construction of new liquefaction capacity,"" Cheniere Chief Executive Jack Fusco told analysts on an earnings call.
So far in 2021, he said the company entered into sales agreements with multiple counterparties aggregating approximately 12 million tonnes of LNG to be delivered between 2021-2032.
Cheniere said the sixth liquefaction train at its Sabine Pass export plant in Louisiana was on track to enter commercial service in the first half of 2022. The unit will likely start producing LNG in test mode later this year.
Cheniere also said it continues to develop the Stage 3 expansion at its Corpus Christi plant in Texas.
Cheniere reported second quarter consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $1.023 billion and distributable cash flow of about $340 million on revenue of over $3 billion.
It posted a quarterly net loss of $329 million due primarily to accounting treatment of derivatives.
Cheniere increased its 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance to $4.6-$4.9 billion and 2021 distributable cash flow guidance to $1.8-$2.1 billion due primarily to improved LNG market margins and an increase in forecasted LNG production.
""Market dynamics on both the supply side and demand side continue to move in our favor and support our conviction in the long-term growth prospects for natural gas worldwide,"" Fusco said, noting LNG exports hit a quarterly record 139 cargoes.

Each of Cheniere's nine liquefaction trains, including Sabine 6, can produce about 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, or 0.66 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas.
Corpus Stage 3 is designed to produce over 10 MTPA.

The deal, which is expected to close in the second half of the year, comes a week after Thyssenkrupp sold its mining equipment business to Denmark's FLSmidth.
Both units are part of Thyssenkrupp's Multi Tracks division, which consists of businesses the steel-to-submarines group want to sell, restructure or close in a bid to focus on its most profitable divisions.
""With the successful sale of the Infrastructure business we are taking the next step in sharpening the portfolio of Multi Tracks and making a further contribution to the transformation of Thyssenkrupp,"" said Volkmar Dinstuhl, chief executive of Thyssenkrupp Multi Tracks.
""The high purchase interest underlines Infrastructure's leading product and service portfolio as well as the capabilities and expertise of its employees.""

Thyssenkrupp Infrastructure employs around 480 people and made 140 million euros ($166 million) in revenues in the 2019/2020 fiscal year, with products including flood protection and pile driving equipment as well as drilling and scaffolding systems.
The sale of infrastructure leaves Thyssenkrupp's Italian stainless steel unit AST as the only current disposal candidate within Multi Tracks. Thyssenkrupp last week said it was in discussions with several potential buyers for the unit.

Pirelli, the sole supplier of Formula One tyres, said it saw an overall impact this year from higher raw materials prices, which have been affecting manufacturers worldwide, worth 3% of its revenue.
""For the second half, we are expecting a much higher headwind because we see costs rising month after month,"" Pirelli's chief planning and control officer, Fabio Bocchio, told analysts.
But the price mix would allow the company ""to fully compensate"" the expected impact from raw materials, he said, as well as from foreign exchange in the second part of this year.
In the April-June period Pirelli's adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) rose to 208.6 million euros ($247 million) from a loss of 74.4 million euros a year earlier, topping a company-provided analyst consensus of earnings of 186 million euros.
An increase in raw material costs has weighed on Pirelli's quarterly operating profit for 28 million euros.
But the Milan-based company said better volumes, price mix and efficiencies more than offset a negative impact from external forces such as raw material price increases, inflation, and exchange rates so far this year.
Pirelli, which also manufactures tyres for high-end carmakers such as BMW and Audi, now sees 2021 revenue at 5.0 billion-5.1 billion euros, up from a previous forecast of 4.7 billion-4.8 billion. The margin on adjusted EBIT is now forecast at 15.0-15.5% from a previous 14-15%.

It also raised its forecast for its full-year net cash flow to 360 million-390 million euros from 300 million-340 million euros previously.
""We think that we will be able to stay in the higher part of our range,"" Bocchio said.

So, will the company be able to beat the Street’s expectations and deliver stellar financials in the about-to-be-reported quarter? Read more to find out.Diversified insurance provider American Insurance Group, Inc. (AIG) is scheduled to release its second-quarter (ended June 2021) results after the market closes today. Though analysts expect the company’s earnings to have improved 77.3% for the quarter due to improved retention and higher rates, its revenues are expected to have declined 2.5% year-over-year. The unfavorable investor sentiment surrounding this stock is evident in its 2% decline over the past month.
On July 16, AIG sold its AIG Life and Retirement’s Retail Mutual Funds business, with assets worth $6.80 billion, to Touchstone Investments. AIG announced its plans to sell its subsidiary in February, saying the unit was no longer aligned with its core offerings. And on July 15, AIG sold a 9.9% stake in its Life and Retirement business to Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) for $2.20 billion. AIG also entered into a long-term strategic asset management relationship with Blackstone, under which the latter is expected to manage $50 billion of AIG’s existing investment portfolio. The total assets managed are expected to increase to $92.50 billion over the next six years.
Regarding this, AIG President and CEO Peter Zaffino said, “Establishing a cornerstone partnership on several fronts with such a highly regarded organization as Blackstone validates the strength of our market-leading Life & Retirement business and provides it with additional growth opportunities, provides AIG with flexibility as we continue to work to separate Life & Retirement from AIG, and results in significant new capital for AIG to deploy to support our capital management priorities.”

(Reuters) -Many of Wall Street's biggest banks are sticking by their decision to make employees return to the office in the coming weeks even as public health officials' warnings about the aggressive Delta variant of the coronavirus are prompting some firms to rethink their plans.
The variant is sparking fears even among vaccinated professionals that they might be bringing home harm to unvaccinated children and others after a day at the office. This has created pressure for law firms, financial service companies and others to re-evaluate, lawyers, bankers and investment managers said.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co has pushed back its return-to-office date to Oct. 4 and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, is delaying its return date by one month, to October, representatives of the companies said. Law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer pushed its date to Oct. 11 from Sept. 13, it said. 
The shifts were announced this week amid growing concerns https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/global-covid-19-cases-surpass-200-mln-delta-variant-spreads-2021-08-04 over increased danger due to the new variant.
""By making us come back to the office, you are essentially putting our families and children at risk,"" said one person on a financial services company's firm-wide conference call where employees could ask questions and air potential grievances about returning to the office, according to another participant who was on the call and spoke with Reuters.
MANHATTAN OR THE SUBURBS?
Wall Street employers are divided on the issue. After hastily adapting to working remotely as the pandemic spread last year, many firms are ready to bring their staff back, if only for a portion of the week. For many that means a return to commuter trains and high-rise office buildings' elevators starting next month.
But some are now resisting, arguing that life in the suburbs can be just as productive for business as it is for life after hours. Indeed the New York suburbs are quickly developing into outposts to do business deals whether at outdoor restaurants, the beach or a lake, people said.
""A lot of people are not commuting into the city right now and so the New York suburbs have become a new meeting place that never existed before but where you can efficiently arrange a lot of face-to-face meetings now,"" said Jonathan Litt, whose hedge fund Land & Buildings Investment Management concentrates on real estate. 
""You drive 10 minutes, have lunch and then you go home,"" said Litt, whose hedge fund moved out of Manhattan to nearby Connecticut more than a decade ago. 
Some lawyers and bankers have told colleagues they would not be returning to their Manhattan offices in the foreseeable future for fear of catching the highly transmissible new strain and carrying it home to children under the age of 12 who have not been cleared to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.
MOOD CHANGE
Some of the bankers, lawyers and investment managers who spoke to Reuters said the mood among many parents of young children has changed in the last few days. It is the latest twist in a saga that began with many professionals fleeing their New York offices in March 2020 only to make a tentative return earlier this summer.
The shift coincides with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's call on Tuesday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nyc-require-proof-vaccination-indoor-activities-mayor-2021-08-03 that all people who wish to eat indoors at restaurants, exercise at gyms or see performances in New York must soon show that they have been vaccinated.
""I thought we were past this and things were getting better, but they are clearly not,"" said another executive, who like the half dozen contacted for this story asked not to be identified for fear of angering his employer.
At the major banks, the policy for now is to adhere to the previously charted course, with some taking a harder stance on vaccines.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s staff and clients will not be allowed to enter the bank's New York offices if they are not fully vaccinated, a source said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has had a vaccine status reporting requirement in place since June 10, a spokesperson said, adding that unvaccinated individuals are required to submit to regular, weekly testing and wear a mask.

A banker at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) told Reuters ""fear is rising,"" but speculated that the bank will not make any changes after CEO Jamie Dimon was among the first senior executives to bring back his workforce. JPMorgan declined to comment on any changes to its back-to-office plans. 
The largest U.S. bank has brought back employees in the United States to the office on a rotational basis from July.

The S&P 500 added 0.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.57%, or 197 points. and the Nasdaq was up 0.7%.
Ahead of the July nonfarm payrolls report, the latest U.S. jobless weekly claims data were in line with economists’ forecast.
Initial jobless claims for the week ended July 31st were 385,000, down 14,000 from the previous week. The data came a day after ADP reported private sector job gains that fell well short of estimates.
Despite the mixed picture on the jobs front, Wall Street continues to tout optimism ahead of the July jobs report.
“We forecast nonfarm payrolls rose 1025k in July following a 850k rise in June,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note. “We think payrolls in July were supported by favorable seasonal factors associated with education.”
Energy led the gains to the upside in the broader market as oil prices steadied from their recent weakness.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also in the ascendency, led by a surge in casino stocks following better-than-expected quarterly results from Wynn and MGM, while a surge in Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) after it signed a deal to acquire Score Media and Gaming also boosted the sector.
Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) were up 7% and 5% after reporting quarterly results that surprised to the upside.
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) fell 2% as the streaming services device company's softer user growth numbers overshadowed quarterly results that fell short of expectations. Still, Wall Street remains bullish on Roku.

The comments and cautiously optimistic forecasts from two large U.S.-based insurers come as public health officials worldwide warn about COVID-19's aggressive Delta variant and concerns grow about areas with low vaccination rates.
MetLife (NYSE:MET) and Prudential (NYSE:PUK) can be seen as proxies for the labor market and are sensitive to interest rates and stock market movements, said Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at CFRA. 
""The macroeconomic impact from COVID has lessened,"" she said. MetLife's large employee benefits business offers a way ""to leverage an improvement in employment levels.""
The pandemic is still costing insurers. MetLife said its U.S. group business took a $75 million hit from claims related to the health crisis.
""Our results show that COVID-19 is both still with us but lessening in its impact,"" MetLife Chief Executive Officer Michel Khalaf said on a conference call on Thursday.
Prudential executives said on Wednesday that while the pandemic had affected results, the impact was ""beginning to moderate"" and that people with insurance are more likely to be vaccinated. 
""We believe that the vaccination rate of the insured population is higher than the general population,"" Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Tanji said on a conference call.
MetLife on Wednesday reported adjusted second-quarter profits that blew past Wall Street estimates, as strong investment gains, especially private equity, helped offset the costs of coronavirus-related claims. 
Prudential posted strong results on Tuesday.

In MetLife's U.S. group insurance unit, the lower impact of COVID-19 helped produce a 39% sales rise in the first half, and Khalaf predicted record sales for the year ""if current trends hold.""

662,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>",Delta Impact Increasingly Threatens Some Parts of U.S. Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- From event cancellations to consumer behavior, there are growing signs the coronavirus delta variant risks slowing the pace of the U.S. economic recovery.
Because any effect from the delta variant will take time to emerge in traditional monthly indicators, economists and policy makers are closely watching a mix of anecdotal and high-frequency data for any signs of impact.
Some events, like the New York International Auto Show, are being canceled due to virus concerns. Companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). have all recently pushed back plans to return to the office as well.
But trying to decipher the impact of delta from a plethora of other cross currents in the economy in high frequency data is challenging.
Total spending using Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). debit and credit cards “decelerated meaningfully” last week, economists Michelle Meyer and Anna Zhou wrote in a note Thursday.
While the moderation is likely partly noise -- reflecting the timing of the pay period and the mid-July boost from Child Tax Credit payments -- the pullback in spending on air travel and entertainment could be a result of the variant, the BofA economists wrote.
Looking at the U.S. as a whole, the improvement in OpenTable restaurant bookings has largely stalled in recent months, holding below its 2019 levels. But reservations in virus hot-spot states like Florida and Texas remain above levels seen during a comparable time frame in 2019.
Meanwhile, a back-to-work gauge from Kastle Systems, a company that tracks electronic access to office buildings, showed a slight pullback last week from its pandemic peak a week earlier. But it’s unclear whether that’s weekly volatility or the start of a broader trend.

Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet on Philip Morris (PM), ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), Norsk Hydro (OTC:NHYDY), and Aperam (APEMY (OTC:APEMY)), each of which possesses solid momentum attributes. Let’s discuss.The resurgence of COVID-19 cases due to the rapid spread of the virus’ highly contagious Delta variant has fueled severe stock market volatility. In addition, high inflation has been a concern for investors. The consumer price index increased 5.4% in June, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that inflation could be persistent.
The S&P 500 declined from a record high yesterday on a slowdown in job growth last month. Amid this scenario, momentum investing could help investors dodge short-term market volatility because stocks that have gained momentum will likely maintain it for some time irrespective of market conditions. Investors’ interest in momentum stocks is evident in the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF’s (MTUM) 5.3% gains over the past three months.
Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), ArcelorMittal (MT),  Norsk Hydro ASA  (NHYDY), and Aperam S.A.

So, we think it could be wise to scoop up quality airlines stocks  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) and  SkyWest  (NASDAQ:SKYW).Governments worldwide have reinstated lockdown and social distancing measures to limit the spread of the highly transmissible COVID-19 Delta variant. Nevertheless, most airline operators have been witnessing solid leisure travel demand of late.
Several airlines have been hiring pilots and other workers to meet a surge in demand. In addition, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is screening roughly two million passengers per day at airports. Furthermore, as more people get vaccinated, airline companies should continue witnessing increasing demand for their services.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound airline companies Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW). These two stocks look like bargains at their current prices, considering their immense growth potential.

665,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 01:22PM ET</span>",UniCredit target Monte dei Paschi tops profit forecast,"By Valentina Za and Andrea Mandala
MILAN (Reuters) -Monte dei Paschi (MPS) posted better-than-forecast quarterly results on Thursday, while delaying planned job cuts and reducing an expected capital shortfall as rival UniCredit evaluates buying the state-owned bank.
The Italian Treasury, which owns 64% of MPS after a 2017 bailout, last week entered into exclusive talks to sell the Tuscan lender to UniCredit. 
The draft accord caps a year of on-and-off talks that were complicated by a change of leadership at UniCredit, where former UBS investment banker Andrea Orcel took the reins in April.
Orcel has said a decision is expected by mid-September after setting strict terms to consider buying ""selected parts"" of MPS.
Siena-based MPS' second-quarter earnings confirmed an improving picture of lower loan losses and rebounding revenues for banks across Italy and Europe as the COVID-19 crisis eases.
MPS posted a higher-than-expected 83 million euro ($98 million) net profit for the April-June period, from an 842 million euro loss a year ago. Shares in MPS closed up 4.9%.
Italy's third-largest bank Banco BPM also swung to a second quarter profit, joining Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) and UniCredit, which have both lifted their full-year profit guidance, in exceeding forecasts.
By contrast, Genoa-based Carige on Thursday said it may report a bigger-than-expected full-year loss after a 50 million euro net loss in the first half.
MPS said it still planned to raise 2.5 billion euros in cash next year if it failed to secure a buyer, after a Europe-wide banking health check-up last week showed that its capital would be wiped out by a negative economic shock.
In the meantime, it said a projected capital shortfall had shrunk to less than 500 million euros from an original estimate of up to 1.5 billion euros.
That reflects measures such as buying protection against credit risks, as well as the postponement of proposed staff exits pending the talks with UniCredit.
""Whilst a potential acquisition from UniCredit appears as the likely structural solution ... MPS continues working on reducing the potential capital shortfall for 2022,"" DBRS Morningstar analyst Arnaud Journois said.
Job cuts are one of the focal points of the talks, with sources saying they could total almost a third of MPS' 21,000 staff.
Pledging to defend workers and Siena's local economy, Economy Minister Daniele Franco on Wednesday ruled out delaying the sale, rebuffing calls from politicians to explore alternative options.
Second-quarter revenues at MPS totalled 740.4 million euros, slightly ahead of expectations and better than the year-ago figure, with net fees up 18%, more than offseting the drop in net interest income.

In a sign of improving operating trends, net fees and income from the core lending business were up from the first quarter, while overall revenue declined quarter-on-quarter due to strong trading gains between January and March.

666,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 01:17PM ET</span>",Analysis-Private equity struggles to get in on $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure bonanza,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Private equity firms are fretting that a long-awaited $1 trillion infrastructure bill https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senators-gird-cbo-analysis-1-trillion-infrastructure-bill-2021-08-05 under negotiation by U.S. lawmakers will not create enough opportunities for them to invest in lucrative assets such as toll roads and airports. 
The draft bill would force cities and states seeking major federal funding to show they have considered using public-private partnerships (P3s) to procure projects. Yet it stops short of instructing local authorities to use P3s.
This is a blow to buyout firms such as Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Brookfield Asset Management, which have raised hundreds of billions of dollars to invest in infrastructure. They had lobbied through outfits such as the Global Infrastructure Investor Association for greater participation in bankrolling the projects.
Many U.S. cities and states have resisted the use of P3s because they do not want to share the revenue generated by projects with private investors, or give up control over how the projects are procured, like the number of jobs created and how much they will pay. This is despite many government-run projects suffering from delays and cost overruns. 
Several local authorities also enjoy access to the $4 trillion U.S. municipal bond market, which allows them to pay for these projects but has left them highly indebted. 
With states and municipalities accounting for 87% of U.S. government-owned infrastructure, some private equity fund managers said the bill can do little in its current form to advance the use of private capital in infrastructure. 
""If you want the private sector to participate, you need to really embrace public-private partnerships. But I did not see enthusiasm both on the part of President Joe Biden's administration or the Republicans to make it an essential element of the plan,"" said Sadek Wahba, managing partner at I Squared Capital, which has $30 billion in infrastructure assets under management. 
Blackstone and KKR declined to comment. Brookfield did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The United States lags other major economies in utilizing private investments in infrastructure. It announced less than half the number of so-called public-private partnerships that were launched in Europe between 2005 and 2014, according to data from the World Bank and the European Investment Bank.
The draft bill, which has yet to be approved by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, would require local authorities that are applying for federal funding to cover project costs of more than $750 million to conduct a ""value for money analysis"" on the use of P3s. There is no obligation on the local authorities to use P3s after they conduct the analysis.
""The federal government is largely providing funding, but state and local governments have to then come up with the projects,"" said Emmett McCann, a co-portfolio manager of about $4 billion of infrastructure assets for Oaktree Capital Management LP. 
Lawrence Slade, the chief executive officer of the Global Infrastructure Investors Association, said there was little a federal bill could do to compel local authorities given the decentralized procurement of U.S. infrastructure. But he added that it at least ""opened the door"" for states to use more private capital in the financing of infrastructure.
NO INFRASTRUCTURE BANK
Mistrust of private capital runs deep in some cities. Chicago, for example, canceled a deal to lease its Midway Airport in 2013 after bidders backed out over the city's insistence to add ""taxpayer protection"" in the contract, including a short lease term and revenue sharing.
An earlier version of the bill had provisions for a $20 billion infrastructure bank, which private equity fund managers said could have helped seed P3s. Disagreements over whether the bank's funding should be tied to setting minimum thresholds for workers sank the idea, Reuters reported last month.
North America-focused infrastructure funds, which are dominated by the U.S.-based managers, raised $53 billion last year, down from $55.5 billion in 2019, according to data provider Preqin. Opportunities for them to deploy that capital in the United States have been mainly in the private sector, with investments focused in the energy and telecommunications industries. 

Karl Kuchel, chief executive of Macquarie Infrastructure Partners, which has about $10 billion in U.S. infrastructure assets under management, said he hoped the bill's requirement of P3s would over time result in some local authorities seeing their merits. 
""It will take some time for this to work its way through into specific partnership opportunities,"" Kuchel said.

(Reuters) -Shares of  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) tumbled 13% after the health insurer warned of a bigger hit to its full-year earnings due to the impact of the pandemic and said it also expects non-COVID costs to trend near normal levels in the second half of the year.
The company said both COVID-19 and non-COVID costs were above expectations for the second quarter. 
COVID-19 costs were higher in April than in May and June, and for the balance of the year these costs are expected to run at a lower level than they did in the first half of the year, Chief Financial Officer Brian Evanko said. 
Health insurers have largely benefited from a decline in patient use of discretionary healthcare services due to the pandemic, but demand for these services is recovering as more Americans get vaccinated.
Meanwhile, rivals Anthem Inc and  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp recently warned of a potential rise in coronavirus-related costs in the second half of 2021 due to the impact of the fast-spreading Delta variant.
Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH), Anthem and Centene were down between 2% and 5%.
Cigna's medical care ratio (MCR), the amount spent on medical claims versus income from premiums, worsened to 85.4% in the second quarter, from 70.5% a year earlier, compared with an estimate of 81.04%, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv.
The company now expects 2021 MCR to be between 83.0% and 84.0%, up from its prior forecast of 81.0% to 82.0%.
A lower medical expense ratio is better for health insurers.

While the spike in Cigna's MCR is disappointing, the issue is mostly transitory and manageable, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper said in a client note. 
Cigna expects full-year earnings to take a hit of about $2.50 per share, compared with its previous forecast of about $1.25 per share.

668,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 01:01PM ET</span>",India to scrap retrospective tax law in olive branch to global firms,"By Aftab Ahmed and Manoj Kumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India on Thursday proposed scrapping a controversial law that taxed companies retrospectively and said it will refund disputed amounts, a move that could potentially settle its multi-billion-dollar tax cases with Cairn Energy (OTC:CRNCY) and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD).
The amendment to the tax law could resolve at least 17 disputes of tax payments amounting to 500 billion rupees ($6.7 billion) or more, and will help boost investor confidence in the South Asian economy, analysts said.
Taxes on the indirect transfer of Indian assets before May 2012 will be nullified if companies withdraw litigation and give an undertaking that they will no longer claim damages, a government proposal presented to parliament said.
""This is a bold move that addresses the concerns of many foreign investors,"" said Rohinton Sidhwa, Partner at Deloitte India.
At the heart of the long-running taxation disputes was a 2012 Indian law that enabled its tax authorities to make retroactive claims on overseas corporate deals. 
Tax demands under the law had stoked high-profile legal challenges from companies and soured the investment climate even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government came to power in 2014. But the prime minister faced criticism for not swiftly resolving the matter.
Cairn, which has oil and gas operations in India, was awarded damages of more than $1.2 billion https://www.reuters.com/article/cairn-energy-india-arbitration-idINKBN28X0G2 last year at a tribunal at The Hague after a lengthy tussle with New Delhi over certain tax claims. 
And The Hague tribunal last year ruled that India's imposition of a $2 billion tax on Vodafone related to its purchase of Indian mobile assets from Hutchison Whampoa in 2007 breached an investment treaty https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-vodafone-group-arbitration-idUSKCN26G1CR between India and the Netherlands.
Tarun Bajaj, revenue secretary at the finance ministry, told Reuters that the current government had proposed scrapping the law as it doesn't believe in retrospective taxation.
""Now it depends on companies to come forward,"" and settle, he said. 
Cairn in a statement said it was monitoring the Indian law changes and will provide ""a further update in due course."" Vodafone declined comment.
EYEING ECONOMIC BOOST
India's proposed changes come just weeks after a French tribunal ordered a freeze on some 20 properties of the Indian government as Cairn started enforcing its arbitration award. The government at the time said it ""will vigorously defend its case"".
India has also proposed to return the principal tax amount companies may have paid under the controversial 2012 law, but it will not refund any interest New Delhi may have owed to them if it lost the legal cases.
In Cairn's case, for example, that amount stands at roughly 80 billion rupees ($1.08 billion).
Some analysts, however, said the delayed course correction by the Indian government may not help all disputes as some companies would not like to lose the interest due to them. 

The move is seen as one which will attract foreign investors to India and in turn bolster economic recovery after Asia's third largest economy contracted 7.3% in the last fiscal year ending in March.
""The country today stands at a juncture when quick recovery of the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic is the need of the hour,"" finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told lawmakers.

(Reuters) - The Canadian regulator looking into telecom company Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Communications' planned C$20 billion ($16 billion) purchase of Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR), has obtained court orders to advance its review, the Competition Bureau said on Thursday.
In March, Rogers agreed to buy Shaw in a deal that would create Canada's second-largest cellular and cable operator.
The Canadian government was quick to say it would attract stiff regulatory scrutiny, including an investigation from the Competition Bureau and a parliamentary hearing.
The orders obtained earlier this week will allow the bureau to compel companies including BCE (NYSE:BCE) Inc, TELUS Corp and Quebecor Inc-owned Videotron to produce records relevant to the investigation, a statement from the bureau said.
It is not clear how long the investigation will take, the statement said.

Rogers and Shaw declined to comment on the move.
Rogers shares were flat while Shaw shares were up 0.8%, while the benchmark Canadian share index was up 0.4%.

Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock fell 1.4%, and Magna (NYSE:MGA) was 2% higher.
The maker of Snapdragon chips has offered $37 in cash for each share of Veoneer, 18% higher than Magna’s July 23 offer of $31.25.
Veoneer designs, develops and manufactures software, hardware and systems for occupant protection, advanced driving assistance systems, collaborative and automated driving.
Its sensors and software solutions are aimed at preventing traffic accidents and, when accidents are unavoidable, its restraint control systems help lessen the effects of a crash.
As cars get smart, demand for products made by companies like Veoneer is only expected to increase and hence the interest from Qualcomm and Magna.
Veoneer pegs its total addressable market at ~$18 billion by 2023 and ~$29 billion in 2026.
Due to dependence on premium brands, Veoneer is over-represented with OEMs which tend to have lower light vehicle volumes. Over the next five years Veoneer expects to increase its percentage of sales with the top 10 OEMs, based on light vehicle production.

672,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 12:31PM ET</span>",Moderna says its COVID-19 shot maintains high efficacy through 6 months,"By Michael Erman
(Reuters) -  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc said on Thursday its COVID-19 vaccine was about 93% effective through six months after the second dose, showing hardly any change from the 94% efficacy reported in its original clinical trial.
However, the company said it still expects booster shots to be necessary ahead of the winter season as antibody levels are expected to wane.
It and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), which make a similar messenger RNA-based vaccine, have been advocating for a third shot to maintain a high level of protection against COVID-19, especially as more contagious variants of the virus spread widely. 
Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said during a conference call that the company would not be able to produce more than the 800 million to 1 billion doses of the vaccine it has already targeted for this year.
""We are not taking any more orders for 2021 because we are we are totally maxed out,"" he said.
Moderna shares were down slightly at $413.62 after hitting a record high earlier in the day. 
The new Moderna data comes from the company's roughly 30,000-participant clinical trial used to support the vaccine's emergency authorization in December.
It compares favorably to data from Pfizer and BioNTech last week that showed their vaccine's efficacy waned about 6% every two months, declining to around 84% six months after the second shot. 
While the shots are similar, they are not identical. Moderna's doses contain 100 micrograms of vaccine, while Pfizer's contain 30 micrograms.
""Our COVID-19 vaccine is showing durable efficacy of 93% through six months, but recognize that the Delta variant is a significant new threat so we must remain vigilant,"" Bancel said.
The six-month data also suggests that Moderna's vaccine still provides 98% protection against severe disease and was 100% effective at preventing death caused by COVID-19. There were three deaths in the placebo arm of the trial.
Public health officials around the world are debating whether additional vaccine booster doses will be necessary as they grapple with the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus that has become dominant in many countries, leading to a surge in cases and hospitalizations, especially among the unvaccinated.
Pfizer has said it is planning to seek authorization for a third shot later this month. Some countries like Israel and Germany have begun or plan to start administering booster shots to older or vulnerable people.
BOOSTER CANDIDATES 
Moderna said its studies of three different booster candidates induced robust antibody responses against variants, including Gamma, Beta and Delta. 
It said neutralizing antibody levels following the boost approached those observed after the second shot.
For this year, Moderna has signed vaccine contracts worth $20 billion in sales. It has agreements for $12 billion in 2022, with options for another roughly $8 billion in sales, and expects to produce between 2 billion and 3 billion doses next year.
The company has not been able to keep pace with much larger Pfizer, which expects to manufacture as many as 3 billion doses this year and 2021 sales https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-raises-estimates-2021-sales-covid-19-vaccine-335-bln-2021-07-28 to top $33.5 billion. Moderna's vaccine was authorized for emergency use in adults in the United States in December and has since been cleared for emergency or conditional use in adults in more than 50 countries.
The company expects to finish its submission for full approval with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this month.
Moderna reported second-quarter sales of $4.4 billion, slightly above analysts' expectations of $4.2 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Its COVID-19 shot is the company's first commercial product. Sales were just $67 million a year earlier. 

Moderna earned $2.78 billion, or $6.46 a share, in the second quarter, beating Wall Street expectations of $5.96 a share.
Moderna's shares touched a record high of $443.99 earlier on Thursday, bringing its market value to around $180 billion. That is roughly the same as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), which has 76,100 employees and revenue of $26.6 billion last year. Moderna employs about 1,800 people.

675,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 12:16PM ET</span>","Uber, Lyft take different spending routes in race to add drivers","By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - A return to business as usual for Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and its rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) has thrown up a new challenge to the ride-hailing firms looking for profitability - spend more to bring back drivers to meet the rising demand for rides.
Between the two, their spending plans have differed. 
Uber shelled out $250 million in the second quarter and has now begun cutting back as it added more hands behind the wheels, while Lyft has decided to keep spending into the third quarter.
With trip demand so far outpacing driver supply, the ride-hail businesses risk alienating returning customers with higher prices and longer wait times if drivers fail to show up in big numbers.
Labor shortages have widely hampered an economic recovery in the United States, with the service industry struggling the most to find staff as enhanced U.S. jobless benefits, which are set to phase out in September, keep away workers for now.
""Despite the smaller pool of drivers available today, the benefits cliff in September is something Uber and the industry will benefit from,"" Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research said.
Returning drivers to their platforms is crucial for both Uber and Lyft to grow even as they cut costs amid pressure from investors for profitability.
To focus on its core ride-hailing, food-delivery and freight services, Uber has sold capital-intensive businesses like self-driving and flying taxi units, while Lyft, a streamlined business compared to Uber, has also been keeping a tight lid on costs.
In their latest earnings calls, top executives of both companies faced questions from analysts, who have been keeping a close eye on their spending plans, on how Uber and Lyft plan to improve driver supply.
Uber finance head Nelson Chai said it was reducing direct driver incentives and was allowing drivers to keep a higher share of the fare, while keeping the amount it takes from each ride low.

""Unlike at Lyft, where margins improved sequentially, it seems Uber made less use of surge pricing to fund these driver incentives, resulting in the hit to profitability,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said.
Both companies have said riders in July were returning in greater numbers than at anytime before the pandemic started.

Danish company Novo Nordisk surged 5.2% after it raised its full-year outlook and posted above-forecast quarterly earnings, while German industrial firm Siemens climbed 2.6% as it lifted its profit forecast. 
Mining stocks were the worst performers for the day, sinking 2.6% as iron ore and base metal prices dropped on fears of slowing Chinese demand. [IRONORE/] [MET/L]
The retail sector fell 0.5%, with Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) down 6.0% after Chinese sales were hit by a boycott of western brands, and rising COVID cases spurred the closure of factories in major supplier Vietnam.
Online fashion company Zalando fell 4.8% after it said it had spent more on marketing to keep its customers shopping.
Still, Adidas, along with German industry bellwethers Siemens, Nivea-maker Beiersdorf, as well as pharma firms Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and Merck upgraded their forecasts for the current year, citing increasing consumer spending and economic activity.
European stocks have surged 1.8% so far this week as a strong batch of earnings helped dispel concerns over rising cases of the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. 
A steady vaccination program is expected to bring about relative normalcy later this year and drive a rebound in economic growth. 
""Equity markets seem to be a little bit vulnerable right now. There is the Delta variant, fears of tightening as well as peaking earnings growth. We cannot rule out a correction,"" said Frederique Carrier, head of investment strategy, RBC Wealth Management.
""But so long as there is no recession in sight, markets stand to recover. We continue to be constructive on equities.""
Stronger-than-expected quarterly reports have led analysts to lift their projection to a near 140% jump in second-quarter profit for companies listed on the STOXX 600, as per Refinitiv IBES data.
UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 slipped 0.1%, while midcap stocks rose 0.7% after the Bank of England outlined plans to wean the British economy off COVID-related stimulus measures.

French diagnostics firm Eurofins Scientific jumped 10.3% to the top of the STOXX 600, after it announced a record first-half performance and upgraded its annual outlook.
Technology stocks continued their rally, ending 0.9% higher at a more than 20-year high.

(Reuters) - Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc said on Thursday it would generate higher revenue and use less cash in 2021, helped by a rebound in business jet flights and demand for aircraft after the pandemic sapped orders last year, driving up its shares as much as 8%.
Supply chain challenges that have hit aerospace globally would not prevent Bombardier from meeting its 2021 target of 120 business jet deliveries, Chief Executive Éric Martel told reporters. 
Bombardier is close to being sold out of all aircraft in 2021, with Martel telling analysts earlier he expects orders to pick up for the company's flagship Global 7500 jet ""between now and year-end.""
According to FlightAware data, business jet flights rose 23% in the week beginning July 21 over 2019 levels in the United States, the world's largest market for corporate aviation. 
Separately, Bombardier also disclosed that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police would join a global investigation into suspected bribery related to decade-old sales of company jets to Garuda Indonesia.
Bombardier shares were last up 5% at C$1.58. 
Rivals Textron (NYSE:TXT) and General Dynamics Corp's (N:GD) Gulfstream Aerospace are raising production to meet higher demand. 
Asked whether Bombardier was also considering higher production rates, Martel said the company is instead focused on increasing its $10.7 billion order backlog. 
Free cash flow usage for 2021, a metric closely watched by investors, is now expected to be better than $300 million, compared with previous guidance of $500 million. 
Full-year revenue is expected to exceed $5.8 billion, up from more than $5.6 billion.
Business jet revenue for the three months ended June 30 jumped 50% to $1.5 billion, compared with the $1.3 billion that analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv.
But Bombardier posted an adjusted net loss of $137 million, or 6 cents per share, for the second quarter.

Bombardier, the latest aerospace group to face scrutiny over past deals, has previously said the U.S. Department of Justice and Britain's Serious Fraud Office are investigating the acquisition and lease of its CRJ1000 aircraft to Garuda between 2011 and 2012.
“We are participating in the investigation, we support the investigation,"" Martel told reporters.

Weber's shares opened at $17, compared with their initial public offering (IPO) price of $14 per share.
The company downsized its IPO to about 17.9 million shares earlier in the day, less than half of what it was planning to sell earlier.
At a price of $14 per share, Weber raised about $250 million in its IPO. 
The Palatine, Illinois-based company, whose grill types include gas, electric and charcoal, made its debut a week after rival wood pellet grill maker Traeger Inc started trading on the NYSE. 
Weber was founded by George Stephen Sr., who invented the Weber Kettle - a dome-shaped charcoal grill - about 70 years ago. 
In the United States, Weber boasts of a 23% market share, according to Frost and Sullivan estimates cited in its regulatory filing. Globally, it holds 24% of the market. 
The company's revenue jumped 62% year-on-year in the six months ended March 31, driven by the increasing adoption of an outdoor lifestyle, Weber disclosed in the filing.
BDT Capital Partners, a U.S. fund run by Warren Buffett's banker Byron Trott, holds a controlling interest in the company in partnership with the Stephen family and management.

Entities including BDT will hold about 74% of the combined voting power of Weber's common stock after the offering.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), BofA Securities and J.P. Morgan were among the underwriters for the offering.

(Reuters) -Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc on Thursday blew past analysts' estimates for second-quarter profit and revenue and said it has seen a recent uptick in the use of its COVID-19 therapy by patients in the United States.
The therapy, REGEN-COV, and a similar treatment by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) have been authorized in the United States for treating non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the companies signed supply deals with the U.S. government worth millions of dollars.
""There's been a tremendous acceleration in use... (our penetration) in estimated eligible patients has gone up dramatically from somewhere in the low single digits to almost 25% to 30% more recently,"" said Leonard Schleifer, chief executive officer of Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), adding that more than 50,000 doses of REGEN-COV are being ordered weekly.
The company said it expects its COVID-19 therapy to continue to be a meaningful revenue contributor this year outside the U.S., as new cases rise globally.
U.S. sales of REGEN-COV surged to $2.59 billion in the second quarter, well ahead of Wall Street estimates of $1.5 billion, according to brokerage Guggenheim, as the company supplied 1.25 million doses in the quarter, completing its contract with the U.S. government.
This is in contrast to Eli Lilly, which was hit by weaker demand for its COVID-19 antibody therapy due to mass vaccine rollouts.
""I think it seems (Regeneron) is implying that they are seeing a substantial increase in the utilization of the therapy as the Delta variant is causing more infections throughout the country,"" said Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja.
However, the company's non-COVID-19 drugs are likely to be its main growth drivers going forward, Suneja added.
Sales of the company's eye disease drug Eylea jumped 32.7% to $2.33 billion in the quarter, bouncing back from pandemic-induced lows. Sales of its eczema drug, Dupixent, which are recorded by  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) also rose 58.6%. 
Excluding items, the company earned $25.8 per share, above estimates of $17.53, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Overall revenue of $5.14 billion also topped estimates of $3.92 billion.
Shares of the drugmaker were up 1.4% in morning trade.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Thomson Reuters Corp's second quarter results beat analysts' estimates on Thursday, with higher sales across its main divisions, as it raised its annual revenue forecast.
Underscoring its outlook, which was fueled by a recovering global economy, the global news and information company said on Thursday it would buy back up to $1.2 billion of its shares.
 Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) said it is monitoring whether the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 is affecting its businesses, but did not expect a major impact in 2021.
""We do not think that there is a significant financial impact for our customers, and therefore for us through the rest of this year,"" Chief Executive Steve Hasker said, adding that the course of the pandemic was unpredictable.
The Thomson Reuters print and events businesses are among the areas most vulnerable in case of a worsening of the COVID-19 situation, Chief Financial Officer Michael Eastwood added. 
Thomson Reuters, the parent company of Reuters News, said its total revenues rose 9% to $1.53 billion, compared to expectations of $1.5 billion. 
Adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents also topped analyst expectations, based on data from Refinitiv, marking the fifth consecutive quarter that Thomson Reuters' adjusted earnings topped Wall Street estimates.
Although operating profit was down 14% to $316 million, this reflected one-time gains in the year-ago quarter. 
The New York and Toronto-listed shares of Thomson Reuters were each up more than 3.5% after the results were published. The stock is up by more than a third this year.
The three main business divisions -- Legal Professionals, Tax & Accounting Professionals, and Corporates -- all reported higher sales, with the tax group achieving a 15% revenue gain, excluding currency fluctuations. 
On that basis, the Reuters News segment saw sales up 6% to $168 million in the quarter, aided by its events business.
All the divisions are expected to show higher sales in the third quarter, and total revenue for 2021 is now seen rising 4% to 4.5%, Thomson Reuters said, marking the second increase to sales guidance this year.
""The core business that generates the lion's share of revenue and even more of the profits is pretty predictable even in difficult operating environments for most companies, and that's why investors gravitate towards this stock,"" said Matt Arnold, analyst at Edward Jones, referring to the legal, corporate and tax and accounting segments.
Thomson Reuters executives said the company would spend between $300 million and $350 million this year as part of an estimated $600 million planned reinvestment in the business. 

The executives also said $700 million remained of a $2-billion mergers and acquisitions budget and it has a ""robust"" pipeline of targets in areas such as automation and small-to-medium cloud-based and software-as-services businesses.
The  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) in January closed a $27-billion deal data and analytics company Refinitiv that was part of Thomson Reuters until 2018. Thomson Reuters holds a minority stake in LSE worth $7.5 billion as of Aug. 4.

So read on for a closer evaluation of these names.Because many industries have resumed operating at close to full capacity on the recovery of economies, the transportation services market is experiencing a substantial upsurge in demand for cross-border services. In addition, because consumers continue to rely heavily on online shopping, freight demand has risen dramatically in recent months, surpassing the trucking industry's capacity to recruit new drivers and buy new equipment.

Shares of the company were up 5% on Thursday.
Paramount+, along with other streaming services like PlutoTV and Showtime OTT, added 6.5 million new subscribers in the quarter with viewers flocking to these platforms to catch titles like ""Infinite"", the new ""iCarly"" series, ""NCIS"" and the UEFA Champions League. 
With people now stepping out seeking in-person entertainment and increased pressure on traditional pay-TV services, media companies across the industry are looking to bolster their streaming services to take on giants like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+. Bundling services together through commercial partnerships is one option.
As the domestic market saturates, industry leaders are also looking outside the United States for growth. ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) is looking to expand Paramount+ into 45 markets by the end of 2022, including its launch in Europe through Sky. 
ViacomCBS' streaming advertising revenue doubled during the quarter as live sporting events returned and businesses spent more on ads, with the company posting a 92% jump in overall streaming revenue.

Fund managers are already putting that to the test.
Within the past 24 hours both ProShares and Invesco have registered plans with the SEC for funds based on futures.
The filings for the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF and Invesco Bitcoin Strategy ETF could well be the first of many. As regulators drag their feet on allowing a U.S. cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund, applications have been piling up. ProShares and Invesco are among more than a dozen issuers who have filed for ETFs investing in digital assets directly.
“With Gensler indicating the SEC is more likely to approve a futures-based Bitcoin ETF over a physical one, the race is on to offer such products,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. “There is pent-up demand for a U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF. We expect to see more filings in the coming days.”
In remarks to the Aspen Security Forum on Tuesday, Gensler said that an ETF that complies with the SEC’s strict rules for mutual funds could provide investors with necessary protections.
“I look forward to the staff’s review of such filings, particularly if those are limited to these CME-traded Bitcoin futures,” he said.
Following Gensler’s announcement earlier this week, many crypto backers voiced distress over the chairman’s preferred structure. An ETF focused on Bitcoin futures would require that investors put down a substantial amount of money on margin to trade, among other issues. Many have been hoping for a physically-backed Bitcoin instead.
“All this does is add unnecessary layers of middlemen and derivatives. It’s not what the people want,” Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst, said by phone. “Investors would be better served by a physically-backed ETF and I really think they understand the risks. At this point, even my mom knows what Bitcoin is about and that it’s not the same as a Treasury.”
Still, the futures-based funds would attract assets because they’ll be the best-possible offering right now, Balchunas said. He anticipates 10 to 15 new filings in the coming weeks, crowding out the field.
“It’s basically like the Kentucky Derby,” he said. “It’s like all these horses are now going over to this other track and rushing to the starting gate in hopes of getting approved.”

691,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 10:48AM ET</span>","Cost cuts, asset sales keep Rolls-Royce on track despite weak travel","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) -Rolls-Royce is on track to meet its forecasts for this year as cost cuts and asset sales help the British engine-maker weather a slow recovery in long-haul travel, it said on Thursday.
At the height of the pandemic last year, revenues at Rolls's civil aviation unit, its biggest business, tumbled as airlines stopped flying, resulting in a perilous few months before the company raised more cash and secured loans.
Raising 2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) from asset sales is key to repairing its finances, and Rolls said on Wednesday it was in exclusive talks with a buyer for its ITP Aero unit, for a reported 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion).
Rolls is also counting on a cost-cutting programme in its civil aviation business to help it while international flying continues at low levels due to the pandemic, and said it was on track to make more than 1 billion pounds of savings this year.
For January-June, Rolls posted an underlying operating profit of 307 million pounds, up sharply from the 1.63 billion loss it made last year, and shares in the group traded 2.2% higher to 107 pence in early deals. 
Chief Executive Warren East shrugged off worries about the slower than expected recovery in international travel, which the company said would mean it reaches a 2022 free cash flow target of 750 million pounds later than expected. 
""We're focused on what we can control,"" he told reporters. 
""We've plenty of liquidity to manage the uncertain pace of recovery in international travel."" 
For 2021, Rolls stuck to guidance for free cash outflow to improve to 2 billion pounds, and for cash flow to turn positive in the second half of this year, despite the slower pick-up in flying hours.
Rolls, whose engines power planes like Airbus A350s and Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s, said large engine flying hours came in at 43% of pre-pandemic levels in the first half. It has been hoping they will be at 55% for 2021 overall. 
During the first half, the group was buoyed by its defence arm, which makes engines for military jets and powers Britain's nuclear submarines, plus a recovery in its power systems unit, which makes engines for boats, trains and other vehicles.

692,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>","Fastly Tanks As It Misses Estimates On June Outage, Sees More Impact","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Fastly stock (NYSE:FSLY) plunged 23% Thursday as the June worldwide outage of the websites it supports sank its second-quarter revenue, forcing it to miss expectations.
The company’s guidance of continuing impact from the outage and its decision to cut the forecast to even below the original estimate after having raised it in May didn't help.
Fastly now expects 2021 revenue between $340 million and $350 million compared to the original forecast of $375 million to $385 million. The revised forecast had pegged the revenue in the range of $380 million to $390 million.  
The San Francisco-headquartered company runs a content-delivery network to push data quickly around the internet. It hosts a service that large enterprises use to serve content to millions of users simultaneously.
Rather than hosting all website content on a single set of servers in one location, Fastly puts cloud infrastructure in dozens of locations to let people download from a server closest to them.
‘Error 503’ showed up on June 8 on home pages of several websites like  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT), Reddit and that of the U.K. government. Major websites like Twitch, The Verge, and Benzinga were also affected. All the affected websites used Fastly. It took the company almost an hour to identify the cause -- a software bug.
Given the usage-based nature of Fastly’s business model, this resulted in an impact on its second-quarter results. The traffic on some of those websites remains affected. Not only this, several customers have also delayed the deployment of new traffic onto the Fastly platform.  
Chief Executive Officer Joshua Bixby warned of a downstream hit to revenue from the outage in the near-to medium-term “as we work with our customers to bring back their traffic to normal levels”.
Notwithstanding its issues, Fastly’s customer count grew to 2,581 in the June quarter from 2,458 in January-March.
Total revenue rose 14% year-over-year to $85 million, when $85.73 million was expected. The net loss was $58 million."

PARIS (Reuters) - Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) on Thursday reported a doubling in second-quarter profit, as an improving economy prompted it to set aside less money for bad loans, but the French bank's shares fell as its performance lagged rivals in corporate and investment banking. 
Unprecedented government support across Europe has helped borrowers keep up repayments despite the problems caused by the health crisis, allowing banks to shield profits and lower bad debt provisions.
Credit Agricole, France's second-largest listed bank, said its net income rose to 1.97 billion euros ($2.33 billion) in the second quarter from 954 million euros a year earlier.
Its cost of risk - a reflection of provisions against loan loss - was down by 66.8%, while revenue rose 18.8%.
However, the corporate and investment banking (CIB) business was a sore spot as revenue fell 13.7% in the quarter, led by a 28.3% drop in fixed income, currency and commodities trading on lower volatility in the market.
That compares with a 24.5% rise in CIB revenue at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and a 9.9% drop at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). 
""CIB is weaker than peers. It's not as good,"" a Paris-based trader said.
Shares in Credit Agricole pared losses to trade about 0.40% lower at 1400 GMT. 
Asked about the outlook on provisions, Credit Agricole Chief Executive Philippe Brassac told reporters he was confident for the second half, but declined to provide an estimate.
""The state takes action. It does it efficiently. This gives a safer risk paradigm for banks,"" Brassac said.
In the second quarter, the euro zone economy grew faster than expected, emerging from a pandemic-induced recession, while the easing of coronavirus restrictions drove inflation past the European Central Bank (ECB)'s 2% target in July.
Compared with the same period a year earlier, when lockdowns brought economic activity close to a standstill, GDP jumped 13.7%. In France, an initial forecast by the national statistics office last week showed the economy grew 0.9% in the quarter. 
Credit Agricole's CFO Jerome Grivet told analysts the bank was on track to reach its 2022 targets, including a 5 billion euros net profit.
Credit Agricole said it booked a 258 million euros exceptional gain in the second quarter on badwill following the acquisition of Italian lender Creval earlier this year. 
The bank also said it had applied to the ECB for a second share buyback of up to 500 million euros in the fourth quarter.

Last month, the European central bank said it would lift restrictions on dividend and share buybacks beyond September, withdrawing a crisis measure that forced banks to retain capital during the pandemic.

Hence, Wall Street analysts expect auto retailers KAR Auction Services (KAR) and Cars.com (CARS) to rally by more than 35% in the near term.

With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases due to the rapid spread of its Delta variant, people are expected to continue using private cars rather than public transport, driving up the demand for used cars. Furthermore, with an increase in car-related services on digital platforms, the automotive retail industry could continue to gain significantly in the coming months.

(Reuters) - Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) said on Wednesday it had administered more than 29 million COVID-19 vaccines at its stores so far, led by a surge in parts of the United States that had lagged in vaccinations.
Vaccine administration surged more than 30% in states such as Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Kentucky in the past few weeks, the drugstore chain said.
The company, among the largest U.S. pharmacy chains, had said in June that it expects to administer 28 million vaccines in fiscal year 2021.
Walgreens also said it had made masks mandatory for its U.S. employees and required staff working at U.S. support offices to be fully vaccinated, the latest company to update its policies as COVID-19 cases rise in the United States.
New guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that recommends fully vaccinated individuals wear mask as well as surging cases due to the more infectious Delta variant have led companies to rethink their policies.
Walgreens said on Wednesday it also encouraged all customers, including those who are vaccinated, to wear masks.

It said the vaccination mandate, which requires employees , to be inoculated by Sept. 30, does not apply to U.S. employees working in stores, distribution centers or other facilities.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Detroit's Big Three automakers also updated their vaccination and masking policies on Tuesday.

The state-owned Gulf airline said on Thursday it had been told to ground the planes until ""the root cause can be established and a satisfactory solution made available to permanently correct the underlying condition.""
Qatar Airways has been locked in a months-long public dispute with Airbus, insisting it would not take any deliveries of the carbon-composite widebody jet until the problem was resolved.
""With this latest development, we sincerely expect that Airbus treats this matter with the proper attention that it requires,"" Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said in a statement announcing the regulator's grounding of the jets.
""Qatar Airways expects Airbus to have established the root cause and permanently corrected the underlying condition to the satisfaction of Qatar Airways and our regulator before we take delivery of any further A350 aircraft.” 
An Airbus spokesperson told Reuters the planemaker was always in talks with its customers but those discussions were confidential, declining to comment further.
Qatar Airways said in June it had grounded some of its A350 jets until the issue could be understood and fixed, without disclosing how many aircraft had been pulled from service.
It said on Thursday it had brought A330 aircraft back into to service to make up for the lost capacity and was also ""looking at other solutions.""
Qatar Airways is the largest customer for the A350 and has taken delivery of 53 out of 76 on order.
The airline has periodically criticised Airbus or its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) for delays or quality lapses.

It says its exacting standards reflect its premium brand, although aerospace executives have accused it of seizing on such details in the past to delay taking deliveries or gain leverage in other negotiations, a suggestion it has denied.
Many airlines have adjusted deliveries due to the pandemic-related travel downturn. Qatar Airways said in June 2020 it would not take Boeing or Airbus jets in 2020 or 2021 and later that year said it had reached a deal on schedules with Airbus.

Cash-rich Canadian oil sands producers have come under pressure to meet the country's goal on energy transition and top companies, including Canadian Natural, said in June they would form an alliance to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from their operations by 2050. 
Canadian Natural said it is now targeting 50% reduction in methane emissions from its North America exploration and production business by 2030, from baseline of 2016. 
It also added that it plans to cut fresh water used to generate steam and mining fresh river water by 40% by 2026, from baseline of 2017.
The company also said it would look to set aside 50% of free cash flow for share repurchases, once it reaches $15 billion in debt, expected in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted earnings of C$1.24 per share in the quarter ended June 30, beat analysts' estimate of 92 Canadian cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Oil and gas producers have bounced back this year as COVID-19 vaccinations allowed some countries to ease pandemic-related curbs, supporting higher crude prices. 
Average realized prices for crude rose 16.2% to C$61.2 per barrel in the second quarter, from the first. 
The company, which operates in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and Saskatchewan, produced 1.14 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the reported quarter, compared to 1.25 million boepd in first quarter. 

Canadian Natural said if pipeline operator Inter Pipeline (OTC:IPPLF)'s takeover by Brookfield succeeds, the company would use the proceeds and boost its 2021 capital budget by $275 million to $3.48 billion. Canadian Natural owns about 6.4 million shares of Inter.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 09:06AM ET</span>",Drinks makers target high-end spirits for post-COVID growth,"(Corrects name of group in paragraph 6 to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis)
By Siddharth Cavale and Francesca Landini
BENGALURU/MILAN (Reuters) -Major drinks companies are making deals and reaching joint ventures to boost their offerings of spirits priced at $200-a-bottle and up, the fastest-growing segment in the $1 trillion global market for alcoholic drinks. 
Louis Vuitton's wines and spirits division Moët Hennessy and rival Campari last month announced an alliance to sell premium beverages online as they jostle for a piece of the $50 billion global high-end spirits market. 
 Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), which makes Martell cognac, over the past two years has invested in a number of ""super‐premium"" and ""ultra‐premium brands,"" including a ""significant investment"" in Japan's Kyoto Distillery, the producer of ultra‐premium gin Ki No Bi. That was followed by the buyout of ultra‐premium German brand Monkey 47 gin early last year.
Drinks companies are seeking M&A opportunities because sales of higher-priced drinks are expected to grow more than moderately priced beverages in the next five years. 
""Luxury is and will remain a key driver of our strategy,"" Pernod Ricard's Portfolio Strategy Director Yves Schladenhaufen said in July. 
Sales of 750 ml bottles of premium drinks priced at $200 and up are expected to grow 9.3% annually until 2025, outpacing lower-priced drinks,  according to  the IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.  In contrast, sales of $10-per-bottle products - so-called value brands - are forecast to  grow just  0.8% annually  over the same period. 
""Lockdowns created a renewed interest in cocktails as people experimented with their mixology skills at home,"" said Tony Latham, CFO for Bacardi Limited. 
""We believe this will translate into people being more adventurous and seeking out premium, quality drinks when they return to the bar.""
Bowmore whiskey maker Beam Suntory, which is privately owned, has committed to achieving more than half its revenue from premium drinks by 2030. 
Siddharth Banerji, the head of Kyndal Group, a distributor of Macallan Scotch whisky and other high-end spirits brands in India, said the pandemic reminded some consumers that life is short, leading to a live-for-the-moment attitude. 
""There is a philosophical attitude towards alcohol, whereby people are thinking they could die any time and have the realization that money is not going to save your life,"" he said.
Andy  Sung, a  Houston-based  whisky collector who  reviews rare and limited-edition whiskies on Instagram  for his 10,000 followers,  said he sees more people showing interest in investing and collecting high-end whisky than he did a few years ago. Prices  for rare, small-batch and limited-edition whiskies during the past year  reached  ""absolutely insane"" levels, he said. 
For example, when the GlenAllachie Distillers Company released just 2,000 bottles of its 30-year old GlenAllachie whisky in May, the scotch that retails for 475 pounds ($662) a bottle sold out instantly and is now going for double that price at auctions, Sung said.
Historically, consumer preference tends to swing from favouring brown spirits, such as whisky and bourbon, to white spirits, such as vodka and gin, every 15 or so years, as young adults tend to reject the brands and categories favored by their parents. 
Because brown spirits have been in favour for the past 14 years, some companies now are betting on high-end white spirits - such as tequila and mezcal, a smokier version of tequila - said Ken Harris of Cadent Consulting Group, who represents several spirits companies on deals. 
Harris said companies on the hunt for high-end products to add to their portfolios are willing to pay premiums of as much as five times a brand's value.
LUXURY SPIRITS
In June, Campari also launched a dedicated division focused on luxury spirits in the United States, with its Chief Executive Bob Kunze-Concewitz telling Reuters this strategy would likely give the group the opportunity to buy new ""niche and precious brands.""
The Italian drinks group, whose premium portfolio includes aged Glen Grant whisky and special editions of Grand Marnier liqueur, is now looking at tequila.
""We continue to look at the super-premium-and-up part of tequila as an area of opportunity ... for M&A,"" Kunze-Concewitz said on a post-earnings call in July. 
Bacardi Limited said 2021 would be the ""year  of innovation"" with  plans  to launch  many ""new expressions,""  and limited-editions for some of its bestselling brands including Grey Goose vodka and Bombay Sapphire gin.
In Europe, the pandemic has accelerated consumers' interest in purchasing high-end spirits online, said Alberto Gennarini, a partner with Vitale & Co consultancy, who advised Campari on past deals. 
Campari and Moët Hennessy, which entered a joint venture in July, may seek to expand e-commerce platforms Tannico and Ventealapropriete.com beyond France and Italy, according to industry sources.
The return of customers to luxury restaurants and five-star hotels due to vaccination-induced confidence is expected to also boost demand of higher-end drinks. In the United States, nearly 85% of bars and restaurants are open despite a spike in coronavirus cases, a sign that vaccinated people are showing more confidence in dining outside.  
Despite rising Delta variant cases, the appetite for dealmaking has not slowed and valuations of premium spirits brands have not fallen, Harris said. 
""The Delta variant has not affected anything. It shows that there is a resiliency and a longer-term view on where this category is going,"" he said.
Harris also noted that while there are limited independent spirits companies making ultra-premium liquors, their valuations have increased even more as they discovered e-commerce as an avenue to sell their products, instead of banking on big companies for expanding their distribution earlier.
 Diageo  (LON:DGE)'s Chief Executive Ivan Menezes said last week that the company is picky when it comes to deals but it also hasn't been easy to find acquisition targets as there are limited purveyors of ultra-premium spirits. 
For such brands, acquisition price would not necessarily inhibit a deal as long as the brand fits within Diageo's ""disciplined"" growth ambitions, he added, which is to grow the super-premium end of its portfolio in fast growing categories, including US whiskey, tequila, and gin. 

Spirits sales, as measured in dollars, in the United States rose 1.3% in 2020  despite pandemic-induced lockdowns,  according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group. Spirits priced within the $115-$170 range grew by 7.3%,  while those priced at $179-and-above grew by 12.7%, and sales of $10-and-below bottles declined, it said.

Investing.com – Uber stock (NYSE:UBER) was down 4.5% in Thursday’s premarket trading as higher incentives to attract and retain drivers took the ride-haling and food delivery app deeper into the red in the June quarter.
In a call with analysts, Uber’s Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai said consumer demand returned faster than drivers as markets opened up in the second quarter.
Uber spent a massive $250 million in driver incentive investment in the second quarter.
Notwithstanding the hurt to margins due to higher incentives, Chai said the company will be able to achieve quarterly adjusted EBITDA profitability this year.
According to the CFO, more drivers are returning and food delivery orders are seen staying strong.
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi downplayed the threat of the delta variant currently raging through the U.S. and parts of Europe, Australia and several other countries.
Notwithstanding the virus, gross bookings increased June-July, with customers in New York City, London and Paris spending 30% more last month than they did in July 2019.
Gross bookings grew 114% year-over-year to $21.9 billion. Mobility gross bookings rose 184% and delivery gross bookings 85%.
Revenue more than doubled, rising 105% year-on-year to $1.91 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA was a negative $509 million, higher than the $359 million negative EBITDA it had posted in the March quarter. On a year-on-year basis though, adjusted EBITDA improved by $328 from a negative $837 million.
Net income was $1.1 billion and was driven by unrealized gains due to the revaluation of Uber’s equity investments in Didi and Aurora.
For the current quarter, Uber expects adjusted EBITDA loss in Q3 to improve to less than $100 million in addition to record gross bookings between $22 billion and $24 billion.

The planned payouts are more modest than the bonus bonanza on Wall Street, but European banks nonetheless risk a public backlash at a time when many businesses and individuals are still struggling in the pandemic, advocacy groups for fair pay said.
Britain-based  Barclays  (LON:BARC) increased its bonus pool by 46% to 1.1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion), up from 749 million pounds a year earlier, while HSBC topped up its bonus pool by $900 million in the first half.
Standard Chartered said a ""normalisation of performance-related pay"" during the first half drove an 8% jump in costs, to $5.1 billion.
Senior bank executives and recruiters said the market is the most competitive they have seen in a decade, as rebounding economies worldwide, pent-up demand and the fad for investing via Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) drives dealmaking activity.
Swiss bank UBS boosted pay for its financial advisers by $242 million in the second quarter after booking higher revenues, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) upped pay and benefits in its investment bank by 6% compared with the same period a year ago.
Bonuses and pay increases are likely to continue to build in the second half of the year, said Sophie Scholes, head of the UK financial services practice at headhunters Heidrick & Struggles (NASDAQ:HSII).
""Banks are anticipating that the next bonus round will be one where they need to pay out, driven by two factors,"" she said.
""One is the sheer competition for talent, and that means retaining good people, and two is that because of all the market activity people have a good pipeline and some good wins behind them, and banks are trying to prepare for that.""
The trend is global, Scholes said, with banks in Europe and Asia playing catch-up to the United States.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has increased its compensation by $3.5 billion on the prior year, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has added $2 billion.
Goldman has also raised base pay for juniors to $110,000 after rivals such as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan increased first-year pay. 
This is prompting European rivals to follow suit, with HSBC this week telling staff it would pay newly hired analysts in its U.S. investment bank $100,000 a year. 
""The U.S. is extraordinary in terms of activity, which comes from their economic recovery being seen as more robust, and it has always been a highly acquisitive market in terms of talent,"" Scholes said. 
'MORALLY DUBIOUS'
While big payouts are back, in Britain rules that cap payouts at twice the level of base pay and concerns about public perception of banker bonuses during a global crisis mean lenders are showing some restraint.
""Paying out huge bonuses at a time when businesses and households are struggling and the economic outlook remains so uncertain is not only morally dubious but financially irresponsible,"" said Simon Youel, head of policy and advocacy at Positive Money.
Youel said much of banks' recent profitability could be traced to state support measures for the economy. British newspaper reports have suggested UK banks are lobbying to remove the cap on bonuses of twice base pay, which Youel said the government should reject. 
The volatile nature of investment banks' revenues means they must lower variable pay to manage profitability in tough times, Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley said, and also pay up when business is booming.
""When we have in fact delivered very strong revenue growth, that's reflected in the compensation... we think we are being prudent in how we manage it,"" he told reporters last week on a conference call.
One bank board rejected an executive's rating of their team as too generous and told them to downgrade it for fear of otherwise having to pay out too much, Scholes said.
Even traditionally more conservative retail banks are increasing pay.
Lloyds (LON:LLOY), Britain's bellwether mortgage lender, said it would spend an extra 100 million pounds on bonuses this year, after axing them for all but its lowest paid staff last year.
Bank executives said they would have to keep paying up despite concerns about public perception.

""We have to reward people,"" the Chief Executive of a British bank said, without wanting to be identified. ""People have had a difficult time, and if you've stayed in a role and you've been locked away and had to go above and beyond, you expect to be rewarded.""

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Shares in Finnish stainless steel maker Outokumpu fell 5.6% to 5.46 euros on Thursday after the company beat expectations in second-quarter core earnings but warned deliveries were likely to fall by up to 10% in the third quarter.
Instead of demand decreasing in the second half due to the seasonal nature of Outokumpu's industry, Chief Executive Heikki Malinen sees demand for stainless steel and ferrochrome continuing to be strong and delivery volumes falling only due to planned maintenance.
""The 0 to 10% drop in volumes boils down to what our need for shutdowns will be,"" Malinen told Reuters and added that Outokumpu has already seen customers starting negotiations on deliveries for 2022.
Analyst Petri Gostowski from Inderes said the drop in share price could mean shareholders were reacting to the expected seasonal change in the business.
""Some investors are bringing home the wins and estimating the market drivers will not be as favourable in the second half,"" Gostowski said. 
Outokumpu posted an April-June operating profit of 163 million euros ($193 million) versus a loss of 16 million a year earlier and topped the 143.4 million expected by seven analysts, data from Refinitiv Eikon showed.
The good result was aided by higher stainless steel and ferrochrome prices, the company said.
Stainless steel deliveries rose to 626,000 tonnes from 523,000 tonnes a year earlier as demand recovered from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Sales rose 31.9% to 1.87 billion euros.
Malinen said Outokumpu was producing as much ferrochrome as possible in its three smelter furnaces in northern Finland but added that ""we are pretty much at capacity"". 
Ferrochrome production was stable from the first quarter at 131,000 tonnes but sold at higher prices and sales were up 28% at 155 million euros.
Outokumpu has been focusing on cutting costs and reducing risk since publishing a new strategy last November. 
The company said it would cut costs to increase earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation by 200 million euros by the end of 2022.

Malinen said Outokumpu had achieved 123 million euros of that target in the first half of 2021.

708,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",Glencore to return $2.8 billion to shareholders in 2021,"By Clara Denina and Zandi Shabalala
LONDON (Reuters) - Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) will return $2.8 billion to shareholders in 2021 after soaring commodity prices helped the mining and trading company to a record performance for the first six months of the year, it said on Thursday.
The London-listed company joins rivals Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) in declaring bonanza payouts after record half-year profits buoyed by a rebound in demand for commodities. [MET/L] 
""Following COVID-19's severe global impacts in early 2020, the subsequent economic recovery has seen prices of most of our commodities surging to multi-year highs,"" said Glencore CEO Gary Nagle, who took the helm of the company in July. 
Provided commodity prices hold up and net debt stays in check, Glencore could increase payouts further, chief financial officer Steven Kalmin said.
""We wouldn't leverage the business further to pay distributions but we are happy to move towards 100% payout ratio given where the balance sheet is,"" Kalmin told reporters on a call.
Glencore cut debt to $10.6 billion from $15.8 billion at the end of 2020. 
This was within its target range of $10-$16 billion, which the miner said it would need to reach before increasing dividends and in February, it recommended a total payout of $1.6 billion. It will now add a further $1.2 billion.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 79% to a record $8.7 billion in the six months to June, compared with $4.8 billion a year earlier, broadly in line with analysts' consensus.
The results surpass a previous high in 2018, when Glencore was again buoyed by a strong commodity rally. 
(GRAPHIC: Glencore H1 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lbpgnrdywvq/glencore%20H1.JPG) 
Glencore's trading or marketing division, which sets it apart from the other big diversified miners, cashed in on volatility in the market and recorded a EBIT of $1.8 billion in the period. The division is expected to hit the top end of its guidance of $2.2-$3.2 billion per annum.
TIGHT SUPPLY 
Prone to boom and bust, the mining sector is still recovering from a period of cost-cutting that halted exploration projects and acquisitions and has raised the risk of supply shortfalls as demand increases with economic recovery.
Nagle told analysts in a call the company favoured expanding existing projects over greenfield projects or acquisitions. 
Glencore shares shed 1.2% by 1105 GMT, but still outperformed most of its peers that tracked wider stocks lower. 
(GRAPHIC: Miners outpace FTSE - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/zjpqkqgdlpx/miners%20outpace.JPG) 
Analysts at Citi said the strong results ""set the stage"" for a bigger buyback at the year-end and that Glencore's commodity mix was weighted towards the metals, such as cobalt and copper, needed for the transition to electric vehicles and other low emission technology.
But investors focused on ESG (environmental, social and governance) factors have pressed for changes at mining companies. 
Glencore in June bought the stakes it didn't already own in its Colombia thermal coal mine from partners BHP plc and Anglo American, boosting its coal assets when others are looking to exit the sector. The deal should complete in the first half of 2022.
It has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 as its output of fossil fuels declines over time and it says it is taking steps to reduce emissions.
Glencore said legal costs, including its own investigations, rose to $216 million during the first half from $56 million in the same year-ago period, having ""provided for one specific narrow aspect of these investigations"". It did not provide further explanation.

The U.S. Department of Justice is scrutinising Glencore over alleged corruption in dealings in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela and Nigeria. 
Any settlement would remove an important risk factor from Glencore's stock, which is still well below its flotation price, analysts said.

China last month issued rules barring curriculum-based tutoring for profit, aiming to ease financial pressures that have contributed to low birth rates but have left private education firms facing significant business impact. 
ByteDance will lay off some teachers, sales and advertising staff in the education unit and will shut its curriculum-focused preschool and K12 (NYSE:LRN) tutoring businesses in China to be compliant with the regulations, according to one of the sources and a third source. 
The closures include the shuttering of its one-on-one English online classes app Gogokid, two of the sources said. On Thursday, the app was not available to be downloaded from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in China. 
ByteDance did not offer immediate comment. 
ByteDance, whose hit products include short video apps TikTok and Douyin as well as news aggregator Toutiao, had hoped to find one of its next successes in education, making it one of its top priorities over the past year. 
It established education unit Dali, which translates to ""forceful strength"" in Chinese, last October and runs several tutoring apps aimed at preschool kids and K12 students. The unit has more than 10,000 employees and its other products include school courses tutoring app Qingbei.

The scale of layoffs could not be immediately learnt and two sources said the company has been transferring some employees from its education business to other parts of the company. 
Other education companies such as U.S.-listed TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL), Gaotu Techedu, New Oriental Education & Technology Group have warned that they expect to face material adverse impacts on their after-school tutoring services.

710,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 07:27AM ET</span>","Lufthansa narrows loss on cost cuts, booking recovery","By Ilona Wissenbach and Tomasz Janowski
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Germany's Lufthansa said on Thursday recovering air travel and progress on cost savings helped the airline further narrow its losses in the second quarter and record cash inflow for the first time since the start of the coronavirus crisis.
The group, which also owns Eurowings, Swiss, Brussels and Austrian Airlines, reported its adjusted operating loss narrowed to 952 million euros ($1.13 billion) from 1.7 billion euros a year earlier, slightly below the 971 million euros forecast in a company-provided poll.
Lufthansa said the easing of travel curbs and pent-up demand drove significant recovery during the quarter and together with cost savings, which included job cuts, helped stem the cash bleed and deliver a 340 million euro cash inflow. 
""The fact that more than 30,000 colleagues have left us in the process so far hurts us all, but is unavoidable to sustainably save the more than 100,000 remaining jobs,"" Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said in a statement.
Lufthansa shares were up around 0.3% in mid-morning trade.
Bernstein analysts welcomed the progress in restructuring, but noted uncertainty about the group's capital-raising plans.
""There is still no decision around the size and timing of an equity raise, previously planned to be before the election in September – and still top of investors' minds,"" they said in a note.
Lufthansa said its airlines carried 7 million passengers in the quarter, 18% of 2019 levels, though the numbers improved through the quarter to reach 40% at the end of June. Revenues rose 70% from last year to 3.2 billion euros, a touch below analysts' forecast. 
CAUTIOUS OUTLOOK
Rivals, including Air France-KLM and British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) also reported a return to positive cash flow, but like IAG, Lufthansa was more cautious about its outlook than some competitors.
While it predicted high tourist demand and a gradual recovery in business travel in the second half, the group kept its full-year capacity target at 40% of pre-crisis levels and forecast it reaching 50% in the third quarter.
EasyJet and Ryanair, low-cost airlines with no transatlantic routes hit by U.S. curbs on inbound travel, forecast reaching two-thirds of capacity, and Air France-KLM saw it at 60% to 70%. 
Lufthansa, which in June laid out plans to return to profitability with fewer planes and staff than it had before the pandemic, said it had already reached half of the 3.5 billion euros in cost cuts targeted by 2024. That was six months ahead of plan, helped by better than expected uptake of voluntary redundancy programmes in Germany and Switzerland.

The group said its freight business made a record profit, while its service arm returned to the black during the quarter.

""We expect 8% regional index upside in the second half of the year, but the path may be bumpy given the large number of macro concerns,"" it said.
After a rally in the first half of this year, Asian shares faltered in July, hit by rising cases of the more infectious Delta variant of COVID-19 in the region.
Australian companies led the region's upgrades in July as analysts raised their forward 12-month profit estimates 11.5%.
Analysts also raised their earnings estimates for Japanese, Taiwanese and South Korean firms by 2.4%, 2.3% and 0.8% respectively.

""Japanese corporates have piggy-backed on the back of rising global trade. There are still potential upside surprises from inventory restocking, an upswing in global capex and a very sharp turn-around in European growth,"" brokerage Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a report.
South Korean exports jumped to a record high in July, boosted by overseas demand for chips and biohealth products.
According to a Reuters poll, Taiwan's exports have likely risen for a 13th month as the global economy traces its path back to recovery with sustained work-from-home trends.
The earnings upgrades also came on the back of solid second-quarter results posted by Asian companies so far.
Refinitiv data showed 64% of companies that have announced second-quarter results have beaten the forecasts of analysts.

Meanwhile, China, Thailand, Philippine and Malaysian firms faced earnings downgrades in the last month.

Investing.com –  Roku  stock (NASDAQ:ROKU) plunged 9% in Thursday’s premarket trading as the total number of streaming hours on its platform fell in the June quarter and higher cost of raw material dented its margins.
Even as Roku grew its active accounts by 1.5 million to close the quarter with 55.1 million, the platform had to take a hit on the number of hours users streamed programming. After a year of the pandemic when most stayed home and binge watched, online consumption came off with malls and theatres opening and people choosing to step outside.
Users streamed 17.4 billion hours in the second quarter compared to 18.3 billion in the March quarter.
Average revenue per user rose on both sequential and year-on-year basis. It was $36.46, up 46% year-on-year.
The company, which also sells streaming players and its own smart TV, suffered because of tight supply of components and higher shipping costs. It chose to absorb the costs, taking a hit on its margins in the process. Margins ended in the negative, at minus 5.9% from 7.5% in June quarter of 2020.  
Total net revenue grew 81% year-over-year to $645 million as the company was able to monetize more than double last time’s video ad impressions and more media companies used its tools to grow their direct-to-consumer services. Revenue topped the analysts’ expectation of $618.82 million.

PARIS (Reuters) - Pharmaceutical company  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) remains under pressure to launch new drugs and overcome setbacks in the COVID-19 vaccine race, despite a $3.2 billion deal to tighten its grip on promising mRNA technology.
On Tuesday, Sanofi agreed to buy U.S. partner Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO) as it bets on next-generation vaccines and particularly as the French drugmaker, one of the world's top flu vaccine makers, seeks to see off competition in one of its major markets.
The two companies have been partnering since 2018 and are developing a COVID-19 mRNA shot together that has entered clinical trials, as well as an influenza jab. 
The messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid) approach, an area of Translate Bio expertise, instructs human cells to make specific proteins that produce an immune response to a given disease. 
The technology has proven to be successful in COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA). 
""Although the platform of Translate Bio is not yet proven, it is a smart move by Sanofi,"" Wimal Kapadia, an analyst with Bernstein said. ""Bringing the asset in-house will allow them to move quicker.""
The transaction, backed by the U.S. company's largest shareholder, is expected to close in the third quarter. It follows Sanofi's acquisition of another, smaller, mRNA player, Tidal Therapeutics, in April.
But analysts cautioned it won't be enough to ease pressure on chief executive Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD) to revive the company's drug pipeline with a blockbuster product and boost the share price.
Sanofi's shares barely moved on the news on Tuesday and fell to near three-month lows on Wednesday.
""The key for this stock to work is convincing the market that you know how to develop drugs. And bringing in another company or another technology does not really reflect that, and there is a lot of frustration with the stock,"" Kapadia said.
The stock has risen just 1% since the start of the pandemic in March last year while rivals in the COVID-19 vaccine race,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) have seen double-digit percentage growth of 43%, 29% and 22% respectively. (Graphic: Sanofi shares have lagged rivals during pandemic, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjvqkqgqbvx/sanofi.PNG) 
REVAMP
In 2018, the company hired a former Roche executive, John Reed, to revamp its research and development operations. 
Sanofi said last month it expects several pipeline milestones in the second half, including pivotal trial readouts for Amcenestrant, a breast cancer treatment, and Sarclisa for multiple myeloma.
That was followed by Hudson's appointment almost two years ago to reduce the group's focus to fewer but faster-growing segments such as cancer and reduce dependence on Dupixent, its star eczema and asthma treatment that has been leading its growth.
""The CEO is clearly going in the right direction and the Translate Bio deal highlights that,"" a Sanofi investor speaking on the condition of anonymity told Reuters.
""But Hudson's tenure was rapidly overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic and snags with the (COVID-19) vaccine,"" the investor said, referring to delays developing another COVID-19 shot with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).
""Now, we will want to see Sanofi be bolder when it comes to deals if we look at the group's profile in the longer term."" 
That means looking beyond 2025, analysts said.
Martial Descoutures, an analyst with Oddo BFH, said Sanofi's growth profile was well established until then, with Dupixent expected to make ever greater contributions to profits and exceeding 10 billion euros ($11.89 billion) in peak sales.

""(But) we do need more visibility in the longer term. Right now, the pipeline is the main issue.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Vodafone Idea's shares fell to their lowest level in over a year, a day after its billionaire non-executive chairman stepped down, fuelling concerns that the Indian wireless carrier may not survive a hefty bill it owes to the government. 
The company owes roughly 500 billion rupees ($6.74 billion) over the next 10 years for use of the airwaves and in licence fees. India's Supreme Court has not allowed any recalculation of those dues.
In June, Kumar Mangalam Birla, the former non-executive chairman of  Vodafone  (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea, whose resignation was accepted by the company's board on Wednesday, offered to sell his Aditya Birla Group's 27% stake in the telecoms carrier to keep it afloat.
Vodafone Idea was carved in 2018 by combining the Indian operations of Vodafone Group (LON:VOD) and Idea Cellular, which is majority owned by Aditya Birla Group. 
In his June 7 letter to the government, Birla suggested measures to save the company, including clarity on dues Vodafone Idea owed, a moratorium on airwaves payments and a floor price for tariffs.
""I want to emphasise that without immediate active support from the government on these three issues VIL's (Vodafone India Ltd) financial situation will drive its operations to an irretrievable point of collapse,"" Birla wrote.
The government is yet to offer any help to the company. India's telecoms department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Vodafone Idea declined on Birla's departure, and representatives at Aditya Birla Group did not respond to an email from Reuters.
""This is Birla expressing his frustration at the way his pleas for help have been ignored, saying he does not want to helm the demise of a company he created,"" said a former executive at the company.
Vodafone's shares recovered to close little changed on Thursday after falling as much as 24% earlier.
With roughly 10,000 direct employees and loans from banks of nearly 300 billion rupees, Vodafone Idea's potential exit would send shockwaves through India's economy.

""In case Vodafone goes under, the biggest loser in this will be the government, because a major chunk of the debt is owed to them. So the ball is now in their court,"" said a senior banker at a private bank which has lent money to Vodafone Idea.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>",Ashley to quit Frasers CEO role but keep it in the family,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -Mike Ashley, one of Britain's best known and most outspoken business leaders, is set to step down as chief executive of the sportswear retail group he founded nearly 40 years ago, handing the baton to his daughter's partner.
Passing on the CEO position to his future son-in-law, Michael Murray, is a typically unconventional move from Ashley.
His frank comments about rivals and politicians, a love of casinos, stories of settling banker fees by playing bar games and clips on YouTube showing him sinking a pint of beer in a few seconds have fed an image of a maverick far removed from the typical British business chief.
Frasers Group, formerly called  Sports Direct  (LON:FRAS), announced the move on Thursday, saying that its board was in talks to ""transition"" the CEO role from Ashley to Murray, the group's current ""head of elevation"" over the course of the 2021-22 financial year.
""It is currently proposed that Michael Murray will assume the role of CEO on 1 May 2022,"" Frasers said.
Ashley, 56, is not, however, going away. Frasers said that if he did give up the CEO role he would remain on the board as an executive director. He also retains 64% of the group's equity.
Ashley, who started out with a sports store in a town west of London in the 1980s, took over the CEO role in 2016. That was the same year that lawmakers criticised the group for ""Victorian"" working conditions and investors and media highlighted its poor corporate governance.
Sports Direct responded by becoming more open and told workers they would receive back pay after wages fell short of a legal minimum.
Ashley had held the title of executive deputy chairman when Sports Direct floated in 2007 until 2016.
He is also the owner of Premier League soccer club Newcastle United but is unpopular with some supporters who are demanding more investment and has been trying to sell the club.
GOING UP
Though Murray, 31, does not currently sit on Frasers' board, his job has made him central to the group's plans to modernise and go upmarket - the elevation strategy.
Ashley's long-stated desire is to make Frasers the ""Selfridges of sport"", emulating the status of the London department store. It had previously had a reputation for selling goods at bargain prices in large warehouse-style stores.
“Ashley has often been unpredictable, outspoken and uncooperative, so Murray might bring a sense of order to the boardroom,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
Shares in Frasers were down 0.9% at 1005 GMT, paring 2021 gains to 35%.
Frasers reported a 29.4% rise in core earnings in the year to April 25 as a strong online performance offset a hit from store closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were 390.8 million pounds, up from 302.1 million pounds in 2019-20, despite an 8.4% decline in revenue to 3.6 billion pounds.
Property impairment charges of 317 million pounds meant reported pretax profit fell 94.1% to 8.5 million pounds.
Frasers said its UK stores have performed above expectations since reopening after lockdown and its online operation has continued to ""significantly outperform"" pre-COVID-19 periods.

However, it said it was not giving guidance for the 2021-22 year due to uncertainty caused by the pandemic.
""Management remains of the view that there is a high risk of future Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, likely to be over this Winter and maybe beyond,"" it said. ($1 = 0.7207 pounds)

(Reuters) - Germany's Evonik Industries raised its outlook after beating second-quarter earnings forecasts on Thursday but its shares fell as analysts pointed to bigger gains at rival chemical makers.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) adjusted for one-offs rose 42% to 649 billion euros, topping the 633 million forecast in a company-provided poll.
""Evonik's second-quarter beat was less than at other EU chemicals,"" Baader Helvea analyst Markus Meyer said, but added that the company's defensive portfolio meant its earnings declined less during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""Due to increased raw material prices, the profit margin in the past quarter fell short of expectations,"" a local trader said. 
Evonik shares fell 2.7% as of 0945 GMT.
The company raised its 2021 EBITDA outlook to 2.3-2.4 billion euros ($2.7-2.8 billion) from 2.1-2.3 billion euros.
In July, Dutch peer DSM and German competitor BASF raised their 2021 forecasts backed by strong sales and demand from industrial customers.
Evonik, whose materials are used in products ranging from animal feed to Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, is in the middle of a strategic shift towards higher margin specialty chemicals that has helped it ride out the pandemic. 
It said its second-quarter earnings were driven by a post-lockdown rebound in the construction, consumer goods and automotive industries, helped by improved pricing in animal nutrition and steady growth in the healthcare business.

Evonik shares are up 8.5% this year, outperforming German peers such as Lanxess and BASF but lagging Dutch rival DSM.

David J. Kostin and his colleagues raised the end-2021 target to 4,700 after the benchmark U.S. index surpassed their earlier prediction of 4,300 about a month ago, according to a note. This implies a return of about 7% from current levels for the remainder of the year and is the highest forecast in the monthly Bloomberg survey of Wall Street strategists.
The strong earnings season has been driving U.S. stocks to all-time highs, outweighing concerns about the delta variant, China’s crackdown and possible scaling back of monetary stimulus. Goldman strategists today boosted their earnings-per-share estimates to $207 from $193 for this year, implying a whopping 45% annual growth.
“The combination of higher-than-expected S&P 500 earnings and lower-than-expected interest rates drive our upgraded price targets,” the Goldman strategists said. “Relative to consensus, we expect stronger revenue growth and more pretax profit margin expansion as firms successfully manage costs and as high-margin tech companies become a larger share of the index.”
Corporates and households will be the largest buyers of U.S. stocks, thanks to surging buybacks and elevated cash holdings, according to Goldman. Investors should balance their portfolios with long-term growth stocks allocations and short-term tactical bets in virus-exposed sectors.
The strategists also increased their end-2022 S&P 500 target to 4,900 from 4,600. This signals more limited upside for the benchmark, with a return of about 4.3% for the year. The increase in earnings is also expected to slow down next year, with 2% annual EPS growth, they said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JAB Holding Co is carving Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) out into a new unit that will also include Caribou Coffee, Einstein Bros Bagels and other brands to help the chains expand as they emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, Panera Chief Executive Officer Niren Chaudhary told Reuters.
The new group, to be called Panera Brands, combined will have nearly 4,000 locations in 10 countries.
The new structure, which Panera will announce later on Thursday, is the kind of maneuver companies sometimes make ahead of a deal like an initial public offering or sale.
Chaudhary, who will lead the new group while retaining his position at Panera Bread, declined to comment on an IPO or sale but said that ""we are always exploring opportunities.""
JAB is a $120 billion, family-owned Luxembourg-based consumer private equity firm that also owns major stakes in Keurig Dr. Pepper and beauty company Coty (NYSE:COTY) Inc.
In June, it spun off its Krispy Kreme Inc doughnut business, which went public at a $2.7 billion valuation.
In May 2020 its JDE Peet's coffee chain went public at 2.25 billion euros.
All the Panera Brand companies ""have really strengthened their respective brands, teams and business models through the pandemic,"" Chaudhary said in an interview. ""We can collectively leverage the runway of growth."" 
Each company will remain independent and retain its own chief executive officer, app and loyalty program. But they plan to collaborate on menu and beverage development, data analytics, suppliers and other areas, Chaudhary said.

""We can help propel the brands faster because of this infrastructure we have,"" he said. 
The group plans to open new cafes and so-called ghost kitchens for delivery only, to open locations in new countries and to explore consumer packaged goods.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) shares fell to their lowest levels in more than seven months after the German agricultural and pharmaceuticals group reported lower-than-expected second-quarter core earnings due to higher production costs and currency headwinds.
Second-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) before special items fell 10.6% to 2.58 billion euros ($3.05 billion), missing the 2.79 billion forecast analysts had expected on average.
Shares in the group fell by as much as 6.1% to the bottom of the DAX, hitting their lowest since Dec. 21, 2020, after second-quarter adjusted EBITDA at Bayer's Crop Science division declined by more than a quarter.
""Higher prices and volumes, along with contributions from ongoing efficiency programmes only partly offset an increase in costs,"" Bayer said in a statement.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said investors might be concerned by the impact of cost inflation at the Crop Science division, which includes the Roundup weedkiller brand Bayer acquired as part of the $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON).
The decline in core earnings overshadowed Bayer's lifted full-year outlook, following stronger sales of prescription medicines that recovered from restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bayer expects sales of 43 billion euros this year, up from 41 billion earlier. EBITDA before special items is seen at 10.6 billion to 10.9 billion euros, compared with 10.5 billion to 10.8 billion previously.
The more optimistic outlook was partly driven by Bayer's pharmaceuticals division, where second-quarter sales rose 16.2% and which is being strengthened by the acquisition of Vividion Therapeutics for up to $2 billion.
""Vividion's unique technologies and special expertise will significantly strengthen our drug discovery capabilities,"" Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann said in a statement.
Bayer last week said it would book additional provisions of $4.5 billion related to litigation, which alleges that Roundup can cause cancer, bringing the total to $16.1 billion.

Bayer said it would file in August a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking a review of a lower court ruling that went in favour of Roundup user Edwin Hardeman.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) felt the impact of a Chinese boycott of Western brands on its second-quarter results on Thursday and is also suffering from the closure of factories in major supplier Vietnam due to rising COVID-19 infections.
The German sportswear company still raised its outlook for full-year sales and profitability as it said it has seen demand recover in China since calls for a boycott in late March, and said it hopes to restore production in Vietnam soon.
But Adidas shares were down 4.1% by 0950 GMT as analysts noted that its growth was lagging rivals  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Puma, which both reported that sales nearly doubled in recent earnings releases. 
Second-quarter sales at Adidas rose 52% to 5.077 billion euros ($6 billion), while operating profit came in at 543 million euros, ahead of analysts' average forecasts.
Adidas raised its 2021 outlook to predict sales will grow up to 20%, and net income from continuing operations will reach 1.4-1.5 billion euros. That compared to Puma's forecast for sales to rise at least 20% for 2021.
The new Adidas outlook assumes that the sourcing network will be back to normal by the end of September and that the company will continue to see a steady recovery in Greater China, where sales fell 16% in the second quarter.
Western brands including Adidas faced online attacks in China in late March over past statements saying they would not source cotton from Xinjiang after reports of human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims. Beijing denies any such abuses.
Adidas already saw online sales return to growth in China in June, Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told journalists, adding he expects the country to record strong growth for the full year and he welcomed a government drive to promote youth sport.
The company hopes to be able to restart production in Vietnam after the scheduled end of a coronavirus lockdown on Aug. 15 and is working on reallocating production to other centres in the meantime.
Vietnam usually accounts for 28% of Adidas sourcing and its factories mostly make shoes for the company, with a lag of three to four months before products hit the shelves.
The combined impact of supply chain problems, new COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia and tensions with China could amount to more than 500 million euros in lost sales in the second half, said finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer.

Ohlmeyer added he expects Adidas to seal a deal to divest the underperforming Reebok brand by the end of the summer.

The owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and GroupM agencies said on Thursday underlying net sales surged 19.3% in the second quarter. That boosted the first-half total to 4.90 billion pounds ($6.82 billion), up 11% year-on-year and up 0.5% on 2019.

ZURICH (Reuters) -German engineering and technology company Siemens raised its profit guidance on Thursday for the third time this year on the back of a post-pandemic surge in demand. 
The trains-to-industrial software maker is seeing a broad-based increase in demand as customers around the world rebuild their inventories and vaccination campaigns have accelerated the economic recovery.
The Munich company said orders surged 47%, driven by a strong upswing in areas like automotive, machine building and electronics, while previously hard-hit aerospace and defence sectors were showing signs of improvement.
Siemens raised its profit guidance again after beating forecasts for sales, profit and orders.
""In the third quarter, once again we delivered – with strong and profitable growth in all businesses,"" said Chief Executive Roland Busch, who replaced longstanding CEO Joe Kaeser in February.
The company was continuing to add to bolt-on acquisitions, particularly in the software and digital space, Busch said.
Siemens announced on Thursday a 550 million euro deal to buy rail software company Sqills, part of the company's strategy expand into high growth markets next to its core activities.
During the three months to the end of June, Siemens said adjusted operating profit at its industrial business rose 29% to 2.32 billion euros ($2.75 billion), beating the 2.09 billion euros in a company-gathered consensus of analyst forecasts.
Revenue rose 24% to 16.09 billion euros, while orders surged 47% to 20.49 billion euros, both beating forecasts.
It now expects its full-year revenue to rise by 11% to 12%, up from its previous view for an increase of 9% to 11%, boosted by higher sales of its factory automation and smart infrastructure businesses.
Restocking by customers worried about shortages was playing a role in the upturn, although the main driver was the economic recovery, Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told reporters.
""If you had a growth momentum of 100%, you can probably attribute something between 7% to 10 % of that to extraordinary behaviour,"" Thomas said. ""That is my gut feeling.""
Net income for the year to the end of September is now expected to be in the range of 6.1-6.4 billion euros. The company had previously guided to a range of 5.7-6.2 billion euros. 
Siemens' shares, which have lagged the performance of rivals like France's Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) and Switzerland's ABB in recent weeks, were up 3.7% in early trading on the Germany's bluechip DAX index. 
Both Schnieider and ABB have also upped their outlooks recently.

""We see potential for a catchup in the medium term given the strong topline momentum that goes beyond 'growth on easy comps' with Q3 2021 revenues were 9% above the pre-pandemic level,"" said JP Morgan analyst Andreas Willi said about Siemens.

(Reuters) - British mall operator Hammerson reported an improvement in adjusted earnings for the first half compared with a crisis-hit 2020, but warned on Thursday that footfall was yet to rebound to levels seen before the pandemic.
Hammerson, like other mall operators that are heavily exposed to non-essential retail tenants, was battered by months of COVID-19 lockdowns over the past year and a half. 
With rents still behind pre-pandemic levels, the industry is facing a tough outlook after the British government extended a ban on commercial evictions until March 2022, while some regions like France are reimposing restrictions amid new virus variants. 
Hammerson and its rival British Land have said they will no longer give rent concessions to tenants.
Hammerson's IFRS loss narrowed to 376 million pounds ($523 million) for the six months through June compared with 1.09 billion a year earlier, while adjusted earnings improved to 20.1 million pounds from 17.7 million. 
Before the health crisis, the company, which runs shopping malls such as the Bullring in Birmingham and Italie Deux in Paris, had reported 107.4 million pounds in adjusted earnings and a loss of 319.8 million pounds on an IFRS basis. 
Hammerson exited the UK retail park sector earlier this year, selling seven sites to Brookfield Asset Management for 330 million pounds to shore up its finances after the crisis pushed it to a 1.7 billion pounds loss for 2020.
Its EPRA net tangible assets per share, a key metric for the sector, fell 16% to 69 pence as footfall was averaging 75% of 2019 levels. 
Shares of the company, a member of the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies, fell 2.5% by 0730 GMT. 
JP Morgan analysts noted that the net asset value decline of 6% was a slower pace than the previous year, adding investors would be looking for progress on potential French disposals.

Hammerson Chief Executive Rita-Rose Gagné said: ""We are focused on continuing to de-lever the balance sheet through disposals of non-core assets, creating a leaner and more agile organisation.""

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 46.7% to 1.6 billion euros ($1.89 billion), above the consensus estimate of 1.46 billion euros in a poll of analysts provided by the company.
“We have succeeded in mobilizing for accelerated, efficient growth in all business sectors,"" said CEO Belen Garijo, highlighting the contribution of Merck's three main divisions - Healthcare, Life Science and Electronics.
""We are poised to deliver sustainable growth due to our optimal position to address all Covid and post-Covid macro trends,” she added. Merck shares rallied by 3.7% on the results, extending year-to-date gains to 30%.
Reported group sales increased by 18.2% in the quarter and by 23% when adjusted for currency movements. EBITDA grew by 53% on an organic basis.
Commenting on the outlook, Merck said it expected the recovery that began in late 2020 to continue, while Life Sciences in particular would expect ""significantly positive contributions"" owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Merck now expects group net sales to grow in 2021 by 12%-14%, on an organic basis, up from a previous forecast of 10%-12%. It now sees adjusted EBITDA rising by 21%-25%, up from an earlier view of 16%-20% growth.
Should governments order vaccine booster shots to counter new COVID-19 variants that would lift revenue at Merck, CFO Markus Kuhnert told reporters on a call, while further lockdowns that could weigh on sales were unlikely.
Commenting on the mid-term outlook, Merck dialed back its expectations for revenues from pipeline sales in its Healthcare division to 1.6-1.8 billion euros next year from 2 billion euros previously.
This was mainly due to lower expectations for sales of its Mavenclad treatment for multiple sclerosis. Merck still expects Mavenclad to achieve peak sales of 1-1.4 billion euros, although this would be later than earlier expected.
LIFE SCIENCES LEAD 
Merck's Life Science unit, mostly made up of businesses formerly known as Millipore and Sigma Aldrich, cemented its role as Merck's main growth driver, achieving an organic revenue increase of 28.2% and half of group profits.

(Reuters) - Weber Inc on Thursday raised about $250 million in its initial public offering, which was less than half the amount it had planned to raise earlier.
The grill maker priced its IPO of about 17.9 million shares at $14 a piece, it said in a statement. 
Weber last month had planned to sell 46.88 million shares at between $15 and $17 each, which would have helped it raise up to $797 million at a valuation of about $5 billion.
The Palatine, Illinois-based company, whose grill types include gas, electric and charcoal, debuts on Thursday, about a week after rival wood pellet grill maker Traeger Inc started trading on the NYSE. 
It was founded by George Stephen Sr, who invented the Weber Kettle — a dome-shaped charcoal grill — about 70 years ago.

BDT Capital Partners, a U.S. fund run by Warren Buffett's banker Byron Trott, holds a controlling interest in the company in partnership with the Stephen family and management.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), BofA Securities and J.P. Morgan are among the underwriters for the offering.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 03:11AM ET</span>",Marketmind: A time to taper,"A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao. 
Earlier this week, the Reserve Bank of Australia didn't blink and stuck with plans to taper bond-buying stimulus next month. But the Bank of England today is unlikely to say it judges the economy strong enough to stomach an early end to its 875 billion-pound stimulus.
Two BOE policymakers have broken ranks to suggest bond-buying should end soon. Yet the bank will be mindful that the pandemic safety net is being dismantled and the COVID threat hasn't gone away.
Not much action on sterling before the meeting, but the dollar is at one-week highs after two Fed policymakers Robert Kaplan and Richard Clarida spoke in favour of tapering QE this year, with the latter predicting ""pretty healthy"" U.S job gains which would allow an interest rate liftoff in 2023.
Ten-year Treasuries have inched back to 1.20% after falling as low as 1.127% on Wednesday while inflation-adjusted yields also are off record lows.
Stocks are mostly flatlining, after the S&P 500 closed off record highs, pressured by the Fed remarks as well as data showing weaker July jobs growth. 
In China, it was the turn of vaping firms' shares to tumble, following reports that minors were purchasing e-cigarettes; these dragged the broader index 0.6% lower. Strong earnings and a tech rally boosted Japanese stocks though record new virus cases and more activity curbs dampened sentiment.
The earnings season in Europe and United States too is winding down on a strong note. Lufthansa, Merck, Siemens, Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) and fashion retailer Zalando were among those delivering good news. 
Finally, as the likes of BOE and the Fed consider taper timings, rate hikes are proceeding at full tilt in the developing world -- Brazil has upped rates by a full percentage point and on Thursday, the Czech central bank could implement a quarter-point rate rise.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday: 
-Emerging markets: Egypt, Czech central banks meet
-Bank of England meeting
-German industrial orders
U.S. trade balance/initial jobless claims
-Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller speaks on CBDCs

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's financial-crime agency has asked Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Flipkart and its founders to explain why they shouldn't face a penalty of $1.35 billion for alleged violation of foreign investment laws, three sources and an agency official told Reuters.
The Enforcement Directorate agency has been investigating e-commerce giants Flipkart and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) for years for allegedly bypassing foreign investment laws that strictly regulate multi-brand retail and restrict such companies to operating a marketplace for sellers.
The Enforcement Directorate official, who declined to be named, said the case concerned an investigation into allegations that Flipkart attracted foreign investment and a related party, WS Retail, then sold goods to consumers on its shopping website, which was prohibited under law.
A so-called ""show cause notice"" was issued in early July by the agency's office in southern city of Chennai to Flipkart, its founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal as well as current investor Tiger Global, to explain why they should not face a fine of 100 billion rupees ($1.35 billion) for the lapses, said the agency official and the sources, who are all familiar with the content of the notice.
The details were first reported by Reuters. 
A Flipkart spokesperson said the company is ""in compliance with Indian laws and regulations"". 
""We will cooperate with the authorities as they look at this issue pertaining to the period 2009-2015 as per their notice,"" the spokesperson added. 
The Indian agency does not make public such notices issued to parties during an investigation. 
One of the sources said Flipkart and others have around 90 days to respond to the notice. WS Retail ceased operations at the end of 2015, the person added.
Tiger Global declined to comment. Binny Bansal and Sachin Bansal did not respond to requests for comment. The Enforcement Directorate also did not respond to a request for comment. 
Walmart took a majority stake in Flipkart for $16 billion in 2018, its biggest deal ever. Sachin Bansal sold his stake to Walmart at the time, while Binny Bansal retained a small stake. Walmart did not respond to a request for comment.
Flipkart's valuation doubled to $37.6 billion in less than 3 years at a $3.6 billion funding round in July, during which SoftBank Group reinvested in the company ahead of an expected market debut.
The notice is the latest regulatory headache for the online retailer, which is already facing tougher restrictions and antitrust investigations in India, and a growing number of complaints from smaller sellers.
India's brick-and-mortar retailers say Amazon and Flipkart favour select sellers on their platforms and use complex business structures to bypass the foreign investment laws, hurting smaller players. The companies deny any wrongdoing.
SMALL RETAILERS WELCOMES AGENCY MOVE 
The Indian agency's move was welcomed on Thursday by Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders.
""We urge the ED (Enforcement Directorate) to not only impose a heavy fine but recommend the government ban both these portals unless they follow the law in letter and spirit,"" said Khandelwal. The confederation represents millions of mom-and pop stores in India. 

In February, a Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation based on Amazon documents showed it had given preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers, publicly misrepresented ties with them and used them to bypass Indian law. Amazon says it gives no preferential treatment to any seller.
After the story, the Enforcement Directorate sought information and documents from Amazon about its business operations, Reuters has reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-india-operations-idUSKBN2B41F6.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore's DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Holdings flagged strong loan growth and lower credit costs ahead after a rebound in its mainstay home market fuelled a better-than-expected 37% jump in quarterly net profit for Southeast Asia's biggest lender.
The bank joined local peers OCBC and United Overseas Bank (OTC:UOVEY) in reporting strong results, but the sector's sequential performance slowed sharply, underscoring challenges to maintaining growth.
""Overall numbers were OK considering net interest margins have fallen over 40 basis points from pre-COVID levels as rates fell, with the fee side largely expected,"" said Kevin Kwek, a senior analyst at Stanford C. Bernstein, commenting on DBS.
DBS shares rose as much as 1.2% on Thursday to a record S$30.95 in a weak market. The stock is up 23% so far this year.
HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) have also reduced credit losses in a global economic recovery after booking huge provisions last year in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
""It was a strong first half of the year and we go into the back end of the year with a fairly high degree of confidence,"" DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, 61, told an online news conference.
The bank raised its dividend payout after Singapore's central bank last week removed caps on bank dividends, citing the improving global economic outlook.
As Singapore's economy rebounds from its worst-ever recession, demand for home mortgages and loans has improved, while booming markets have bolstered banks' wealth management businesses. This helped them cushion the impact of weak net interest margins in a low interest rate environment.
DBS reported profit for April-June rose to S$1.7 billion from S$1.25 billion a year earlier and beat an average estimate of S$1.42 billion from five analysts, according to Refinitiv data. Profit fell 15% from a record first quarter.
This was the 10th consecutive quarter that the bank has reported higher-than-expected profit.
Under Gupta, who took charge in 2009, DBS has broken into the ranks of the top wealth managers in Asia, acquired two banks, in India and China, over the past year, and is making forays into businesses such as a digital exchange and a global carbon exchange as it seeks new revenue streams amid low interest rates.

Provisions for potential loan losses declined to S$79 million from S$849 million a year earlier, and DBS reduced its forecast for full-year credit costs.

SEATTLE/BEIJING (Reuters) - A Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 Max jet departed for China on Wednesday to conduct a flight test as part of the U.S. planemaker's attempt to gain approval in the vital travel market following two fatal crashes, people familiar with the matter said.
Flight-tracking site FlightRadar24 showed a 737 MAX 7 test plane taking off from Boeing Field near Seattle at 8:17 a.m. local time (1517 GMT). It landed in John Rodgers Field outside Honolulu nearly 5.5 hours later to complete the first leg of its trip across the Pacific.
Boeing and China regulators have scheduled re-certification flights and testing in the coming days, the people said. 
The test plane, which lacks the range for a direct flight, is expected to arrive at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport on Aug. 7, ahead of a simulator test on Aug. 8 and if all goes well a first flight test in China on Aug. 11, one of the people said. 
The sources declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak publicly about the matter.
A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment on the flight and referred questions to regulators. ""Boeing continues to work with global regulators as they complete their validation processes in order to better understand enhancements to the airplane,"" the spokesperson said.
Civil Aviation Administration of China did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Some 30 airlines and 175 countries have allowed the 737 MAX to return to service following a nearly two year safety ban after crashes five months apart killed 346 people, plunging Boeing into a financial crisis long-since compounded by the global coronavirus pandemic. 
Boeing's 737 MAX remains grounded in China, where trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have cut off sales for years, though Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said last week he still expects the 737 MAX to win approval before year-end.

Before the 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019 after a second fatal crash, Boeing was selling one quarter of the planes it built annually to China buyers. For years, simmering geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing have caused uncertainty.
Industry sources have also cautioned that the worsening COVID-19 pandemic situation in China may delay the planned testing.

WeChat, which already has more than 1 billion users, halted signups last week to undergo a “security technical upgrade” to comply with regulations. The company said at the time it expected to resume new individual user registrations around early August. A company representative confirmed user reports on social media Thursday about the resumption.
A series of state media pronouncements this week have stoked fears Beijing will next train its attention on the gaming sector and its most dominant player, Tencent. China’s most valuable corporation fell as much as 11% after an outlet run by the Xinhua News Agency called games “spiritual opium” -- a loaded term since removed from online posts. The Communist Party’s flagship newspaper, the People’s Daily, toned down that rhetoric a day later but reinforced the need to fight addiction, underscoring that reining in the giant industry remains a priority.
WeChat -- a fixture in daily Chinese life for everything from hailing a cab to ordering meals and paying utilities bills -- plays a central role in funneling traffic to and showcasing Tencent’s businesses. Its services however largely walls off users on platforms operated by its rivals, such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s main shopping sites. The user suspensions affected only its Chinese service -- dubbed Weixin locally -- which also accounts for the bulk of its global users.
The user suspensions coincided with a notice from the internet industry overseer that warned it was kicking off a six-month campaign to rectify illegal behavior online, including the blocking of external links as well as the collection and storage of data.

Tencent was down more than 1% at the lunch break. Concerns about the gaming sector come after a tumultuous few weeks of regulatory action against Didi Global Inc. and the $100 billion after-school tutoring industry that at one point wiped out more than $1 trillion of market value from Chinese stocks. Shenzhen-based Tencent, responding to Tuesday’s blistering critique, has pledged to curb game time and even broached a sweeping ban on gaming for kids.
But on Thursday, an influential newspaper based in Shenzhen -- Tencent’s home base -- fanned the uncertainty by arguing that the government should stop handing out tax breaks to gaming companies because they’ve become global players that thrive on their own.
Beijing’s campaign to rein in its giant internet industry is entering its 10th month, a roller-coaster ordeal that’s prompting nervous investors to ponder the longer-term ramifications of a crackdown on firms from Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. and Alibaba to Tencent-backed food delivery giant Meituan and Didi.
Those actions demonstrated Beijing’s resolve to go after private enterprises to address social inequities, seize control of data it deems crucial to the economy and stability, and rein in powerful interests.

Huabao International Holdings Ltd tumbled 8% in morning trade, while China Boton Group Co Ltd fell 4%. Relx Technology Inc closed almost 5% lower in New York after the report by Xinhua news agency was published. 
Xinhua news agency said its reporters made unannounced visits to e-cigarette shops in the northern cities of Tianjin and Shenyang and found that while all had signs stating sales to minors were prohibited, enforcement of the law varied in practice.
One unidentified salesperson told Xinhua their store did not typically ask for proof of age, unless the customer was obviously very young.
Another vendor contacted by Xinhua on the social media platform WeChat did not ask for the buyer's age or ID.
""E-cigarettes pose a safety hazard to minors, and further efforts should be made to crack down on the sale of e-cigarettes to minors,"" Xinhua quoted Fu Jia, director of Tianjin Lawyers Association's professional committee for the protection of minors.
The Xinhua report comes as Chinese authorities have cited the need to improve the protection of minors and other state media have criticised the video gaming sector. 
Regulators this year have also upended norms for the technology, education and property sectors, putting investors on edge over what other industries may next be in line for further oversight.

E-cigarettes can be used as a way to quit smoking tobacco but they also contain addictive nicotine. The World Health Organization warned in a report last month they ""may act as a 'gateway' to tobacco consumption"" for young people.
China is the world's largest consumer of tobacco products with more than 300 million smokers, according to the WHO report.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Thursday morning. Shares in the region steadied after U.S. counterparts fell. Investors also continued to digest mixed economic data and caution-tinged comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve about the schedule for asset tapering and interest rate hikes.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.31% by 10:49 PM ET (2:49 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.05%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.23%. Trade data released earlier in the day said that exports rose 4% month-on-month in June, imports grew 1% month-on-month and the trade balance stood at AUD10.496 billion.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.10%. China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.12% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.47%.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 fell from a record during the previous session thanks to a dip in energy shares, while the tech sector proved more resilient. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields were on an upward trend.
Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said on Wednesday that the Fed is on track to hike interest rates in 2023 and announce its plans for asset tapering later in 2021. His comments also helped to cement market bets for an initial interest rate hike in early 2023.
U.S. economic data released as Clarida was speaking said the ADP non-farm employment change was at 330,000 in July, lower than expected. The services purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 59.9, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) non-manufacturing employment was at 53.8 and the ISM non-manufacturing PMI was at 64.1.
Investors now look to Friday’s U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, to gauge the Fed’s next move.
Although Clarida remained optimistic about the outlook, he admitted that the continuous increase in COVID-19 cases involving the Delta variant globally is a big downside risk. The number of COVID-19 cases globally topped 200 million as of Aug. 5, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Clarida’s colleagues at the Fed also expressed their views. St. Louis President James Bullard stuck to the central bank's mantra that the jump in U.S. inflation will be temporary but added it will be “more persistent” than expected. Meanwhile, Dallas President Robert Kaplan called for asset tapering to begin gradually if the labor market continues to make progress in its recovery.
In other central bank news, the Bank of England (BOE) will hand down its policy decision later in the day, with the Reserve Bank of India’s decision following on Friday.
Global shares remained close to record levels as investors weigh the Fed outlook, strong corporate earnings and challenges to the economic recovery from COVID-19. The ongoing regulatory crackdown in China, impacting sectors such as private education and technology, also remains a focal point.
Some investors remained cautious.
“The market’s signaing we’re not out of the woods yet... on the other hand, we’ve had a very strong year. It’s rational for the market to take a deep breath,” Grace Capital president and chief investment officer Cate Faddis told Bloomberg."

The stock has risen far above its initial public offering price of $38 per share and has logged its fourth straight day of gains. 
Its market capitalization rose to $58.8 billion, catapulting it ahead of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and asset manager T.

It was unclear exactly how much of Wednesday's buying was from retail investors, though. On Tuesday, retail trading volume rose tenfold, helping the stock gain 24%, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research. Over the past 24 hours, Robinhood was by far the most mentioned stock on WallStreetBets according to sentiment tracker SwaggyStocks.

Wednesday marked the first day that investors could trade options on Robinhood shares, another way of betting on the stock.

Contracts betting on the shares rising above $70 by Aug. 20 were the most actively traded. Puts that come into play if the stocks falls below $20 by mid-August were the next most actively traded contract.

Implied volatility on the stock’s August options stood at around 240% -- indicating that traders expect the stock to move about 15% every day, with a greater-than-30% daily move once every 20 days, according to a note from Christopher Murphy of Susquehanna Investment Group.
Sentiment on Robinhood has also been helped by star stock picker Cathie Wood, who heads the ARK Invest asset management firm. Wood's Ark Fintech Innovation ETF bought another 89,622 shares of Robinhood on Tuesday, and the stock now amounts to about 0.9% of its portfolio, according to a summary of the fund's daily trading. Wood's flagship ARK Innovation ETF has accumulated nearly 5 million Robinhood shares. ""People are trying to jump on the back of Cathie Wood's vote of confidence in Robinhood shares,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital in New York. ""The catalyst was certainly Cathie Wood putting in a sizable position after everyone was downbeat after the IPO.""

746,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 09:06PM ET</span>",U.S. automakers to say they aspire to up to 50% of EV sales by 2030 -sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Detroit's Big Three automakers plan to announce on Thursday that they aspire to have 40% to 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 be electric models as they call for billions in U.S. government assistance to meet aggressive targets, sources briefed on the matter said.
The White House is planning an event on electric vehicles and fuel economy standards with President Joe Biden and chief executives from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV. The administration this week plans to propose revisions to fuel economy requirements through the 2026 model year.
Biden will deliver remarks at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) on Thursday on the steps his administration is taking to strengthen American leadership on clean cars and trucks, the White House said. It did not say who would attend the event.
""When I say electric vehicles are the future, I’m not joking. Tune in for big news tomorrow,"" Biden wrote in a Twitter post on Wednesday.
The three automakers declined to comment on Wednesday, as did the White House. Some major foreign automakers are also expected to support the aspiration target.
The administration has been pressing automakers to back a voluntary pledge of at least 40% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2030 as it works to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, Reuters reported last week.
Automakers are spending tens of billions of dollars to speed EV adoption, even though U.S. EV sales remain small, with the exception of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's.
Consulting firm AlixPartners in June said investments in electric vehicles by 2025 could total $330 billion, a 41% increase from the firm's comparable five-year investment outlook a year ago. As of now, electric vehicles represent about 2% of total global vehicle sales, and will be about 24% of total sales by 2030, the firm forecast.
Biden has resisted calls from many of his fellow Democrats to set a binding target for EV adoption or to follow California or some countries in setting 2035 as a date to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered light duty vehicles.
Some environmental groups have been calling for enforceable requirements and tough vehicle emissions rules through 2026. 
Automakers' target includes full-battery electric, plug-in electric hybrid vehicles, which also have gasoline engines, and hydrogen fuel cell models, sources said.
The automakers will make clear in a joint statement that the aggressive EV targets are contingent on additional government support for EVs and the charging industry. The sources said the wording of the statement could still change before Thursday.
Biden has called for $174 billion in government spending to boost EVs, including $100 billion in consumer incentives. A bipartisan Senate infrastructure bill includes $7.5 billion for EV charging stations but no money for new consumer incentives.
Last month Stellantis said it was targeting over 40% of U.S. vehicles be low-emission by 2030.
GM has said it aspires to end sales of new U.S. gasoline-powered light duty vehicles by 2035, and said on Wednesday it is focused on full electric vehicles rather than plug-in hybrid vehicles. Ford has said it plans ""at least 40% of our global vehicle volume being all-electric by 2030.""
The United Auto Workers union, which has been involved in White House and automaker discussions in recent weeks, has opposed EV mandates, warning it could put jobs at risk.
In a statement on Wednesday, UAW President Ray Curry said the union supports Biden's efforts to expand EV production, but its focus ""is not on hard deadlines or percentages, but on preserving the wages and benefits that have been the heart and soul of the American middle class.""
This week, U.S. regulators plan to propose revising former President Donald Trump's March 2020 rollback of fuel economy standards. Trump required 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026, well below the 5% yearly boosts set in 2012 by President Barack Obama's administration.
Biden's proposed rules, which would cover 2023-2026, are expected to be similar in overall vehicle emissions reductions to California's 2019 deal with some automakers that aims to improve fuel economy 3.7% annually through 2026, sources told Reuters.
The 2026 requirements are expected to exceed the Obama-era 5% annual improvements.

The United States pledged at a global climate summit this year to reduce emissions 50% to 52% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.
In March, a group of 71 Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives urged Biden to set tough emissions rules to ensure that 60% of new passenger cars and trucks sold are zero-emission by 2030.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed mostly lower on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling from a record high after data signaled a slowdown in jobs growth in July, and General Motors (NYSE:GM) tracked its worst day since early March.
GM's shares slumped 8.9%, underscoring the uncertainty facing global automakers at a time of technological and economic disruption. Shares of rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co fell 5.0%.
Nine of the 11 S&P indexes were lower, with industrials and energy both slipping, as data showed U.S. private payrolls increased far less than expected in July, likely constrained by shortages of workers and raw materials.
The blue-chip Dow, heavily weighted toward economically-sensitive stocks, also declined.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq bucked the trend after another report showed a measure of U.S. services industry activity jumped to a record high last month, suggesting a broader economic rebound was still on track.
""The ADP employment report this morning (is a) big miss ... has people really locked in on tomorrow's initial claims and then Friday's non-farm payrolls report,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. ""To me that’s a big driver (of the market today).""
""Broadly, the continued evolution of COVID-19, the Delta variant over the recent weeks and months kind of re-rating of the growth outlook"" has the market coming to terms with what it means for the reflation trade, and what it means to the bond market, Mayfield said.
After six straight month of gains, the benchmark S&P 500 has struggled to rise in August over concerns about the pace of growth as the economy rebounded from the depths of the COVID-19-driven recession, and fears of higher inflation overshadowed a stellar corporate earnings season.
Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Wednesday the central bank should be in the position to begin raising interest rates in 2023. 
Still, tech and tech-adjacent stocks such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which tend to perform better when interest rates are lower, outperformed the broader market.
Focus now turns to the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Friday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 323.73 points, or 0.92%, to 34,792.67, the S&P 500 lost 20.49 points, or 0.46%, to 4,402.66 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.24 points, or 0.13%, to 14,780.53.
In earnings-related moves, BorgWarner Inc (NYSE:BWA) fell even as it beat profit expectations on strong consumer demand for new vehicles, while Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co tumbled after warning of margin pressure from higher prices of ingredients.
 Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) jumped 50.4% as interest from star fund manager Cathie Wood and small-time traders set up the stock for a fourth session of gains after its underwhelming market debut last week.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.78 billion shares, compared with the 9.71 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.82-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 67 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 107 new lows.

748,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 07:30PM ET</span>","Chesapeake Energy’s future muddied by executive departures, strategy shifts","By Liz Hampton
(Reuters) -When U.S. oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) emerged from bankruptcy in February, it touted to investors a clean balance sheet, a new board of directors and a promise to restrain spending.
Since then, the company has endured a senior management shakeup and, according to two sources familiar with the matter, its interim CEO has told employees that the company is eyeing acquisitions that could help double its size. 
The mixed signals, say some investors, shed light on why Chesapeake's stock rise has lagged that of rivals. One problem is that no one is exactly sure of the company's real post-bankruptcy strategy.
Chesapeake's stock has gained about 21% since the company emerged from bankruptcy. But shares of rivals Antero Resources (NYSE:AR) Corp and  Range Resources Corp  (NYSE:RRC) have climbed about 67% and 53%, respectively, in the same period. Natural gas prices, meanwhile, have soared about 43% to $4.06 per million British thermal units.
Investor confidence in Chesapeake’s reboot began to flag in April after then-director Michael Wichterich unexpectedly fired CEO Doug Lawler, who had headed Chesapeake for eight years, and took over his position on an interim basis.
Lawler had been widely credited with whittling away the company’s $13 billion debt load with a conservative approach to spending and had shepherded the company through bankruptcy.
In a town hall meeting shortly after the firing, Wichterich told employees that he had a knack for deal-making and recited a litany of deals he had closed on over the course of his career, according to two sources who attended the meeting. He then told them Chesapeake needed to grow or it would become an acquisition target, according to the sources, who added he has mentioned doubling the size of the company. 
""That freaked a lot of people out,"" said one of the sources, who asked not to be named discussing the matter. 
Chesapeake did not make Wichterich available for an interview and declined to comment for this story. 
Around the time of the town hall, and in contrast to what Wichterich had told employees, sources told Reuters that the company’s new, post-bankruptcy board was considering selling off the company’s properties in South Texas.
In June, three other top executives - Chesapeake’s general counsel, chief accountant and vice president of exploration and production - left. They had all been a part of Lawler's team. 
ROUGH RIDE
Chesapeake was once the second-largest U.S. gas producer. It fell into bankruptcy after years of overspending on acquisitions that left it cash-strapped and unable to tap vast resources.
It also suffered a morale-sapping scandal. Its founder, Aubrey McClendon, died in a fiery car crash in 2016 a day after he was indicted by a federal grand jury for rigging natural gas leasing bids.
Now, the company’s massive campus in Oklahoma City is full of vacancies due to staff losses. 
Although it is not uncommon to replace a CEO after bankruptcy, Lawler was well-liked by Wall Street and had won praise for keeping the debt-laden business afloat for years.
Chesapeake has said the search for a new, permanent CEO to replace him may take several months. 
Under his current compensation plan, Wichterich received a salary of $61,250 per month through the end of July. That jumped to $204,583.33 per month in August, according to a regulatory filing. 
Not everyone has concerns over Chesapeake Energy's future. One former employee contacted by Reuters said there were plenty of ""brilliant people"" working at Chesapeake who would take the Oklahoma City-based company to the next level. 
And one investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they trusted the decisions made by the board and current management and were happy with the company's financial position. 
Analysts and people close to the company say that deals may be coming, likely in the form of bolt-on additions to the company's natural gas assets, which are viewed as better than its oil properties. Opportunities abound, as several private equity firms are looking to exit the Haynesville and Appalachian shale plays.
But investors this year have punished companies proposing to expand production by acquisition. 
Shares of  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD), for example, dropped 6% in April right after it acquired DoublePoint Energy. Less than two months later,  Cabot Oil & Gas  Corp (NYSE:COG) and  Cimarex Energy  Co (NYSE:XEC) both fell roughly 7% after disclosing a merger. 

Some energy investors would prefer shale companies to figure out how to deliver higher returns on flat investment, said Robert Thummel, managing director for Tortoise, an energy investment firm. 
Thummel previously owned Chesapeake, but said he would need to see ""several quarters' worth of discipline and a clear path for returning capital to shareholders"" before buying it again.

750,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 07:26PM ET</span>",Uber posts $509 million adjusted loss on driver incentives even as trips rise,"By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -Uber Technologies Inc on Wednesday reported widening losses as it spent more to entice drivers to return to its platform, sending shares of the ride-hail and food delivery company down in after-hours trade.
Investors sold the shares despite Uber (NYSE:UBER) management's assurances that the company can deliver a sharp turnaround in profitability even as New York and other major cities reimpose some pandemic restrictions. 
Uber posted an adjusted $509 million second-quarter loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - a metric that excludes one-time costs, including stock-based compensation - widening losses by nearly $150 million from the first quarter. 
Analysts on average had expected the company to report an adjusted EBITDA loss of around $324.5 million, Refinitiv data showed.
Shares were down 5% in after-hours trading after closing the regular session down 2.2%.
The company also warned investors that uncertainty from the Delta variant of the coronavirus continues to impact visibility into recovery. 
But Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi told analysts on a conference call that the company's food delivery business provided a hedge against potential ride-hail declines and that July trends support the company's confidence for the second half of the year.
Gross bookings during the second quarter reached an all-time high of nearly $22 billion, with more passengers returning for trips while food delivery orders also increased.
Nevertheless, the earnings call was dominated by questions over driver supply and the ongoing impact of the pandemic.
Investors are worried about the ongoing shortage of drivers in the industry as demand ramps up. Uber's smaller rival,  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), on Tuesday said it expected limited driver supply to continue in the next quarter, requiring further investments in driver incentives.
Uber said riders returned to its platform in greater numbers in July and it expects the trend to continue in the coming months, together with strong food delivery orders.
Uber reaffirmed its goal of hitting profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis at the end of this year and said it would reduce losses to $100 million in the third quarter.
That assumes the more contagious Delta variant does not reverse a gradual reopening of the U.S. economy, an issue that Lyft said on Tuesday it was monitoring.
Uber on Wednesday said monthly active drivers and food delivery workers had increased by nearly 420,000 from February to July. Passenger wait times in major U.S. cities also decreased during that time, the company said.
Uber spent a massive $250 million in driver incentive investment in the second quarter, which increased losses at its ride-hail business. Uber said mobility profitability will expand significantly as U.S. and Canadian driver investments fade, a trend it has witnessed in Australia and other markets.
U.S. driver supply increased by 30% from June to July, even as incentives were reduced.
""We invested early and aggressively and are seeing very positive momentum,"" Khosrowshahi said.
The company had urged U.S. drivers to take advantage of the incentives before pay drops to pre-COVID-19 levels as more drivers return to the platform.
Total costs and expenses in the second quarter jumped by over 57% to $5.12 billion year over year. 
Uber also took advantage of unrealized gains in its investments in Chinese ride-hail company Didi Global and self-driving company Aurora to post second-quarter net profit of $1.1 billion.
Uber executives said the company might sell some of those positions after clearing regulatory restrictions if the market offered reasonable values for them.
Uber's delivery unit, which includes restaurant delivery service Uber Eats, narrowed losses on a quarterly basis and more than doubled gross bookings from last year.
Overall, the company reported second-quarter revenue of $3.9 billion, beating average analyst estimates of $3.75 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Uber doubled down on Uber Eats, which has been a pandemic winner, by acquiring rival startup Postmates and last-mile alcohol delivery company Drizly.

Uber is also expanding its grocery delivery business, having announced partnerships with Albertsons Companies Inc and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST).
In July, Uber also announced the acquisition of logistics company Transplace for about $2.25 billion in a boon to its freight delivery unit, which is now expected to break even on an adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of 2022.

751,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 06:37PM ET</span>","As Huawei CFO case enters final weeks, lawyer questions information in U.S. extradition request","By Moira Warburton
VANCOUVER (Reuters) -Lawyers making a final push to convince a Canadian court not to recommend the extradition of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Wednesday called into question the reliability of information provided by the United States in its extradition request.
Meng has returned to a Canadian courtroom for the final weeks of her U.S. extradition hearings, as the legal proceedings running more than two years draw to a close.
Meng, 49, was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the United States, charging her with misleading HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran, potentially causing the bank to violate American economic sanctions.
Meng, who has said she is innocent, has been fighting her extradition from under house arrest in Vancouver.
The hearings, expected to last until Aug. 20, will initially focus on the third part of her lawyers' arguments, specifically that U.S. prosecutors materially misrepresented the case against her in their extradition request to Canada.
On Wednesday, defense lawyer Mona Duckett told Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes in the British Columbia Supreme Court that there was no way for her to ""know if the wool has been pulled over (her) eyes"" by the United States in their request for Meng's extradition.
The defense has called the U.S. record of the case ""manifestly unreliable,"" which Canadian prosecutors dispute.
After this stage is completed, hearings will then move to the remedy stage, which will address Meng's allegations that abuses of process occurred during her arrest. After that, a committal hearing, to determine whether there is sufficient evidence against Meng for her to stand trial, will take place.
A decision is widely expected in the autumn.
A spokesperson for Canada's Department of Justice said on Tuesday Meng will continue to be afforded a fair process in accordance with Canadian law.
Huawei said in a statement on Wednesday it ""remains confident"" in Meng's innocence, and added the company will continue to support her defense.
In the days following Meng's arrest, which immediately caused a chill in relations between Ottawa and Beijing, China detained two Canadians - Michael Spavor, a businessman, and Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat. Ottawa has repeatedly pressed Washington for help in pressuring China to release the men.
The context of the case has ""changed significantly"" since Joe Biden became U.S. president in January of this year, said Lynette Ong, an associate professor at the University of Toronto and expert on China.

Biden's return to more traditional modes of diplomacy means that Canada can rely on the United States to advocate for the two Canadians in ways it could not under former President Donald Trump, Ong said.
""Friends have to look out for each other's interests in the Biden era, which wasn't the case during Trump - it was very much a unilateral aggressive approach,"" Ong said.

752,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 06:27PM ET</span>",Petrobras Earnings Jump on Oil Rally and Brazil’s Water Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s state-controlled oil company saw its earnings surge in the second quarter, thanks to a rally in crude prices and a hydropower crunch in Brazil that boosted electricity demand.
Since late last year, Petrobras has sold more fuel oil domestically and increased output at its own thermal power plants, part of a wider policy in Brazil to conserve water levels at hydroelectric dams and avert power outages. Though the energy and power division at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, represents a fraction of overall revenue, it was a standout. Electricity generation more than tripled in the second quarter from a year ago.
Petrobras also got a boost from this year’s oil-price rebound, which has delivered robust earnings to energy giants, many of which are printing as much profit as before the pandemic. As a result, many of Petrobras’s U.S. and European peers have been using the cash to boost dividends and slash debt. It’s a stunning turnaround for an industry that was on the ropes a year ago amid a pandemic-induced price crash.
Also Read: Big Oil Shows Confidence The Era of Large Profits Is Back
Petrobras reported 42.86 billion reais ($8.3 billion) of net income, up from 1.17 billion in the first quarter. Thanks to the strong results, the company said it will bring forward shareholder payouts of 31.6 billion reais for this year.
Petrobras continues to increase oil output from the so-called pre-salt region that holds its largest and most profitable discoveries. A 180,000-barrel-a-day production vessel is expected to start this month and gradually ramp up at the Sepia field. This and other new units allow Petrobras to continue boosting output at ultra-deep fields, and compensate for production it has lost due to asset sales and natural declines at legacy fields.
Petrobras continued to slash what was once the biggest debt load of any publicly traded oil company, which stood at $63.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. The company has vowed to increase dividend payments when it brings total debt below $60 billion, a target it expects to achieve next year. The ongoing divestment program has helped Petrobras trim debt. It has raised $2.8 billion from selling assets for the year through Aug. 3.
It was the first quarter under the management of Chief Executive Officer Joaquim Silva e Luna, a former general who took over in April following a row between President Jair Bolsonaro and the previous CEO about rising diesel prices. Luna has pledged to avoid fuel subsidies and continue with Petrobras’s current business plan, which calls for divesting assets including refineries to focus on its most profitable projects in the pre-salt.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co will invest in Germany's H2 Mobility network of hydrogen fuelling station operators, it said on Thursday, as it looks to support infrastructure for fuel cell-powered vehicles.
A partner in the project since 2017, Hyundai Motor's German subsidiary will become a seventh shareholder shortly, it said, having received approval from Germany's cartel office.
The South Korean company did not disclose financial details.
It joins investors including France's Total, Shell (LON:RDSa), OMV, industrial gas makers Linde (NYSE:LIN) and Air Liquide (OTC:AIQUY), and carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF).

Fuel cell cars are far from mass market production.
But Hyundai, which is introducing fuel cell trucks in Switzerland, believes hydrogen technology could also play a bigger role in small vehicles further down the road.
H2 Mobility operates 91 hydrogen filling stations and is expanding.
H2 Mobility Managing Director Nikolas Iwan said the group was looking for anchor customers to bring big volumes to the stations, hoping this will allow them to reach break even within two to three years.

""This is why Hyundai is so important. They have the lead when it comes to scaling effects, especially in the area of commercial vehicles,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico sued several gun makers in a U.S. federal court on Wednesday, accusing them of reckless business practices that supply what it called a ""torrent"" of illegal arms to violent Mexican drug cartels, leading to thousands of deaths.
The lawsuit alleges that units of Smith & Wesson, Barrett Firearms, Colt's Manufacturing Company, Glock Inc, Sturm, Ruger & Co and others knew their business practices had encouraged illegal arms trafficking into Mexico.
The lawsuit cites weapons that had entered Mexico used in notorious shootings, noting that Colt's .38-caliber ""Emiliano Zapata 1911"" pistol is engraved with the image of the Mexican revolutionary, and is a status symbol coveted by drug cartels.
""What's the objective? That the companies in question compensate Mexico's government for the damage caused by their negligent practices,"" Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said at a news conference about the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
The lawsuit is one of the boldest steps ever taken by Mexico to pressure the U.S. arms industry, which Mexican leaders have for years blamed for fueling gang violence.
Companies needed to put an immediate stop to their harmful practices, Ebrard said, noting that the court would decide what damages should be paid. He spoke after Mexican officials told reporters the lawsuit sought an estimated $10 billion.
The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation Inc (NSSF) said it rejected Mexico's claims that U.S. manufacturers were negligent in their business practices.
""The Mexican government is responsible for the rampant crime and corruption within their own borders,"" Lawrence G. Keane, NSSF's senior vice president, said in a statement. He said cartels use guns taken illegally to Mexico or stolen from Mexican military and law enforcement. 
'ACTIVELY FACILITATING'
Mexico accused the companies of helping to flout its strict gun laws by marketing to the country's criminal underworld, and thereby ""actively facilitating the unlawful trafficking of their guns to drug cartels.""
Mexican officials said they had spent two years analyzing legal precedents over negligence by U.S. arms makers.
They pointed to cases including a recent offer by Remington Arms Co to pay nearly $33 million to families to settle lawsuits claiming that its marketing of firearms contributed to the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre in Connecticut, where 26 people died.
Claims of improper marketing have been used in other lawsuits as an exception to U.S. law that provides legal immunity to the gun industry, and could be pushing companies to become more transparent in explaining their operations. 
""There are efforts that seem to be making some headway to make the gun industry and manufacturers in particular divulge records about how they think about marketing, distribution and sale practices,"" said Timothy Lytton, a professor at the Georgia State University College of Law.
Mexico's lawsuit said over 500,000 guns are trafficked annually from the United States into Mexico, of which more than 68% of them, or over 340,000, are made by the firms in question.
Mexico has suffered record-high homicide rates in recent years.
The weapons trafficked to Mexico were responsible for at least 17,000 murders during 2019 alone, a Mexican official said. Another official estimated the damage to the economy caused by the violence at around 1.7% of gross domestic product (GDP).
Mexican officials said they expected the case to take a long time to resolve, but were confident of success, noting that it was brought in the United States to ensure impartiality.
One Mexican official said the lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts because some of the companies were based there.
Mexican officials said the lawsuit was not aimed at the U.S. government, and Ebrard said he believed the Biden administration was willing to work with Mexico to stem arms trafficking.

Ebrard, viewed as a leading contender for Mexico's 2024 presidential elections, has repeatedly raised concerns about U.S. gun trafficking and lax gun controls.
The announcement of the lawsuit came a day after Ebrard traveled to El Paso, Texas, to commemorate the second anniversary of the killing of 22 people at a Walmart (NYSE:WMT), where the shooter was accused of deliberately targeting Mexicans.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 04:51PM ET</span>",Markets mixed as macro fears compete with earnings gold,"By Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON (Reuters) -Stocks, Treasuries and other major markets were mixed on Wednesday after July data showed that U.S. jobs growth slowed but demand for services increased, all as Federal Reserve officials signaled a likely pullback in market support.
After powering to a record high on Tuesday from strong earnings, the S&P 500 lost 20.46 points, or 0.46%, to close Wednesday at 4,402.69, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 323.34 points, or 0.92%, to 34,793.06. 
At the same time, the Nasdaq Composite added 19.24 points, or 0.13%, to 14,780.53, with big technology stocks such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) outperforming.
U.S. private payrolls increased far less than expected in July, likely constrained by shortages of workers and raw materials. Employers added 330,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday, compared with an increase of 695,000 forecast by economists polled by Reuters. 
""The market is surprisingly resilient given the weak ADP numbers and a bond market apparently signaling slower growth ahead,"" said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer of Nashville-based asset manager Laffer Tengler Investments.
Tengler pointed to the positive growth indicators from manufacturing inventories and demand for services, but cited concern over COVID-19 in China and related economic slowdowns.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday its non-manufacturing activity index hit 64.1 last month from 60.1 in June, the highest reading in its history.
Strong corporate profits have recently eased concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly 90% of the 377 S&P 500 Index companies that have reported earnings for the second quarter have come in above analyst expectations, the highest on record since 1994, according to Refinitiv data.
But investors are also weighing inflationary pressures and a growing belief that the Federal Reserve may soon trim support for the economy.
Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Wednesday that the U.S. economy is on track to meet the employment and inflation hurdles that the Federal Reserve has set for raising interest rates in 2023, echoing comments by other officials.
Traders sent U.S. Treasury yields slightly higher, apparently shifting their focus away from the disappointing payroll report.
Ten-year notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 1.1721%. They previously touched 1.127%, their lowest since February.
Investors are still waiting for the latest U.S. non-farm payroll numbers on Friday - the last before Federal Reserve leaders convene in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to discuss policy and decide future stimulus strategy.
""While the economic recovery has been exceptional by historical standards on account of massive fiscal and monetary policy, peak accommodation is likely behind us, and as a result, peak growth may be as well,"" BofA Global Research strategists wrote in a new report.
""Fiscal policy in the U.S. is likely to fall short of expectations and the exogenous risk of the Delta variant remains,"" the report added.
Oil prices fell for a third day in a row to a two-week low on Wednesday on a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles, the negative U.S. economic report and worries that the spread of the coronavirus Delta variant will weigh on global energy demand.
U.S. crude recently fell 3.73% to $67.93 per barrel and Brent was at $70.16, down 3.11% on the day.

The dollar recovered from a fall on Wednesday brought on by the jobs data. After a steady day, the dollar index against major currencies fell as much as 0.2% before turning back up. The dollar index was up around 0.26% as of late afternoon. 
Spot gold added 0.1% to $1,811.90 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.03% to $1,809.60 an ounce.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 04:41PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Biden plans shift in arms policy to add weight to human rights concerns,"By Mike Stone and Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is preparing an overhaul of arms export policy to increase the emphasis on human rights, a departure from former President Donald Trump's prioritization of economic benefits to U.S. defense contractors, four people familiar with the initiative said.
Defense companies and activists scrutinize such policies for insight into the administration's posture as it balances the commercial interests of exporters like  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) against the country's stated commitment to human rights.
Two State Department deputy assistant secretaries will brief congressional staff on Biden's draft Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy on Friday, said two of the people familiar with the situation, with a formal unveiling expected as soon as September.
The administration briefed a smaller group of congressional aides about two weeks ago, outlining a State Department desire for a ""more robust"" review of weapons sales with more input from the department's human rights bureau, an administration source and a congressional aide who participated said.
Details of the proposed shift have yet to be finalized and are being circulated to other, more export-friendly agencies like the Department of Defense, the people said. The Pentagon has traditionally advocated for putting weapons in the hands of allies so U.S. forces can rely on them more heavily in overseas conflicts. 
One congressional aide involved in briefings on the matter said he expected any policy change would have the most impact on sales of smaller weapons such as assault rifles and surveillance equipment, which can be used by police or paramilitary forces against domestic populations.
A senior administration official confirmed that the new CAT policy was being worked on and ""will help us build and maintain strategic partnerships that best reflect the values and interests of the United States.""
The new policy would also ""more robustly discuss"" connections between arms transfers and human rights, the official said.
The revamped policy could affect sales to countries like the Philippines, where human rights groups have called for investigation of police use of lethal force during raids.
Sales of major systems, such as air defense systems or naval systems, could be slowed although they likely would still go ahead.
""In some cases it will add an extra layer to getting to yes on a particular case,"" the congressional aide said.
PROGRESSIVE PRESSURE
Advocates of a stronger emphasis on human rights said the shift could affect sales to countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, especially given pressure from the progressive wing of Biden's Democratic Party over the toll on civilians of their raids in the civil war in Yemen.
""A new U.S. approach to arms sales is sorely needed. We must move beyond approaching arms sales as purely a transaction,"" said Rachel Stohl, vice president at the Stimson Center in Washington.  
""Overall, the Biden people seem to be in the same mode as the Trump people in promoting arms exports,"" the congressional aide said, noting that the tempo of weapons sales under the Biden administration is about the same as under Trump.
The United States is easily the world's biggest arms merchant, selling over $100 billion in weapons, services and training a year.
Trump, a Republican who favored weapons sales as a way to create U.S. jobs, rolled out in 2018 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-arms/trump-launches-effort-to-boost-u-s-weapons-sales-abroad-idUSKBN1HQ2E6 a new version of the CAT policy that gave commercial concerns as much weight as human rights in deciding whether to approve weapons sales.
U.S. weapons manufacturers backed Trump's strategy, which called for Cabinet secretaries to act as closers on major arms deals and sent top government officials to promote U.S. weapons at international air shows and arms bazaars.
Trump himself promoted arms deals in meetings and conversations with foreign leaders, including pressing the emir of Kuwait to move forward with a $10 billion fighter jet deal.

He controversially cast aside congressional review of major arms deals to push through a massive sale of smart bombs and other weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, despite concerns about the Yemen war and murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Trump said Riyadh was spending billions ""on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and many other great U.S. defense contractors"" and canceling the contracts would be ""foolish.""

762,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 04:31PM ET</span>",S&P 500 Falls as Weaker Jobs Data Spooks Investors,"By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Thursday on signs of weakness in the labor market market that spooked investors at a time when the Federal Reserve continues to signal that easy monetary policy measures will soon come to an end.   
The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.9%, or 323 points.
There appears more reason to be concerned in the labor market as private payrolls fell well short of expectations. ADP reported that private-sector employment rose by 330,000 in July, less than half the 690,000 rise expected.
The jobs front has come under added scrutiny in recently, as the Federal Reserve said the job gains still have a way to go to reach pre-pandemic levels, but will eventually hit the central bank's maximum employment target, paving the way for a lift off in rates. 
 “Given this outlook and so long as inflation expectations remain well anchored at the 2% longer-run goal … commencing policy normalization in 2023 would, under these conditions, be entirely consistent with our new flexible average inflation targeting framework,” Clarida told the Peterson Institute for International Economics in a virtual appearance, according to CNBC.
The weaker-than-expected jobs data came just days ahead of nonfarm payrolls data due Friday, and weighed on cyclical stocks including energy and industrials.
Energy was the worst performing sector, down more than 2% following a slip in oil prices as data showed weekly U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly increased last week.
Stockpiles increased 3.6 million barrels during the week ended July 30, confounding expectations for a draw of 3.1-million barrels.
A wave of mostly underwhelming quarterly results, meanwhile, added to pressure on stocks as Kraft Heinz and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) slumped.
Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC)reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, though sales slipped year-on-year. Its share price fell 5%.
General Motors reported mixed quarterly results as earnings missed, but revenue beat expectations. The automaker raised guidance that fell short of Wall Street estimates, sending its shares 9% lower.
The jump in cases brought on by the delta variant of coronavirus has also prompted some investor caution as some companies return toward implanting restrictions from last year.
“Some companies such as  Target  (NYSE:TGT) are adopting a mask mandate for employees, and others including  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and The Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) are implementing vaccine requirements. NYC, meanwhile, will now require proof of vaccination for entry into restaurants, gyms and leisure events, such as movie theaters,” Stifel said in a note.

The bank also projects that by 2040, almost every new car sold will be electric.
However, a current semiconductor shortage is far from being solved and is the primary factor dragging automobile production and sales down.

(Reuters) -A U.S. judge said  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s LinkedIn must face a lawsuit claiming it inflated the number of people who watched video ads on the networking platform, allowing it to overcharge hundreds of thousands of advertisers.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen, however, on Tuesday dismissed fraud-based claims and an unfair competition claim, saying the plaintiff advertisers did not show that LinkedIn made specific misrepresentations or that its conduct hurt the public at large.
But the San Jose, California-based judge let the advertisers pursue claims based on the theory that bot traffic, errant clicks and fraudulent clicks inflated the metrics they relied on when buying LinkedIn ads.
Led by TopDevz Inc and Noirefy Inc, the advertisers said LinkedIn had been counting video ad ""views"" from users' LinkedIn apps, even when the videos were playing only off-screen because users had scrolled past them.
LinkedIn said in an email on Wednesday it looked forward to showing the claims lacked merit and said it was ""committed to the transparency and integrity of our ads products.""
Warren Postman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email he was pleased with the decision and looked forward to proving that LinkedIn broke the law.
Van Keulen said the plaintiffs could try to pursue their dismissed claims again.
The advertisers sued after LinkedIn https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/linkedin-news/2020/how-we-re-working-to-improve said on Nov. 12 that its engineers had three months earlier found and then fixed software bugs that may have led to more than 418,000 overcharges. 
LinkedIn said more than 90% of the overcharges were less than $25, and that it provided credits to virtually all affected advertisers.

In their lawsuit, the advertisers said the overcharges left them with less money to spend elsewhere, including on ads. They are seeking unspecified damages and restitution.
The case is In re LinkedIn Advertising Metrics Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 20-08324.

Metlife reported adjusted earnings of $2.1 billion, or $2.37 per share, for the second quarter ended June 30, from $758 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.62 per share, according to data from Refinitiv IBES. 
The New York-based insurer said in May that the worst of the pandemic was behind it, as a rebound in investment income helped global life insurers offset some of the impact from payouts related to the health crisis.
Metlife reported a 29% jump in net investment income to $5.28 billion on strong returns from private-equity investments. 
Earlier in the day, Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU) also said the effect of COVID-19 on its group and individual life insurance appears to be lessening in the third quarter.
Adjusted earnings at Metlife's U.S. business jumped 72%, helping it offset a weak performance in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where its businesses were hurt by higher COVID-19-related claims.
Adjusted earnings in its U.S. group business took a $75 million hit from claims related to the health crisis, the insurer said. 
MetLife reported net derivatives of $421 million during the second quarter. 

The insurer holds a book of derivatives to hedge against market volatility. Such gains do not indicate the actual performance of the company, but reflect the effect of accounting rules, an issue that has occurred in some previous quarters.
Metlife also said its board had approved a new $3 billion share buyback plan.

Electronic Arts announced earnings per share of 71 cents on revenue of $1.34 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 62 cents on revenue of $1.28 billion.

773,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 03:56PM ET</span>",CVS hedges on 2022 earnings growth target as COVID-19 uncertainty persists,"(Reuters) -CVS Health Corp on Wednesday hedged a bit on its long-term target for double-digit earnings growth for next year, pointing to uncertainty around COVID-19 vaccination and testing demand, as well as medical costs, sending shares down 3%.
""Double-digit adjusted EPS growth remains the benchmark that we're always trying to achieve,"" said Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin. ""But an awful lot has changed since 2019 when that target was out there and stated."" 
CVS said it sees a slight rise in 2021 medical costs as it expects some uptick in COVID-19 vaccination and treatment costs and normalization of demand for non-pandemic healthcare services by the fourth quarter. 
Uncertainty caused by a recent surge in COVID-19 cases due to the more contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus led CVS to assume a higher estimate of COVID-related costs in the second half of the year, the company said.
CVS cut its 2021 expectations for the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses it would administer at its clinics to a range of 32 million to 36 million, from its prior view of 29 million to 44 million doses, reflecting a slowdown in vaccinations during the second quarter. 
CVS Chief Executive Karen Lynch said in an interview that the company has started seeing an increase in vaccinations, the majority of which are for first doses, as cases have increased due to the Delta variant.
Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc also said on Wednesday that vaccinations had picked up, mostly in Southern states. 
CVS CFO Guertin said that strength in sales of its pharmacy services and health insurance products, lower COVID-related costs and overall cost savings initiatives could help earnings in 2022. But the company will face pressure from pharmaceutical price increases, uncertain revenue from COVID-19 tests and vaccines and moving to a $15 minimum wage across the company, he said. 
CVS on Wednesday announced it will raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 effective July next year. 
The wage change, a potential U.S. corporate tax rate rise due to Biden administration policy initiatives and COVID-19 challenges could pose a threat to CVS' 2022 growth target, Morningstar analyst Julie Utterback said.

After beating Wall Street's second-quarter adjusted profit estimates by 36 cents, CVS increased its 2021 adjusted earnings forecast to $7.70 to $7.80 per share, from its prior view of $7.56 to $7.68.
Shares rose 3%, or $2.55, to $81.24.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department's internal watchdog has launched an audit into its $115 million contract with General Dynamics to build its new grant management software, which since its launch has been plagued by technological glitches and caused delays in funding criminal justice programs.
The audit by Inspector General Michael Horowitz was announced just a few weeks after Reuters first reported https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-47-billion-grant-programs-tech-woes-take-toll-justice-groups-2021-07-12 about the system's technology woes and Senator Charles Grassley, the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking Republican, called on Horowitz to launch an investigation. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/top-us-senator-demands-inquiry-into-justice-dept-grants-system-2021-07-21
In a tweet, Grassley welcomed the audit, saying grantees and taxpayers ""need accountability.""
The software program, known as ""JustGrants,"" manages the Justice Department's $4.7 billion portfolio of grants that fund everything from body-worn cameras for police to transitional housing for victims of domestic violence and human trafficking victims.
Built by General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) under a contract with a $115 million ceiling price, JustGrants was intended to consolidate the grants in one place and be compatible with a new government-wide payment system. To date, the Justice Department has spent about $70 million on it.
Reuters interviewed more than a dozen Justice Department employees and grant award winners who said the system has been plagued with severe technological problems which have made it hard to apply for grants or upload documents required in order to be permitted to draw down funds.
In some cases, award winners reported facing months of delays getting their funding.
In announcing the audit, Horowitz's office said it will review the department's transition to the JustGrants system, how it has administered its contract with General Dynamics and whether the company has complied with the contract terms and with federal rules.
A General Dynamics spokesman said the company was working closely with the department ""to deliver a modernized JustGrants system"" and the work was being completed ""in line with the implementation roadmap and schedule"" laid out by the Justice Department.

A Justice Department spokesman had no immediate comment.
The Justice Department has previously acknowledged the system has problems, but said it was unaware of cases in which grantees had not received their funding.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped Wednesday, as investors weighed up mixed economic data following evidence of a weaker labor market but stronger services activity just as the Federal Reserve looks to stick with plans to tightened monetary policy.
The S&P 500 fell 0.3%, the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.8%, or 293 points.
The ISM services index posted rebounded to a reading of 64.1 in July, above the previous peak of 64 set in May.
“The reopening of the service sector across the country continues to support strong readings in these diffusion indexes. The June decline created concern that the reopening had run into capacity constraints which would limit further upside. The July bounce puts those concerns at ease,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
In the labor market, however, there appears more reason to be concerned as private payrolls fell well short of expectations. This morning, ADP reported that private-sector employment rose by 330,000 in July, less than half the 690,000 rise expected.
The jobs front has come added scrutiny in recently, as the Federal Reserve said the job gains still have a way to go to reach pandemic levels.
“Given this outlook and so long as inflation expectations remain well anchored at the 2% longer-run goal … commencing policy normalization in 2023 would, under these conditions, be entirely consistent with our new flexible average inflation targeting framework,” Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said Wednesday told the Peterson Institute for International Economics in a virtual appearance, according to CNBC.
The weaker-than-expected jobs data came just days ahead of nonfarm payrolls data due Friday, and weighed on the cyclical stocks including energy and industrials.
Energy was the worst performing sector, down more than 2% following a slip in oil prices as data showed weekly U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly increased last week.
Stockpiles increased 3.6 million barrels during the week ended July 30, confounding expectations for a draw of 3.1-million barrels.
A wave of mostly underwhelming quarterly results, meanwhile, added to pressure on stocks as Kraft Heinz and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) slumped.
Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC)reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, though sales slipped year-on-year. Its share price fell 3%.General Motors reported mixed quarterly results as earnings missed, but revenue beat expectations. The automaker raised guidance that fell short of Wall Street estimates, sending its shares more than 5% lower.
The jump in cases brought on by the delta variant of coronavirus has also prompted some investor caution as some companies return toward implanting restrictions from last year.
“Some companies such as  Target  (NYSE:TGT) are adopting a mask mandate for employees, and others including  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and The Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) are implementing vaccine requirements. NYC, meanwhile, will now require proof of vaccination for entry into restaurants, gyms and leisure events, such as movie theaters,” Stifel said in a note.

Investing.com -- Stocks fell on Wednesday as Wall Street absorbed mixed data on the U.S. economic recovery, including worse than expected progress on jobs but improvement in services demand.
ADP’s private payrolls report showed employers added 330,000 jobs in July, far lower than the 695,000 expected. The government’s own nonfarm payrolls report is due out Friday.
The Institute for Supply Management reported its non-manufacturing activity index hit 64.1 last month from 60.1 in June, the highest reading in its history.
Contributing to the market sentiment on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida commented that the economy is on track to meet the employment and inflation goals the Federal Reserve has set for raising interest rates.
But the news was also filled with concerning stories about the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus. Cases and hospitalizations are spiking, especially in areas of the South and California where vaccination rates have been relatively low. 
In New York, the annual auto show was canceled for the second year, and organizers cited spiking cases of Covid. It was to have started August 20 at the Javits Center, a giant exhibition space that functioned as a vaccination megasite during the spring.

While the disease is still affecting the U.S. insurer, the impact is ""beginning to moderate,"" the New Jersey insurer's head of U.S. businesses Andrew Sullivan said on a conference call. 
The company noted that those with insurance were more likely to be vaccinated. ""We believe that the vaccination rate of the insured population is higher than the general population,"" Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Tanji said on call. 
The company said it expects after-tax adjusted operating income for the third quarter to fall to $2.59 a share from $3.79 a share in the second quarter, primarily due to timing of certain expenses and lower variable investment income. 
Prudential (NYSE:PUK)'s second-quarter after-tax adjusted operating income topped analysts' estimates by 68 cents a share, as strength in life and annuity businesses offset weakness in its investment unit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Organizers on Wednesday canceled the New York Auto Show that had been set for later this month amid rising COVID-19 cases caused by the more infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus amid rethinking of return to offices schedules.
The 10-day public show and press previews that had been set to start August 19 typically draw thousands of journalists from around the world and more than 1 million ticket buyers.
The show's return, which had been delayed from the originally planned April 2021, was announced in June with great fanfare by state and city officials as a sign of the state's ""significant progress in vaccinations and sustained reductions in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.""
Organizers said Wednesday the show had been ""canceled due to the growing incidences of the Covid-19 Delta variant and the increased measures announced recently by State and local officials to stop its spread.""
The show, which takes place at the Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, was last held in April 2019 and is typically used to unveil new vehicles by major automakers. Thousands of prospective car buyers use auto shows to help make purchase decisions.
The 2020 show was canceled at time when the Javits center was being used at the time as a make-shift hospital.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 02:32PM ET</span>","Group backed by Uber, Lyft pushes Massachusetts gig worker ballot measure","By Nate Raymond and Tina Bellon
BOSTON (Reuters) - A coalition of app-based companies, including Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc,  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and DoorDash Inc, on Wednesday took the first step to put a measure before Massachusetts voters that would define their drivers as independent contractors entitled to minimum benefits but avoid having them declared their employees.
If placed on the ballot next year, the proposal could make Massachusetts the epicenter for an expensive fight over the legal rights of gig workers, after a heated battle in California ended last year with voters cementing their contractor status.
The proposal is part of the gig industry's efforts to change labor law and enshrine their workers' status as independent contractors across the United States, with the potential for regulation by the Biden administration looming.
The Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work, whose members include Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart Inc, filed the proposal with the state's attorney general, who must certify whether the proposed question meets constitutional requirements.
That attorney general is Maura Healey, a Democrat who last year sued to challenge the designations by Uber and Lyft of their drivers as contractors not entitled to benefits like a minimum wage, overtime and earned sick time.
Should her office certify the question - a step that would come next month - backers could begin collecting the tens of thousands of signatures needed to get the issue on the November 2022 ballot.
Lyft President John Zimmer on Tuesday called the proposed ballot measure ""part of our continued efforts to advocate what the vast majority of drivers want: the flexible earning opportunities our platform provides plus new benefits.""
The proposal would establish an earnings floor equal to 120% of the Massachusetts minimum wage for app-based rideshare and delivery drivers, or $18 an hour in 2023 before tips. Drivers would be guaranteed at least $0.26 per mile to cover vehicle upkeep and gas.
Rideshare and delivery network companies would be required to pay healthcare stipends if drivers work at least 15 hours per week. Drivers could also earn paid sick time and paid family and medical leave. 
Opponents say the proposal amounts to a ploy by the companies to avoid paying taxes and contains loopholes that would create a subminimum wage for drivers.
""This is exploitation and Uber, Lyft and the gig economy's way of trying to create a sub-class of workers,"" Beth Griffith, an Uber driver and chair of the Boston Independent Drivers Guild, said on Tuesday ahead of the filing.
The Massachusetts proposal comes on the heels of a similar measure last year in California, where the companies convinced state voters to solidify ride-hail and food delivery workers' status as independent contractors with some benefits. 
Uber, DoorDash, Lyft, Instacart and Postmates jointly invested more than $205 million to lobby California voters to pass the measure, known as Proposition 22.

The companies in recent months have set up lobbying groups in at least five other states to push for laws that declare app-based ride-hail and food delivery drivers independent contractors. In some states the companies hope for buy-in from labor groups.
The companies are also facing the prospect of changes at the federal level. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, Boston's former mayor and an ex-labor union leader, recently said that ""in a lot of cases gig workers should be classified as employees.""

Rolls-Royce said there was no certainty an agreement will be reached. It issued a statement prompted by a report in a Spanish newspaper which said Bain and Spanish group Sener would pay 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion).
The British engine maker wants to sell 2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) worth of assets to help repair its balance sheet after the pandemic forced it to take on huge new debts. ITP is the biggest asset on the block. 
A price tag of 1.6 billion euros would beat the 1.5 billion euros at which reports have valued ITP, a turbine blade-maker, which will remain a supplier to Rolls-Royce after its sale.
Spanish newspaper Expansion reported news of the ITP sale on Wednesday, citing unidentified financial sources.
Should a deal materialise, it would be reassuring for shareholders keen to see the asset disposal programme, started almost a year ago, make progress after only minor sales to date.
""We do see risk that Rolls is running below its target in disposal proceeds, and we think this could become an increasing concern for investors,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts wrote in a recent note. 
Expansion said both the Spanish government and authorities in the Basque region, where ITP Aero is based, looked favourably on a sale to Bain and Sener. 
Sky News had previously reported that rival Spanish aerospace group Aciturri was planning its own bid, while financial buyers KKR and TowerBrook Capital had also been reported to be in the running. 
Bain declined to comment. Sener could not immediately be reached for comment.
Earlier on Wednesday, Rolls-Royce agreed to sell its smaller Norwegian unit Bergen to a new buyer five months after a deal with a Russian company was blocked by Norwegian authorities.

Meanwhile, other companies in this space have been able to capitalize on the industry tailwinds by quickly adapting to changing customer preferences for video gaming.

But as COVID-19 cases continue to soar and vaccinations increase,  Pfizer  (PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) are seeing a significant surge in demand for their vaccines. So, we think it could be wise to bet on these stocks. Read on.Amid rising COVID-19 cases due to the virus’ highly contagious Delta variant, the government has been urging citizens to get vaccinated. In addition, because the seven-day average of COVID cases has surpassed the peak seen last summer, some states and local administrations are offering incentives to encourage people to get vaccinated pronto.
According to reports, most unvaccinated people have lately been contracting severe COVID-19 infections. Due to the concerns surrounding the new strain, the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the U.S. has risen by 26% versus three weeks ago. As such, COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers are all set to cash in on the opportunity with inoculation kicking into high gear in the coming months.
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), which are among the few major companies currently offering COVID-19 vaccines, are expected to deliver excellent returns this year and beyond as demand for vaccines continues to soar.

Investing.com – Stocks of BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) soared Wednesday as the World Health Organization asked countries, particularly the wealthy ones, to stop the distribution of Covid-19 booster shots for at least two months.
BioNTech was up 16% and Moderna 8%.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which is collaborating with Germany-based BioNTech on the Covid vaccine, was flat. So was Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
The world health body cited vaccine inequity for its request.
“We need an urgent reversal from the majority of vaccines going to high-income countries, to the majority going to low income countries,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press briefing.
WHO’s plea comes as the Delta variant, which wreaked havoc in India during March-May, spreads in the U.S., Vietnam, Australia and several other countries of the world.
Vaccine manufacturing is happening in very few countries like the U.S., Russia, China, India and parts of Europe and capacities are constrained. Supply chains are stretched with the mRNA vaccines, found to be the most effective in neutralizing the virus, needing special infrastructure for their transportation and administration.
While vaccine makers will be happy to see a higher demand for vaccines, not everyone is convinced a booster is needed nor is there a certainty on which vaccines need more than two doses. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is the only one that needs only one regular dose.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the data warranting the need for booster doses remains unclear.
A study in Israel recently pointed out to decreasing efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine even as it said the shot prevents serious illness.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's top bank Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) raised its full-year profit estimate after stronger-than-forecast second-quarter earnings, and said it planned to return 3.3 billion euros ($3.9 billion) to shareholders later this year.
Intesa, which last year secured a fifth of Italy's banking market by taking over rival UBI, has along with other lenders across Europe reported shrinking charges against loan losses and rebounding net fees as the coronavirus crisis eases.
With COVID-related payout curbs due to end on Sept. 30, Intesa said it would distribute cash reserves of 1.9 billion euros from 2020 results, after paying 694 million euros in dividends in May. 
The bank, which has committed to a strong payout policy, also plans, for the first time, to pay an interim dividend of 1.4 billion euros in November on 2021 earnings, subject to discussions with regulators.
Analysts calculated that the fourth quarter's earnings distribution, among ""the highest in the sector"" according to Citi, implies a yield of more than 7%.
NEW BUSINESS PLAN
Intesa revised its full-year profit guidance to at least 4 billion euros from well above 3.5 billion euros.
CEO Carlo Messina said Intesa was working to accelerate profit growth under a new business plan due in February, with a ""minimum"" 5 billion euro net income goal for 2022.
In the three months through June net profit stood at 1.5 billion euros, above a 903 million euro average analyst forecast.
The bank booked a 460 million euro one-off gain in the quarter linked to a fiscal effect on intangible assets.
Messina told analysts part of that money was used to provision against losses on specific impaired loans, and that the bank could speed up bad loan disposals during the rest of the year.
Total revenue of 5.2 billion euros in the period beat a Reuters consensus estimate of 4.94 billion euros, up from a year earlier though below the first-quarter due to a boost from trading at the start of the year.
""Overall, sound numbers, with no obvious area of concern, and with earnings risks leaning to the upside,"" UBS analysts said.
Net fees rose 18% from the second quarter of 2020, the worst affected by Italy's coronavirus crisis.
Funds borrowed at negative rates from the European Central Bank drove the net interest margin, or income from banks' core lending business, higher in the period versus the previous three months after five consecutive quarters of decline.
Messina said the interest margin would improve further in the second half, adding credit demand was beginning to pick up as companies looked to resume investing.

Loan writedowns stood at 599 million euros, less than half the year ago figure, with gross impaired loans falling to 4.1% of total lending from 4.4% at the end of March.

(Reuters) -Kraft Heinz Co on Wednesday warned of margin pressure from higher prices of ingredients, sending its shares down 4%, even as the packaged food maker forecast annual core earnings to top pre-pandemic levels. 
Companies across sectors have been plagued by a double whammy of higher raw material costs, and increased spending on shipments aimed at easing the strain on their supply chains due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
To add to packaged food makers' woes, analysts have said they would be forced to offer higher discounts and spend more on marketing to sustain high sales levels.
Kraft, however, has announced price increases across its portfolio to counter the impact of higher expenses, while noting that inflation was ""manageable."" 
The company forecast annual inflation to be above the midpoint of a mid-single-digit range compared with the prior estimate of it being at the lower end of the range. 
Kraft also cautioned it was too early to gauge how demand would stabilize between at-home and away-from-home channels amid the pandemic-related uncertainty that has forced companies across sectors to flag supply chain and demand-related concerns. 
The Jell-O maker projects annual adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), including the impact of divestitures of cheese and nuts businesses, to be above the $6.1 billion it recorded in 2019.
J.P. Morgan's Ken Goldman wrote ""it still potentially stands below consensus."" 

Kraft, known for brands such as Philadelphia cream cheese and Heinz ketchup, beat estimates for the reported quarter after demand for snacks and packaged meals remained strong even as people started venturing out following the easing of coronavirus restrictions.
Net sales were $6.62 billion in the second quarter, topping estimates of $6.55 billion. Adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share was also above Refinitiv IBES estimates of 72 cents.

(Reuters) -Boeing Co scrubbed the launch of its CST-100 Starliner to the International Space Station on Tuesday due to a system glitch, a fresh setback for the U.S. aerospace company following the vehicle's botched 2019 debut. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) engineers ruled out ""a number of potential causes, including software,"" but were still working to understand the source of ""unexpected valve position indications"" in the propulsion system, Boeing said in a statement Tuesday evening. 
""Additional time is needed to complete the assessment,"" Boeing said, adding that it would also not proceed with the next potential launch window on Wednesday.
The delay of Tuesday's uncrewed test flight throws into question the timing of Boeing's follow-on mission with a crew onboard, which Boeing has said would take place no earlier than December. 
Boeing engineers detected the valve position problem during Tuesday's pre-launch preparations, while making checks after electrical storms in the region, Boeing said in a statement.
""We're going to let the data lead our work,"" said John Vollmer, the program's manager. ""We will not launch until our vehicle is performing nominally and our teams are confident it is ready to fly."" 
The Starliner capsule loaded with supplies had been due to blast off atop an Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) V rocket flown by the United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. 
The launch was originally planned for last Friday, but was postponed by NASA after the space station was briefly thrown out of control with seven crew members aboard, a mishap caused by the inadvertent reignition of jet thrusters on a newly docked Russian service module. Russia's space agency blamed a software glitch.
The uncrewed mission was intended as a precursor to crewed flight potentially to be conducted before the end of the year. It was the latest setback for a U.S. aerospace giant reeling from back-to-back crises - a pandemic that crushed demand for new jetliners and a safety scandal caused by two fatal 737 MAX crashes - that have damaged Boeing's finances and engineering reputation. 
Boeing was powering down the spacecraft on Tuesday evening, and planned to roll the rocket and spacecraft back to the Vertical Integration Facility on Wednesday for further inspection and testing ""to inform the next steps,"" Boeing said.
The Starliner capsule headlined Boeing's efforts against billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX to be the first to return NASA astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. 
But a series of software glitches during the December 2019 debut launch resulted in its failure to dock at the orbital laboratory outpost. SpaceX's Crew Dragon has gone on to launch three crewed space station missions since 2020, with a fourth scheduled as early as Oct. 31, according to NASA.
Boeing has spent a year and a half correcting issues flagged during NASA reviews, part of the U.S. space agency's strategy to ensure access to the sprawling international research satellite some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.

NASA in 2014 awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build their own capsules that could fly American astronauts to the space station in an effort to wean the United States off its dependence on Russia's Soyuz vehicles for rides to space following the end of NASA's space shuttle program in 2011. 
The capsule had been loaded for the 24-hour trip to the station with a flight test dummy nicknamed ""Rosie the Rocketeer,"" and about 760 pounds of cargo, Boeing said.

Everson spent more than a decade at Facebook before stepping down as its advertising head in June. She was a key spokesperson for the company last summer when more than 1,000 advertisers boycotted the social media giant over concerns it was not doing enough to combat hate speech. 
In her new role, Everson will be tasked with bringing in new advertisers on Instacart's app as the nine-year-old startup looks to broaden its business beyond delivering groceries. 
With Everson's appointment, Instacart said women now accounted for more than half its executive leadership.
""I think we have a leadership team now fully in place that can scale the company and take it public,"" Chief Executive Officer Fidji Simo told Reuters, adding that she does not expect to make a lot more big hires. 

Simo, a former Facebook executive, joined Instacart earlier this month while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Nick Giovanni joined the grocery startup as its finance chief in January. 
Reuters reported in March that Instacart was considering going public through a direct listing, just a few days after a funding round valued the company at $39 billion.

Investing.com –  Lyft  stock (NASDAQ:LYFT) tumbled 9% as the company’s warning of driver shortages and the surging Delta variant combined to make traders nervous about the ride-haling app’s earnings in the ongoing quarter.
Companies everywhere are finding it hard to hire suitable workers as world economies have boomed after a year of the pandemic.
Company executives said revenue per ride is expected to decrease on a sequential basis.
The company said payouts for driver incentives and a decrease in prices for riders would keep third-quarter revenue under pressure.
Still, Lyft recorded adjusted profitability for the first time.
According to Reuters, late-night and weekend trips, as well as rides to airports, had significantly increased for Lyft drivers during the second quarter, in a sign of the company's most profitable rides returning.
Overall, ridership grew by more than 3.6 million from the March quarter, to more than 17 million riders during April-June. This happened as most cities in the U.S. lifted restrictions and more Americans returned to the road after a year of the pandemic.
Revenue more than doubled to $765 million versus $339.3 million, an increase of 125% year-over-year. Adjusted net loss sharply narrowed to $18 million compared to a net loss of $265.8 million in the second quarter of 2020.

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co’s pickup trucks are hauling in cash through the global semiconductor shortage and a resurgent pandemic, but investors on Wednesday signaled they want more from Chief Executive Mary Barra.
Shares in the No. 1 U.S. automaker fell 7.8%. 
The harsh reaction to GM's numbers - and to strong results earlier Wednesday from  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Honda Motor Co - underscore the uncertainty facing global automakers in a time of technological and economic disruption. 
Barra, in a call on Wednesday, said GM will ""continue to see the impact this year"" of the chip shortage, and expects it will continue into the new year.
But she said trucks, SUVs and crossovers will help buttress results in the second half and beyond, adding, ""We're going to see a strong pricing environment continue throughout the rest of the year and into 2022.""
GM reported second quarter net income of $2.8 billion, or $1.90 a share, compared with a loss in the year-earlier quarter of $806 million, or 56 cents a share. The latest results included an $800 million cost for a second recall of Chevrolet Bolt electric cars.
Excluding items, GM earned $1.97 a share. But analysts were expecting $2.23 a share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
And analysts said GM's full-year profit guidance was conservative. GM raised its full-year forecast for pre-tax profits to $11.5 billion-$13.5 billion, from the previous $10 billion to $11 billion. 
Rival Stellantis NV earlier this week boosted its target for full-year operating profit margins to about 10% from an earlier forecast of 5.5%-7.5%.
As GM's latest results demonstrated, the company's near-term profits depend heavily on selling high-margin, combustion-engine pickup trucks and big sport utility vehicles in North America. GM's U.S. electric vehicle sales were about 1.6% of U.S. deliveries in the second quarter.
But GM's truck franchise market faces threats from Washington, where the Biden administration is expected as early as this week to propose tougher vehicle emissions limits and an accelerated shift to electric vehicles.
The grinding pandemic also continues to threaten GM's profit machine, directly and indirectly. The company expects to lose production of about 100,000 vehicles in North America in the second half, and anticipates commodity costs rising by $1.5 billion-$2.0 billion.
The spreading Delta variant poses a threat to the company's workers. GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis NV, along with the United Auto Workers, on Tuesday reinstated mandatory mask wearing in their U.S. factories, and called on workers to get vaccinated. 
GM has not followed other large U.S. employers in mandating workers get COVID vaccinations. But Barra did not rule out further steps to combat the Delta variant. ""We are evaluating what is appropriate and talking to different stakeholders,"" Barra said. ""We are evaluating multiple choices we can make.""
A 'MUCH LEANER' GM
The supply chain crunch and the pandemic have forced GM to learn how to sustain sales and profits with far less inventory at U.S. dealers than in the past.
Going forward, Barra said, ""we will be much leaner and efficient.""
GM's inventories of unsold vehicles as of June 30 were half the year ago levels. It said it had $1.4 billion worth of vehicles in inventory that had been built without certain electronics modules because of the lack of semiconductors. 
GM said its more bullish full-year outlook depended on having no vehicles stuck in inventory because of a lack of semiconductors. As of June 30, GM said it had $1.4 billion worth of incomplete vehicles in inventory.
The company reiterated its plan to introduce more than 30 electric vehicles by 2025, including two new EVs that will be aimed at commercial and small-business customers.
However, the second quarter results illustrated the risks of new technology. The money set aside to pay for recalling Bolts to deal with a risk the batteries could catch fire cost an average $11,600 per car.
GM said its previously announced investment of $35 billion between 2020 and 2025 is primarily to increase manufacturing capacity for EVs and batteries. The company said it will add EV production capacity by converting existing combustion-engine vehicle assembly plants.

Barra said she hopes the Biden administration and Congress will deliver more federal money to build electric vehicle charging stations, tax credits for investments in U.S. electric vehicle plants and expanded tax breaks for customers buying both new and used electric cars - all moves that would benefit GM.
GM said adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were a record $4.1 billion, and $8.5 billion in the first half.

(Reuters) -U.S. oil refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) said it expects to process slightly less crude in the third quarter compared with the second, as the summer driving season comes to an end and the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus threatens fuel demand recovery. 
While refiners ramped up crude processing in the second quarter as U.S. gasoline and diesel fuel demand nearly recovered to pre-pandemic levels, the Delta variant could still sap travel demand, cutting consumption of refined products.
""As we head into the second half of the year, we remain hopeful but cautious in the recovery,"" Chief Executive Officer Michael Hennigan said. 
""The reason we're still cautious, however, is the delta variant is spiking up in a lot of areas...We're going to have to see how the COVID plays itself out into the second half of the year and as we approach another winter season.""
Shares of the company were down 2.1% at $54.76, amid a broader drop in oil prices.
Marathon Petroleum forecast current-quarter throughput, the amount of crude processed, of 2.8 million barrels per day, compared with 2.9 million bpd in the second quarter ended June 30. 
Gasoline demand was currently 2% to 5% below 2019 levels, while jet fuel demand was down nearly 30% below pre-pandemic levels, Hennigan said. 
Marathon's adjusted second-quarter earnings of 67 cents per share was its first since the pandemic, also beating analysts' estimate of 39 cents, as more vaccinations and lower travel restrictions boosted demand for refined products. 

Refining and marketing margins rose 23% to $12.45 per barrel in the second quarter, while crude capacity utilization rose to 94% from 83% in the first. 
Rival Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), which also posted its first adjusted quarterly profit in more than a year, said on Tuesday market conditions in the third quarter would determine refinery utilization levels.

However, we think the company’s continuing cost pressures and uncertain growth prospects could keep its business recovery earthbound for a while yet. So, let’s discuss.Leading low-cost carrier Long Island City, N.Y.-based JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) offers air passenger transportation services across the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America. As consumer confidence and travel demand return gradually from their pandemic-induced lows, JBLU’s second-quarter revenue improved significantly from the first quarter of 2021. But the company reduced its capacity by 15% in its last reported quarter.
Although improving travel demand amid widespread COVID-19 vaccinations has helped JBLU gain 46.2% over the past year, the stock is down 13.6% over the past month. In addition, the stock is trading 32.7% below its 52-week high of $21.96, which it hit on June 4. Also, JBLU is currently trading lower than its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $17.21 and $16.91, respectively, which indicates a downtrend.

(Reuters) -Apollo Global Management Inc said on Wednesday its second-quarter distributable earnings more than doubled thanks to a surge in profits from asset sales in its private equity business and transaction fees from its credit division.
The result, which beat estimates, was the first full quarter reported by Apollo with its co-founder Marc Rowan serving as chief executive officer. He replaced Leon Black, who relinquished control of the firm in March following a review of his ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Apollo's other co-founder, Josh Harris, announced in May that he would leave Apollo by early next year. He has now been removed as a ""keyman"" in Apollo's flagship private equity fund, Rowan said during an analyst earnings call. A keyman in a private equity fund is a fund manager whose absence can lead to the suspension of a fund's investment period. 
Apollo's shares were down 1.2% in early afternoon trading in New York at $59.91.
New York-based Apollo's distributable earnings, which represent the cash for paying dividends to shareholders, rose to $501.6 million from $205.2 million posted a year ago.
That resulted in distributable earnings per share of $1.14, ahead of a Refinitiv consensus estimate of 71 cents.
Apollo said it invested $27.8 billion during the quarter, mostly in its credit and private equity portfolios. It also cashed out investments worth $9 billion, mainly in its holdings of public and private companies. The firm collected about $55 million in transaction fees from its credit unit, which encompasses its Athene franchise.
Rivals Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc,  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc have also reported strong second-quarter results, as buoyant public markets and a rebound in economic growth allowed private equity firms to sell investments.
Apollo said its private equity funds appreciated by 9.5% during the quarter, while its corporate credit and structured credit funds rose 2% and 4.5% respectively. By comparison, private equity funds managed by Blackstone, Carlyle and KKR grew 12%, 13.8% and 9% respectively.

Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Apollo reported a net income of $648.6 million, up 48% from a year ago driven by a rise in gains from investment activities.

(Reuters) - European shares ended at fresh highs on Wednesday with technology stocks hitting a 20-year peak, while optimism over the second-quarter earnings season continued to feed into positive sentiment. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.6% to a record high of 468.22 points, extending its record-setting run to a third day. 
Technology stocks were the best performers for the day, surging 1.9% to levels last seen during the dot-com bubble.
Recent buying into the sector has been driven by a rise in cases of the Delta coronavirus variant in Europe, given technology's resilience to disruptions caused by the virus. 
Strong second-quarter earnings also pointed towards improving economic conditions, as COVID-19 vaccinations picked up pace across the continent.
Analysts now expect STOXX 600 companies to post a record 139.6% jump in second-quarter profits versus a year ago, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
Dutch chemicals firm IMCD and satellite maker SES were the top performers on the STOXX 600, rising 10.5% and 9.9%, respectively, on strong results.
Coffee company JDE Peet's jumped 2.4% after reporting a better-than-expected operating profit for the first half of 2021.
""Earnings are coming out really strong and that is giving equity investors some comfort,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard.
""The other thing that could give investors a rush of bullishness could be the fact that, if you look at the UK, new cases of COVID-19 are falling quite sharply. That gives you a hope that the same should happen in rest of Europe as well.""

A survey showed euro zone business activity raced ahead in July, expanding at its fastest pace in 15 years, as the lifting of more restrictions and an accelerated vaccine drive injected life into the bloc's dominant service industry.
However, supply chain disruptions and labour shortages meant input prices surged at the fastest rate in more than two decades.
Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) fell 5.8% and was among the worst performers on the STOXX 600, after it swung to a second-quarter loss following a write-off to end an outsourcing project and as the lender undergoes a major restructuring.

Siemens Energy rose more than 2% as it cranked up the pressure on its Spanish-listed wind turbine division Siemens Gamesa after it was forced to slash its profit outlook because of the unit.
Swiss drugmaker Roche inched up 0.4% after Bloomberg reported that SoftBank had built a $5 billion stake in the company.

(Reuters) -Shares of Entain, which rejected a takeover offer from MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) this year, jumped to a record high on Wednesday after a $4.4 billion asset sale by the U.S. casino group prompted bets of a renewed bid for the British bookmaker.
Entain, which owns the  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and Coral brands, knocked back a $11 billion offer from MGM in January as too low. But some investors expect that MGM's sale of its stake in MGM Growth Properties (NYSE:MGP) will give it fresh cash that could spur MGM to make another bid for Entain, analysts said.
""Investors have been debating the likelihood of MGM returning with an improved bid for ENT since its first unsuccessful bid,"" Davy analyst Michael Mitchell said via email. 
""The market believes (MGM's) strengthened balance sheet, following today's news, has increased the possibility of the same.""
MGM said in its announcement on Wednesday that the stake sale would give it ""$11.6 billion of domestic operations liquidity available to enable execution of its goals of becoming the premier gaming entertainment company"". 
American gambling firms had been tapping into the expertise of British rivals in the past year as sports betting has taken off in the United States during the coronavirus crisis and following a landmark ruling in 2018, which legalised such bets. 
William Hill was taken over by Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment while Gamesys agreed in March to a possible takeover by Bally's Corp.
When it dropped plans to bid for Entain in January, MGM said it would not submit a revised offer. Under UK takeover rules, the U.S. firm was precluded from bidding for Entain for six months after walking away. The six-month window expired on July 19.
Entain, previously known as GVC, and MGM declined to comment. 

The companies continue to collaborate on their 50/50 BetMGM joint venture in the United States.
Entain's shares rose 8% to an all-time peak and were the top gainer on the FTSE 100 index, while other British gambling companies Flutter and 888 Holdings also rose between 3% and 5% after MGM's announcement.

Investing.com – Kraft stock (NASDAQ:KHC) fell 4% Wednesday as the company warned of pricier ingredients and other raw materials hurting its margins.  
At the same time, the maker of Philadelphia cream cheese and Heinz ketchup said it is “effectively managing inflationary pressures."" The company is undertaking price hikes on its products to offset pressure on margins.
Traders ignored the company’s forecast of annual core earnings topping even the pre-pandemic levels.
For the ongoing quarter, Kraft expects a mid-single-digit percentage increase in organic net sales and a low-single-digit percentage decline in constant currency adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization compared to the third quarter of 2019.
The company’s second-quarter net sales and profits were both higher than expectations but lower than last year’s comparable figures.
Net sales fell 0.5% to $6.61 billion as at-home consumption moderated with people stepping out after a year of pandemic. Same time last year, people stayed home and stocked up on all groceries.
The company shutting down its nuts business in the second quarter also hurt sales. Otherwise, net sales were even higher than 2019-levels.
Adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis fell to 78 cents from 80 cents of last year’s quarter."

(Reuters) -Royal Caribbean Group on Wednesday flagged a modest hit to its bookings from the Delta variant of the coronavirus and leaned on vaccines for safe voyages as the cruise industry takes to the sea after a pandemic-led standstill.
Shares fell about 2.4% after the company, which operates the biggest cruise ships in the world, reported a bigger quarterly loss than expected. 
Cruise operators resumed sailing from U.S. ports in June with mostly vaccinated passengers and crew on limited capacity following lengthy talks with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about health and safety protocols.
The resumption came more than a year after operations were suspended, but a few on-board cases in recent weeks and rising infections in U.S. states have raised worries that a rebound for the cruise industry could be delayed.
""The vaccines are the ultimate weapon,""  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Chief Executive Richard Fain said on a call with analysts.
""It's impossible to eliminate cases on board a ship totally. But the steps that we are taking are designed to prevent the isolated cases from becoming an outbreak and it seems to be working.""
Royal Caribbean requires passengers above 12 years of age to be fully vaccinated, except for cruises departing from Florida, due to the state's ban on businesses asking for so-called ""vaccine passports"". 
Florida is crucial for cruise companies as it has the main ports of departure for Caribbean voyages.
Still, Royal Caribbean said bookings for 2022 cruises were ""practically back"" to pre-pandemic levels due to the pent-up demand for vacations. 

It expects 80% of its capacity to be in service by 2021 end and turn cash-flow positive in about six months.
The company reported a second-quarter adjusted net loss of $1.3 billion, or $5.06 per share, bigger than $4.39 loss estimated by analysts, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

(Reuters) -The New York Times Co beat quarterly profit expectations on Wednesday as its advertising business showed signs of recovery, eclipsing slower growth in digital subscriptions and sending its shares 12% higher.
The financial fallout from the COVID-19 crisis had last year cut deeply into the publication's advertising revenue. But with companies raising their marketing budgets after the reopening of the economy, The Times posted a 66% surge in ad sales. 
Most of that came from large technology and financial services businesses, which spent heavily on the company's targeted advertising products, Chief Financial Officer Roland Caputo said.
The publication expects advertising revenue to rise by 30% to 35% in the current quarter.
It posted an adjusted profit of 36 cents per share in the second quarter on revenue of $498.5 million. Analysts had expected a profit of 27 cents per share on revenue of $487.7 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER GROWTH SLOWS
The Times' digital subscriber growth, however, slumped to its lowest in three years, as interest in domestic COVID-19 news waned after vaccinations.
The 170-year-old publication added only 142,000 digital subscribers in the quarter ended June, its lowest since the second quarter of 2018.
Downloads of the company's app fell by two-thirds year-over-year between May and June, according to Sensortower data.
Still, coverage of the devastating events in South Florida, the political crisis in Haiti and the still surging pandemic in other parts of the world helped attract readers, Chief Executive Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Kopit Levien said.

At the end of the quarter, the Times had nearly 8 million total subscriptions, of which 7.1 million were digital-only.
Shares in the company jumped by the most in more than a year and a half to $48.75.

The move comes at a time when employers in the United States are introducing benefits and raising wages as they struggle to find and keep enough workers, particularly in retail and restaurants.
Target's rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said last month it would pay the full cost of college tuition and books for its roughly 1.5 million full and part-time employees, effective Aug. 16.
Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Target also said its frontline workers at stores, distribution centers and headquarters could choose from 250 business programs at over 40 institutions, including University of Arizona and Oregon State University.

For workers pursuing courses outside the select degrees in the program it has built with upskilling platform Guild Education, Target will provide direct payments of up to $5,250 for non-master's degrees to academic institutions and up to $10,000 for master's degrees each year.

Investing.com – CVS stock (NYSE:CVS) fell nearly 1% in Wednesday’s premarket the company’s decision to raise minimum wages to $15 an hour next year onwards outweighed the company’s forecast for a better 2021.
That the boost from Covid vaccinations that lifted the company’s second-quarter earnings may be over also weighed on the sentiment.
Companies, and particularly retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and CVS, who need a large workforce to run their operations, have been hard pressed to find labor in a booming economy. Firms have thus had to resort to wage hikes.
The company now expects 2021 revenue to come between $280.7 billion and $285.2 billion compared to the $279.2 billion to $283.7 billion range it gave earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis is seen between $7.70 and $7.80.
The company said the improved outlook is due to the outperformance in the second quarter and that it expects gains from Covid vaccinations to moderate in the second half.
CVS’ revenue from its health-insurance business rose 11% but adjusted operating income more than halved to $1.61 billion as the company had to pay out more in claims from patients who attended to the medical issues they had delayed so far because of the pandemic.
The medical-benefit ratio—the proportion of premiums paid out in claims—rose to 84% from 70%.
Total revenue rose 11% to $72.6 billion as the company administered more than 6 million Covid-19 tests and nearly 17 million Covid-19 vaccines in the second quarter. Revenue surpassed the analysts’ expectation of $70.14 billion.
EPS at $2.42 also beat the estimated $2.06.

LONDON (Reuters) -HSBC has increased pay for first-year analysts in its United States investment banking business to $100,000 from $85,000, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, following similar moves by Wall Street rivals in recent weeks.
The decision, first reported by London-based Financial News, was taken several weeks ago but was communicated to staff this week, the source said, and pay rises for those further up the junior ranks were awarded in May.
HSBC earlier this week topped up its bonus pool by $900 million after reporting more than doubled profits, as it released cash set aside to cover bad loans from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The pay rise comes amid a growing battle to attract junior staff in the banking industry, particularly in the United States, as some talented young people are put off by the long hours associated with investment banking and lured instead by sheen of big tech companies or private equity firms.
That has sparked industry-wide pay increases to try to compete, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) boosting first-year pay to $110,000 according to media reports this week, after rivals such as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) made similar moves.

Goldman could not immediately be reached for comment.

Because the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread at an alarming pace, COVID-19 vaccine stocks are again coming into focus with investors. According to CDC data, 70% of adults in the U.S. have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. However, with the spread of the Delta variant, the United States could see 140,000 new cases per day by the end of this month.

The iPhone maker has warned of supply shortages as the U.S.-China trade tensions and the coronavirus pandemic have intensified pressure on global supply chains.
Beijing is also strengthening efforts to create world-leading local tech firms, with apparently government-supported Chinese firms working to manufacture products for global firms including Apple.
According to the Nikkei report, China's Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd is set to build up to 3% of the iPhone 13 series, Lens Tech Co Ltd will supply metal casings and Sunny Optical Tech Group Co Ltd will supply rear camera lenses. BOE Tech Group Co Ltd will also supply components.
Apple boss Tim Cook in July said there were ""some shortages"" and that it was difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times.
""The company is pulling all the levers it can, from a global supply-chain standpoint (including China) to minimize the disruption to its sales,"" said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co. 
""Tim Cook is part CEO and part diplomat... Cook has proven capable at enabling Apple to continue to leverage China from a supply-chain standpoint and generate a lot of revenue from selling products to Chinese consumers."" 
Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Taiwan-based Foxconn has set up a task force to fend off the growing clout of Chinese electronics manufacturer Luxshare to look into whether the company is supported by any Chinese government entity, Reuters reported last year.
Luxshare won orders over Foxconn and Pegatron Corp, and will start building the iPhone 13 Pro this month, the paper said.

By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Hippo Holdings Inc wants to change homeowners' insurance by using customer data to make it faster and easier to get coverage, Hippo's chief executive said in an interview.
The company, which has a $5 billion valuation and went public through a blank-check company on Tuesday, is among a slew of ""insurtech"" listings that are trying to pry business from established insurers.
""I want to double down on tech, data and more engineering and more capabilities,"" CEO Assaf Wand said of the $638 million Hippo will receive in proceeds from the listing.
Hippo's sales aspirations mirror companies like Geico Corp and Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR), which have made the auto insurance market more competitive.
To get there, Hippo plans to develop algorithms that speed up policy quotes and create new products, Wand said.
Hippo is backed by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus. Founded in 2015, it also offers coverage for renters and has products for other homeowner headaches that insurers traditionally do not cover, such as upkeep, security, repairs and eventually selling the place. 
For example, Hippo provides sensors that chirp when water leaks under a kitchen sink, so a plumber can be called to prevent serious damage. That helps the homeowner, but also reduces the amount Hippo would have to pay out in claims. Similarly, outside motion detectors can help prevent burglaries.
Hippo went public through Reinvent Technology Partners, its special purpose acquisition company, and started trading on Tuesday.
In mid-morning trading on Tuesday, Hippo shares were up 2.4% at $10.025, according to the New York Stock Exchange.
Hippo's total written premiums grew from $142 million in 2018 to $405 million in 2020, the company said. It forecasts $544 million this year and $2.28 billion by 2025.
""Hippo's grown extraordinarily fast,"" said Tom Mason, senior analyst at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence. ""The real estate market is so hot, that's a big part of their growth.""
Other recently listed insurtechs like Lemonade Inc and Porch Group Inc have gone up since their listings. 
But there are risks from a housing market down-shift, Mason said. And insurtechs broadly need to show steady profitability to win over investors, said Robert Le, analyst at PitchBook.

""High-growth insurtech companies with high loss ratios are risky,"" Le said. 
Hippo bought property and casualty insurer Spinnaker Insurance Co last year, gaining licenses in all 50 U.S. states. It currently sells in 37 states, reaching about 80% of U.S. homeowners and expects to expand to 90% this year. Among large population states, it offers coverage in California but not in New York.

Investing.com – General Motors stock (NYSE:GM) fell over 7% Wednesday as the carmaker warned of semiconductor shortages, higher raw material prices and supply chain challenges even as it raised its forecast for the year.
The company lost market share in almost all segments and all geographies barring one and that weighed on the stock too. However, its share of the U.S. market for trucks rose to 31.2% from 30% a year ago.
It called the semiconductor shortage situation “fluid” and said it will look to prioritize products that have the highest-demand and are capacity-constrained.
The company expects to lose production of about 100,000 vehicles in North America in the second half while it anticipates commodity costs to rise by $1.5 billion-$2.0 billion, according to Reuters.
GM is not alone in suffering from semiconductor shortage. It has troubled almost all carmakers last one year as the pandemic-induced lockdowns in various parts of the world disrupted supply chains. Factories have been shut and production curtailed.
Prices of steel, rubber, glass and almost all inputs have risen. Shipping too has suffered.   
Nonetheless, the company now expects full-year EBIT-adjusted in the range of $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion, compared to $10 billion-$11 billion previously.
According to Reuters, the more bullish outlook depends on GM having no vehicles stuck in inventory because of a lack of semiconductors.
Net income in the second quarter was $2.8 billion, or $1.90 a share, compared with a loss of $806 million, or 56 cents a share in the same period a year ago.

Vaccine administration rose more than 30% in states such as Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky and Texas in the past few weeks, the company said.
Cases of COVID-19, along with hospitalizations and deaths from it, increased in the U.S. last week, even as the pace of vaccinations increase amid concerns over the highly contagious Delta variant.
One in three cases nationwide occurred in Florida and Texas in the past week, health officials said on Monday.
Walgreens, among the largest U.S. pharmacy chains, said in June it expects to administer 28 million vaccines this year.
The company said on Wednesday it had made masks mandatory for its U.S. employees and required staff working at the country's support offices to be fully vaccinated.
Walgreens became the latest company to update its policies as COVID-19 cases rise in the United States.
New guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommends fully vaccinated individuals wear masks, as well as surging cases due to the Delta variant, have led companies to rethink their policies.
Walgreens said it encouraged customers, including those who are vaccinated, to wear masks. The company added that the vaccination mandate, which requires employees to be inoculated by Sept. 30, does not apply to U.S. employees working in its stores, distribution centers or other facilities.

Rival CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) said employees at its worksites were required to wear masks or face covers, regardless of their vaccination status.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Detroit's Big Three automakers also updated their vaccination and masking policies on Tuesday.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) started to offer its Brazilian Prime subscribers free one-day delivery in 50 cities on Wednesday, amid fierce market competition in Latin America's largest economy.
The move comes as rivals such as  MercadoLibre  (NASDAQ:MELI) and Magazine Luiza are investing heavily to ramp up delivery speeds and gain clients. 
The Amazon initiative, which already exists for Prime subscribers in markets across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, arrives two years after Prime was first launched in Brazil. Previously, Prime users in Brazil had access to free two-day shipping with the option of paying extra for one-day delivery. 
""In the last year, we've developed better infrastructure especially in the country's capital cities with new distribution centers, and this is what helped make one-day delivery possible,"" Mariana Roth, head of Amazon Prime in Brazil told Reuters in an interview.
E-commerce competition is steep in Brazil, home to an estimated 105 million e-commerce shoppers. Amazon ranked fourth in the country in terms of monthly website visits, trailing behind regional and domestic competitors MercadoLibre, Americanas and SoftBank-backed OLX, according to a ranking compiled by payments company Ebanx.
Logistics is an especially tricky part of Brazilian e-commerce, in a continental-sized country with patchy infrastructure. Earlier this year, MercadoLibre announced an investment of 10 billion reais ($1.91 billion) into logistics in Brazil, where, as of June, it has been experimenting with same-day shipping in some cities. 

Roth did not specify how many new Prime users the initiative is expected to attract, nor how much revenue it is predicted to draw for the company.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 08:27AM ET</span>",Brazil retailers hunt for M&A deals to compete for e-commerce dominance,"By Tatiana Bautzer
August 4 (Reuters) - In March last year, Oziel da Silva Santos needed a new TV but with stores closed due to COVID-19 restrictions in Brazil's northern city of Belem, the 50-year old was clueless about how to get one. He followed a link on the website of furniture retailer Via Varejo and called a store manager.
On the other end of the line was Railton Sampaio, a manager at the city's largest Via Varejo. Sampaio helped him buy the TV online, sending the link for payment through the commonly used messaging app WhatsApp.
Santos is one of the millions of Brazilians making a first-time purchase online as a result of the pandemic, a vital new market for the country's biggest retailers. Stores are adapting their strategies - and pursuing merger and acquisition (M&A) to help smooth the transition to internet shopping for inexperienced customers.
In four months, Santos made five more online purchases with Via Varejo salesmen's help, generating commissions for the store's agents. 
Sampaio's sales team is an example of a growing digital strategy among Brazil's largest retailers to increase revenue and attract new online customers after lockdowns shuttered most brick and mortar stores early in the pandemic.
When Brazil's largest cities mandated closure of all stores in March of 2020, Via Varejo's sales dropped 70%. Almost immediately, the retailer mobilized its 20,000 sales people to start selling through social platforms Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp. ""The pandemic accelerated our digital transformation and we did in a few months what was expected for a year,"" Via Varejo CEO Roberto Fulcherberguer said. 
Each store opened a Facebook account, and salespeople first marketed offers to friends and family. The campaign ""Call me on Zap,"" the Brazilian nickname for the popular WhatsApp messaging app, provided online chatrooms with store managers.
'WINNERS AND LOSERS'
Even as physical store locations reopened in recent months due to the national vaccine rollout, Via Varejo and rivals such as Magazine Luiza SA and Lojas Americanas SA continue to push for online sales. At Via Varejo, 56% of revenue comes from online sales, compared to 30% pre-pandemic. 
""Salespeople are now eager to sell online. I get a good part of my commissions online,"" said Karina Ferreira Dias, saleswoman at a large Via Varejo store in Sao Paulo metropolitan area. Unlike other companies, Via Varejo has not reduced staff even when most of its stores were closed. 
Magazine Luiza has a similar strategy. ""During the pandemic, salespeople were able to sell through an app. They get commissions on everything they sell, be it online, third party products in the marketplace or in person,"" said Eduardo Galanternick, its vice president.
The largest companies, Magazine Luiza, Via Varejo and apparel retailer Lojas Renner raised more than $3 billion in combined share offerings and invested proceeds mainly in M&A.
Magazine Luiza and Via Varejo's M&A strategy was to bulk up their digital presence to face increasing competition from panregional rivals such as Mercadolibre (NASDAQ:MELI) Inc, one of Latin America's most valuable companies, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and even AliExpress. They have built large marketplaces with tens of thousands of third party sellers each.
Last month, Via Varejo acquired fintech Celer, aiming to increase financial products it offers through its digital banking and credit app BanQi. It has acquired six companies since last year and created a venture capital fund that will invest 200 million reais over the next five years in tech startups. 
Magazine Luiza bought 12 companies last year, of which nine were tech startups. So far this year, the company has bought 10 companies, including delivery firms, fintechs and e-commerce firms specialized in beauty products, food and videogames.
Most of the deals bolstered the ""omnichannel"" service to consumers, enabling mixes of online and offline services that Brazilian retailers hope will help them compete with big internet companies. Magazine Luiza, for example, has opened 23 news physical stores in Rio de Janeiro last month and plans to reach 50 by the end of the year.
Some retailers, lacking both liquidity during the pandemic and a digital strategy, went into bankruptcy protection, such as bookstore chains Saraiva Livreiros and appliance retailer Maquina de Vendas. They now have a meager chance of emerging from it, financial analysts say.

""The pandemic sharply separated winners and losers in Brazilian retail and what they did during this period will define their future,"" said Ricardo Lacerda, CEO of investment bank BR Partners, who advised some of Brazil's largest retail deals.

Investing.com – Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT) stock was trading 5% lower in Wednesday’s premarket as the high-frequency trader's revenue fell and its second-quarter earnings came in below expectations.
Revenue decreased 39% to $549 million, driven primarily by lower trading volumes in U.S. equities, compared to $905.9 million for the second quarter in 2020, when volumes were significantly elevated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The June quarter of 2020 was one of the most bullish times for equities when the markets just took off after a heavy selloff in February-March as the world came to grips with the pandemic’s onslaught. All market makers benefited. However, trading volumes appear to have cooled since the more panic-stricken first wave of the pandemic.
Adjusted earnings per share was 63 cents, compared to $1.73 for the same period in 2020. This was lower than the 77 cents analysts expected it to get.
As of June 30, Virtu had $915.3 million in cash and equivalents, a deterioration from the $1.02 billion it held three months earlier. As a market maker, the company commits capital by buying securities from, or selling securities to dealers.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp posted record quarterly earnings and Honda Motor Co raised its annual profit forecast on Wednesday as post-lockdown sales surge, but the pair joined other automakers in warning that the global chip shortage would persist.
A resurgence in COVID-19 cases has disrupted parts supplies and production at car companies, compounding a months-long pandemic-fuelled chip crunch.
The two Japanese car makers are facing production problems in China, which on Wednesday reported the most new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases since January.
Honda Executive Vice President Seiji Kuraishi told reporters that the company suspended production at its plant in Wuhan on Aug. 3 due to a COVID-19 case cluster that developed at a supplier. He added that the stoppage was not expected to last long. 
Toyota has suspended production at one assembly line in Guangzhou that it operates with its Chinese joint-venture partner Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. 
The person, who declined to be named due to confidentiality reasons, could not say when the suspension began, how long it would last, nor which models were affected. 
In Thailand too, Toyota, the world's largest automaker by sales volumes, had to suspend production last month at three factories due to a pandemic-related parts shortage.
Still, the company maintained its forecast to sell 8.7 million cars in the year ending March 2022 and said sales volumes in the first quarter recovered to near 2019 levels.
Toyota shares fell as much as 2%, and closed down 0.9%, with some investors disappointed that the company had not lifted its profit guidance despite beating a first-quarter market estimate.
Honda, Japan's No.2 automaker by sales, lowered it sales volume outlook to 4.85 million vehicles from 5 million but raised its full-year forecast after swinging to a first-quarter operating profit that was double analyst expectations.
""We made a downward revision of our sales volume outlook due to the COVID resurgence around the world but centred around Asia, as well as the impact from the chip shortage,"" Kuraishi told reporters.
""Still, we decided to revise up our operating profit forecast for the current year ... because we believe we can absorb those negative effects by continuing to cut costs.""
Toyota also said cost cuts were helping.
CHIP SHORTAGES
""Despite all the headwinds - from the chip shortage, to a COVID resurgence in Southeast Asia, to the slowdown in demand growth in China, as well as a sharp rise in material costs - this was a strong quarter,"" said Masayuki Kubota, Rakuten Securities Inc's chief strategist, referring to Toyota.
Toyota might revise its outlook for the year after the first half, he added.
The company's operating profit soared to 997.49 billion yen ($9.15 billion) for the three months ended June 30 from the pandemic-hit first quarter of last year, beating an average analysts' estimate of 752 billion yen.
Toyota has fared better than rivals through the chip crisis thanks to its much larger stockpile of chips.
The Japanese firm benefitted from a business continuity plan developed in the wake of the Fukushima earthquake in 2011 that required suppliers to stockpile chips, Reuters reported in March.
The global semiconductor chip shortage will cost automakers $110 billion in lost revenues this year, consulting firm AlixPartners said in May.
BMW and Stellantis warned on Tuesday that the shortage will drag on into next year, hitting production and sales even as auto demand booms in markets such as the United States.

On Tuesday, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said it will shut down several North American plants because of the shortage.

BERLIN (Reuters) -New Hugo Boss chief executive Daniel Grieder set the ambitious target of doubling sales and ratcheting up profit margins on Wednesday, as the former head of Tommy Hilfiger stamped his mark on the German fashion house.
The German label, which had been struggling to revive its business for years before being hammered by the pandemic, reported a rebound in sales in the second quarter as lockdowns eased, particularly in Britain and China.
Under Grieder, the company aims to double sales to 4 billion euros ($4.75 billion) from the 2 billion it slumped to in 2020 and restore its operating profit margin to 12% of sales by 2025, the same level it was at in 2019 before the pandemic.
The Swiss CEO, who took over the top job in June, said it was his ambition to make Hugo Boss one of the world's top 100 global brands including by spending more than 100 million euros on marketing between now and 2025.
When Grieder was in charge at Tommy Hilfiger, the U.S. brand grew faster than Hugo Boss, posting sales of $6.9 billion in 2020, far ahead of its German rival. Grieder had put a big focus on expanding online sales at Tommy Hilfiger.
Hugo Boss, known for its smart men's suits, wants ecommerce to account for 25-30% of sales by 2025 from about 16% now. It also plans to refurbish around 80% of its stores, costing around 500 million euros by 2025.
""There is a massive opportunity for premium fashion,"" Grieder said in an online presentation, noting that the size of the high-income population would double in coming years.
Shares in Hugo Boss rose 1.9% at 0830 GMT.
Grieder said Hugo Boss would revamp its brand to make it more modern, adding the colour camel to its black and white branding, and extend a push to appeal to younger consumers, launching the new slogan: ""Be your own Boss"".
He also raised the prospect of new product areas, including make-up, homewear, underwear, jeans and even drinks.
Hugo Boss, which had already reported preliminary second-quarter results last month, said sales were up 7% in the UK, compared with 2019, and up 33% in mainland China, despite calls for a boycott of Western brands launched in March.

While sales of casual styles continued to accelerate, as the working-from-home trend boosts more relaxed dressing, Hugo Boss said it had also seen a recovery in sales of formal wear due to pent-up demand for business and party fashion.
Meanwhile, sales in Europe were just 4% below levels recorded in 2019 and were down 5% in the Americas. Around 20% of the company's global store network was still closed during the second quarter, but online sales grew 27%.

The defective airbags, which in rare instances lead to a rupture in inflator and send potentially deadly metal fragments flying, have resulted in the world's largest automotive recall impacting 100 million vehicles.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said staff at Mercedes call centre told customers it was ""okay"" to use vehicles that were more than six years old and that the recall was precautionary as there have been no major incidents.
By downplaying the risks, the watchdog said consumers were exposed to potentially serious injury or death.
""These alleged representations used language which was inconsistent with the requirements of the compulsory recall notice,"" it said.
Voluntary recalls in Australia due to the defective airbags began in 2009, but it was made compulsory in 2018 to four million defective airbags identified for replacement after a car crash https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-takata-idUSKBN1A80YQ in Sydney that led to one death.
Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), the parent of Mercedes-Benz, said its vehicles were not fitted with Takata 'Alpha' airbags that were identified as a higher risk by the ACCC.
It said since its vehicles were fitted with 'Beta' airbags, the ""recall process overseen by the ACCC did not require affected Mercedes-Benz vehicles to be off the road or owners to cease driving them until the repair was undertaken"".

The ACCC, however, said its recall notice included both Alpha and Beta airbags, citing the death in Sydney and a serious injury to a driver due to defective Beta airbags. 
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) said 97.7% of affected airbags have been replaced to date and it has cooperated with the ACCC through its investigation and made improvements to internal systems and call centre operations to address concerns.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - JDE Peet's , one of the world's largest consumer coffee companies, on Wednesday reported better than expected first-half operating profit, and said it would meet full-year targets despite a spike in green coffee prices after frost struck Brazilian crops last month.
CEO Fabien Simon said green coffee prices had already increased around 20% in 2020 and that the company is also facing increases in transportation and other costs this year -- but it expects to be able to pass those increases on to consumers. 
""Despite these inflations, despite incremental inflation which has been coming through the non-coffee side, we are very confident we will deliver our outlook,"" he said on a call.
He said the size of potential rises is competitive information but the company is now conferring with retailers on how they may be carried out.
""Coffee is pretty unique category in the food and beverage space where headwinds and tailwinds of green coffee are passed through, and we expect that to happen again this time around,"" he said.
""We feel we have pretty good pricing power across our portfolio.""
JDE Peet's, which owns a range of coffee and tea brands including Pickwick, Senseo, Tassimo, TiOra and L'OR, repeated its March forecast for organic sales growth of 3% to 5% for the full year and a ""single-digit"" increase in adjusted EBIT.
For the first half, adjusted operating profit fell 1% to 636 million euros from the same period a year earlier, above analysts' average forecast of 610 million euros.
JDE said that coffee sales growth for home consumption offset an uneven restart for coffee shops due to the coronavirus pandemic -- though shops, driven by U.S. brand Peet's, had returned to profitability.
Overall sales edged up 0.5% to 3.25 billion euros, with sales for at-home consumption, usually coffee purchased at grocery stores, climbing 4.9% on a like-for-like basis.
The company's shares, which had fallen 20% so far this year, rose by 5.6% to 29.94 by 0928 GMT on Wednesday.

Founded by Thai entrepreneur Swin Chatsuwan, a former investment banker now based in the UK, four-year-old Zapp is going to market with a build-to-order business model, according Tony Posawatz, a Zapp investor and adviser who was formerly with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
The launch edition of the Thai-built i300 will be priced at $8,995, with a standard model to follow at $7,495.
A key competitor, the Italian-built, battery-powered Vespa Elettrica, starts at $7,449. Vespa is owned by Piaggio & C SpA .
""This is not your father’s Vespa,"" said Posawatz, who once headed GM’s Chevrolet Volt hybrid electric car program and has advised startup companies from Lucid Group Inc to Inrix.
In stark contrast to the familiar, decades-old Vespa, which was made popular by ""Roman Holiday,"" the 1953 movie starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, the Zapp i300 sports a post-modern design and such features as a swappable lithium-ion battery pack.
The newcomer faces stiff competition from more than two dozen companies, many of them based in China and India, the world’s two largest markets for two-wheelers. Among the more notable rivals: Taiwan-based Gogoro and China’s  Niu Technologies  (NASDAQ:NIU).

Zapp hopes its retail model - order your vehicle online, specify its features, and have it delivered to your door - will help it cut through the competitive thicket.
The company also is planning to use authorized resellers in some markets and may sell directly to corporate customers.

834,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Analysis-Reality bites: China's meddling cools but can't reverse hot commodity prices,"By Emily Chow
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A slew of measures by Chinese authorities to tame soaring raw material costs has had only a fleeting effect, leaving the world's largest manufacturing base facing the harsh reality of substantially higher input costs for the foreseeable future. 
China's enormous manufacturing industry, population and fast-growing economy mean it has uniquely large commodity requirements that substantially exceed domestic output. The recent boom in the price of everything from copper to coal has pushed the country's producer prices up by the most since 2008 and dragged on its recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. 
With major economies in Europe and North America also cranking up again after coronavirus lockdowns, competition for raw materials is only expected to intensify, limiting the near-term downside for prices. 
""Recent steps by Chinese authorities have succeeded in skimming some froth off commodity prices,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics at HSBC. ""Fundamentally, however, prices for raw materials are driven by global supply and demand, which Chinese officials can only influence indirectly.""
China imports roughly half of all key metals, a third of all shipped crops and nearly 20% of global oil shipments. 
But along with unrivalled demand clout comes an acute sensitivity to commodity market volatility and supply chain disruption, requiring policymakers to act whenever market conditions threaten China's critical industry or populace.
China's cabinet called the soaring prices ""unreasonable"" at a May 19 meeting, saying it would strengthen its management of commodity supply. It called for a crackdown on ""malicious trading"" and urged coal producers to raise output. 
Beijing's chief planning agency the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) followed up with two separate probes into the coal and iron ore markets, while China's secretive strategic stockpiler, the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, announced rare sales of key metals aimed at plugging supply gaps and cooling prices. 
The actions, including a further NDRC announcement of new rules requiring more transparency and consistency from commodity price-setters from August, constitute Beijing's most comprehensive market intervention to date and signal a whole of government approach to managing raw material prices.
But prices of most critical inputs - including coal and Shanghai aluminium and zinc - are still perched near multi-year highs.
""You did see a decline in some of the commodities prices... That tells you that (the measures are) effective, at least in the near term,"" said Shan Hui, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asia, who agreed that over the longer-term a comprehensive look at supply and demand was necessary. 
IGNITING INFLATION 
Policymakers' chief concern is that higher commodity prices will accelerate inflation and erode consumer purchasing power and manufacturers' competitiveness, a risk highlighted when a key producer price index surged by its most in 12 years in May.
Although the pace of China's factory gate price growth slowed slightly in June as Beijing's measures kicked in, the 8.8% year-on-year rise remains uncomfortably high for most manufacturers who have limited scope to pass on higher costs amid cut-throat competition.
Some economists maintain that higher costs are transitory and will fade as supply chains recover from the health crisis, but others point to constrained global output, slow ramp-up times for new mining operations, and increasing demand as economies around the world pick up.
Wu Shiping, a Tianfeng Futures analyst, said prices of coking coal, a key steel-making ingredient, were high because of a supply shortage. 
""For iron ore, shipments from major miners fell and the futures market is tracking spot prices,"" he said. 
NOT REASSURING 
The results of Beijing's efforts so far are unlikely to reassure those hoping that authorities can cap further price gains.
Take coal for example - critical for generating power for most factories, offices and homes. When Beijing announced its probe on June 18, Zhengzhou thermal coal futures had not long rallied to a record level above 900 yuan per kilo, gaining 30% in just 6 weeks. 
Despite a dip to below 800 yuan as policymakers' warnings and higher exchange trading fees took some heat out of the market, prices are back near their highs and expected to remain strong as hot weather drives air conditioning demand until Autumn. 
While the price of iron ore, which feeds the country's mammoth steel sector, has fallen by more than a fifth from May's record high, the move is in part due to a curb on the country's steel output to reduce emissions. 
Open interest - a measure of the number of participants with positions in the market - is still at elevated levels, suggesting speculative money was not a big market driver and most position holders are comfortable with the heightened scrutiny.
Meanwhile, state reserve sales have had little meaningful impact on the country's benchmark copper, aluminium and zinc prices, which are holding roughly 30% above year-ago levels.

Noting that supply-side intervention options are limited in the short term, not least because expanding capacity takes time, HSBC's Neumann said further curbing of commodity prices may ultimately require a slowdown in sectors of the Chinese economy that are intensive users of raw materials. 
""There are reasons to expect that this will occur, in part because tighter credit conditions for developers may slow the pace of housing construction,"" he said, adding that China could help companies manage the risks of commodity price volatility by bringing more trading onshore and offering more hedging products.

836,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 06:57AM ET</span>","U.S. Futures Mixed; ADP Jobs Report, GM Results in Focus","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen trading mixed Wednesday, not far removed from the record highs of the previous session with investors studying worrying Covid trends, the ongoing corporate earnings season and the ADP jobs report.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 40 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures outperformed, climbing 6 points, or 0.1%.
The major averages posted strong gains Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping almost 280 points, or 0.8%, the Nasdaq Composite climbing 0.6% and the broad-based S&P 500 gaining 0.8%, to a new all-time closing high. 
However, these indices could well hand back some of these gains Wednesday, as the country struggles with outbreaks of the highly contagious delta variant of the Covid-19 virus, particularly in the states with low vaccination uptakes.
Also of interest is the drop in bond yields, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yielding 1.18% after Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said September could be the time for the central bank to start scaling back its bond purchases.
Citi decided Wednesday to cut its recommendation on U.S. stocks to ‘neutral’, saying U.S. inflation-adjusted ""real"" yields will rise around 70 basis points from current record lows around -1.2% by year-end.
The earnings season continues Wednesday, with General Motors (NYSE:GM) the major company reporting early and the likes of MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) due after the bell.
 Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) will also be in the spotlight after the ride-hailing company reported a quarterly profit three months ahead of target after the close Tuesday, while Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) announced the departure of a number of executives linked to a gender discrimination scandal.
Investors will also be keeping an eye on the ADP monthly report for private-sector hiring, the first of a series of employment data releases, including the weekly initial claims numbers on Thursday and Friday’s official jobs report. Analysts expect ADP to detail 695,000 people having been hired, marginally more than last month’s survey.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Wednesday, continuing recent losses on concerns that mounting Covid cases in both the U.S. and China, the two biggest consumers of crude in the world, will hit fuel demand.
Providing some support was U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, which showed a draw of 879,000 barrels for the week ending Jul. 30. 
Investors now await crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, for confirmation.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $70.14 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $72.13.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,816.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1857.

837,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 06:54AM ET</span>",Citi Cuts Tech-Heavy U.S. Stocks on Treasury Yield Surge Call,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock market returns may suffer as economic recovery and possible monetary tightening are set to fuel a surge in Treasury yields, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). strategists.
Citi downgraded U.S. stocks to neutral from overweight on Wednesday due to the large prevalence of tech companies, which are vulnerable to higher rates. The recent rally in government bonds will be temporary before macro growth fuels a rise in 10-year yields to 2% into 2022, according to Robert Buckland and his colleagues.
READ: Bonds Feel Pull of Sub-Zero Yields as Virus Concern Takes Toll
Bonds have been rebounding in recent months, pushing the 10-year yield down to 1.18% amid a resurgence in Covid-19 cases and concerns that the global recovery isn’t as strong as expected. With the S&P 500 trading at record highs, a possible resumption of the ascent in yields could make the stock market, and growth shares in particular, vulnerable to selloffs.
“The U.S. equity market is more vulnerable to higher real yields because it has a heavy growth stock weighting,” the Citi strategists said in a note.
At the same time, Citi says a jump in Treasury yields is unlikely to be “fatal” for global equities because of strong early-cycle earnings growth supporting risk sentiment. The strategists expect the two factors to cancel each other out over the next 12 months, predicting flat returns for the MSCI World Index by mid-2022.
Citi upgraded Japanese equities to overweight, citing cheap valuations and sensitivity to global cyclical recovery. It also kept U.K. stocks at overweight thanks to their positive correlation to higher bond yields. Among equity sectors, financials and materials will benefit from a rise in borrowing costs, the strategists say.
READ: Europe’s ‘Most Oversold’ Market Still Overlooked: Taking Stock
According to a Bloomberg survey of forecasters, the 10-year Treasury rate will rise to about 1.8% by the end of 2021. Bearish Citi strategists point to technical factors behind the recent drop in yields, such as the unwinding of short positions and supply dynamics, with the march toward 2% likely to resume soon.

Investing.com – Occidental (NYSE:OXY) stock was trading 2% higher in Wednesday’s premarket as a booming demand and higher crude prices swung the company back to profits in the second quarter when most expected it to make a loss.  
Improved crude prices, at their highest since 2018, resulted in better realizations from operations. The company thus nursed the bottom line back to $311 million or 32 cents per share in the June quarter from a loss of $1.69 billion in the same quarter a year ago.

842,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",Sony posts record Q1 profit on pandemic demand for devices and content,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Sony Corp raised its earnings outlook on Wednesday after a record first-quarter operating profit helped by pandemic stay-at-home demand for PlayStation 5 consoles, TVs, music and movies.
Operating profit for the quarter ended June 30 rose to 280.1 billion yen ($2.57 billion) from 221.7 billion yen a year earlier, topping the 207.96 billion expected by 10 analysts, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. 
It raised its profit forecast for the year through March 2022 to 980 billion yen from 930 billion, bringing it closer to the 1 billion yen average estimate from 25 analysts. 
 Sony  (NYSE:SONY) had expected growing pandemic demand for its devices and content to wane as coronavirus lockdowns eased, but with fresh waves of COVID-19 infections sweeping the world, restriction are still common. 
A shortage of semiconductors, however, which is also affecting the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), means it cannot produce enough PlayStation games consoles to meet demand.
Those supply-chain constraints could also affect production of other consumer electronic devices, Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki told a news briefing after Sony's results. 
""We use a lot of semiconductors and it is a source of concern,"" Totoki said. ""We can't become complacent,"" he added.
Sony in May said it expected to sell 14.8 million PS5 units this fiscal year. Launched in core markets in November 2020, the console, which sells for as much as $500, quickly sold out.
Sony has secured enough chips to achieve that production target, Totoki said.
Sony sees the game console as a way to connect its traditional consumer electronics with its growing content business by encouraging online game downloads and sign-ups for subscription services. 
As it streamlines its consumer electronics business, Sony is beefing up its entertainment content and distribution business. In December it agreed to buy AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s animation business Crunchyroll with 3 million subscribers worldwide.
In June it bought Housemarque, a Finnish game software maker. I
Sony also increasing movie offerings on streaming services offered by Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). as the pandemic delays movie theatre releases.
Higher production costs, however, dented profitability, the company said. 
In May, the company indicated that it would continue to expand its content business through acquisition when it said it would spend 2 trillion yen over the next three years on strategic investments, including a push to expand subscribers to its gaming and entertainment services.
In its financial division, Sony posted a 16.8 billion yen one-time loss resulting from an unauthorised fund transfer at a Bermuda subsidiary, SA Reinsurance, in May.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 05:02AM ET</span>","From goal posts to fishnets, German investor Windhorst hurries to clear billion-plus debt","By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lars Windhorst, the businessman behind German soccer club Hertha Berlin, said he will repay more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) within months, by selling assets to rid himself of debt and get his finances on a stable footing.
Windhorst told Reuters in a rare interview that his investments, which include Italian lingerie firm La Perla, a 236-metre tall New York apartment block and a shipbuilder, were worth between 3 and 4 billion euros, outstripping his debts.
As the main investor in one of Germany's biggest soccer clubs, Windhorst's financial situation is closely watched, not least because Hertha's future depends on the support of one of the country's highest-profile businessmen.
Windhorst, who as a teenager quit school to make computers and became one of Germany's best-known entrepreneurs when he was chosen by the then chancellor Helmut Kohl to join trade trips, has maintained a jet-set lifestyle despite a dip in his fortunes.
He emerged from two insolvencies, the first during the dot.com internet bust and the second during the financial crisis, and made headlines when he walked away from a fatal plane crash in 2007.
While saying that his earlier funding was ""risky"", Windhorst added he was now hurrying to repay up to 1.4 billion euros which is still hanging over him after a restructuring in May.
""I took high risks. Sometimes things went wrong,"" Windhorst told Reuters, adding that he had made ""a lot of mistakes"", but that he would soon show criticism of him was misplaced.
""You just need to be successful and sustainably successful and prove everyone wrong. That's why I am getting up every morning. It's not about money."" 
""I'm genuine. I'm honest. We are here to stay,"" added Windhorst, who earlier this year sold his stake in Fyber, a technology start-up, for $600 million. 
During the week of the interview last month, Windhorst said he flew from Switzerland to Berlin to pick up his wife, before jetting to Los Angeles, New York, Washington, and back to Los Angeles, where he spoke to Reuters via video link. 
As well as restructuring his finances, the 44-year-old German now faces a probe by Berlin state prosecutors into his financial dealings although he said this was ""not something which is concerning us"".
Regulators had objected to a 270 million euro loan by one company in his group to another, Netherlands-based Tennor, Windhorst said, adding that this had not broken any rules.
""This is nothing strange and exotic. It doesn't breach any banking regulations. We strongly believe this case will go away,"" he said.
Berlin state prosecutors confirmed the criminal inquiry, but declined further comment. If it is pursued, the probe could see Windhorst, who paid a fine for breach of trust in 2009, back in court.
Windhorst's involvement with Hertha has coincided with a difficult chapter in the history of the club, which is a long way off achieving his vision of becoming a global brand.
Since Windhorst bought a stake in 2019, Hertha, which plays in Germany's top-tier Bundesliga, has battled to avoid relegation and seen the sudden departure of its coach and former German national trainer Juergen Klinsmann.
""We want to make sure we will get out of the danger zone in the new season,"" Windhorst said.
""To my critics: I succeeded, you didn't. I paid. You were wrong. This will be the strongest turnaround story of any football club in Germany. We will have a major global brand.""
DEBT FREE GOAL
Windhorst's restructuring stems from when H2O Asset Management invested in debt of Windhorst-linked companies. 
H2O clients were spooked in 2019 by concerns over liquidity and governance of the Windhorst assets, prompting some to withdraw cash.
In May, after months of wrangling, Windhorst announced a restructuring of some 2.5 billion euros of debt, reducing this to about 1.5 billion euros through write-offs and repayments, he said, paying back investors, chiefly H2O. 
H2O, which is majority owned by French investment bank Natixis, said the deal would cut exposure to Windhorst.
Natixis, which said last year that it would unwind ownership of H20, declined to comment.
Now Windhorst is seeking to clear the ""vast majority"" of the remaining debt by the end of this year and the rest in 2022.
""We expect over a billion euros of cash inflows in the next couple of months with asset sales,"" said Windhorst. 
""We want to be debt free by the middle of next year.""

""In the past, we had long term private debt, which was a risky strategy. We had to be creative and look for more unconventional ways to fund our investments.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - With bated breath, management at Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) is waiting to see if the conglomerate's leader, Jay Y. Lee, will be released on parole this month. 
Support for his parole, both political and amongst the public, has grown amid anxiety that key strategic decisions are not being made at the South Korean tech giant. 
If he is released, Samsung (KS:005930) would be able to move forward with major investment and M&A projects - decisions company sources say should only be made by Lee who has been unable to address them while he sits in jail convicted of bribery and embezzlement.
In particular, a decision on the location of a $17 billion U.S. plant to produce advanced logic chips awaits his return, four Samsung sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
""The word is that the U.S. investment will be finalised when Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee is back,"" said one of the people.
Kinam Kim, head of chips and components at Samsung and one of the firm's three co-CEOs, made a rare direct appeal to President Moon Jae-in in June, arguing Lee's return was crucial. 
""Semiconductors need large investment decisions and the decisions can only be made quickly when the head of the conglomerate is present,"" Moon's office quoted Kim as saying.
Lee served one year of an initial 5-year sentence from August 2017 which was later suspended. That court decision was overturned and the sentence revised to 30 months https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-heir-idUSKBN29M0PQ, putting him back in jail in January this year. Having served some 18 months, he has just become eligible for release.
The Justice Ministry last month eased parole eligibility guidelines for first-time offenders with good behaviour like Lee to 60% of sentence term served. The average eligible time for all criminals in South Korea was 80% prior to the easing. 
Lee's parole is expected to be reviewed on Aug. 9, and within Samsung hopes are high that he will be freed around Aug. 15 when the country celebrates Independence Day and pardons have traditionally been issued, three of the Samsung sources said. 
The Justice Ministry and Samsung declined to comment.
If paroled, Lee would need the Justice Minister to approve his return to work as the law bars persons from working for companies involved in certain convictions for five years. He is likely to get that, legal experts say, as the amount deemed embezzled has been repaid.
While there have been some protests against an early release for Lee and civic groups have voiced opposition, public support for his early release is at about 70%, according to two polls.
A parliamentary committee leader has also voiced his support while other members of the ruling party have visited Samsung's chip complex noting that Lee is eligible for parole.
Support on social media ranges from those who think he has already paid his dues while others fret that without Lee at the helm, South Korea's flagship conglomerate will fall behind competitors at a time when there is a global chip shortage and rivals like TSMC and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) are making large investments https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-investment-plan-idUSKBN2BO3ZJ. 
CASH PILE AWAITS USE 
South Korea's biggest conglomerates are still owned and controlled by their founding families and there is little precedence for handing over the reins to non-family members even when a senior family member has been jailed.
On one hand, Samsung's day-to-day operations have been little affected by Lee's stints in prison. Operating profit in the latest quarter surged 54% and while he was jailed in 2017, Samsung reported its second-largest annual profit of 53.6 trillion won ($46.6 billion).
But experts say Samsung's organisational structure makes it difficult for anyone besides Lee to sign off on strategic decisions that draw on cash pooled from its three main divisions - mobile, consumer electronics and chips.
""Realistically, risky strategic decisions like M&A, multibillion dollar deals, are left to the owner at Samsung,"" said Jaeyong Song, professor at Seoul National University and author of ""The Samsung Way"", a book about Samsung's management style. 
""CEOs in Korea are more like chief operating officers in a way. They take care of the short-term profits, while the owner takes on long-term competitiveness because their tenure is for life.""
Analysts have also linked Lee's legal troubles to Samsung's huge pile of cash, which has swollen 57% over four years to stand at just under $100 billion as of end-June, noting it has not made a major acquisition since 2016.
Chief Financial Officer Choi Yoon-ho told an earnings briefing in January the increase was mainly due to Samsung's inability to ""execute meaningful M&A activities"". 
In addition to the decision on the planned U.S. chip factory - which has come down to Austin, Texas which is widely seen as the favoured location, another area in Texas, New York or Arizona - Lee's return would likely trigger potential acquisitions of stakes in companies, analysts said. 
 NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI), a Dutch maker of automotive chips with a market value of about $58 billion, has often been cited by analysts as a good fit for Samsung's strategic needs and a likely target. NXP declined to comment.

Samsung SDI is considering an investment of at least $3.5 billion in the United States to produce batteries for electric vehicles, but a final decision will rest with a task force for the wider Samsung group and is unlikely to be made before the chip plant decision, one of the sources said.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded broadly higher Wednesday, helped by positive global sentiment, although Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) disappointed with a second-quarter loss.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.2%.
European markets were helped by a positive handover, with Asian markets lifted by China’s services sector recording faster growth in July, while on Wall Street the broad-based S&P 500 closed Tuesday at a fresh record high.
The European second-quarter earnings season, which has been generally positive so far, has continued Wednesday.
 Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW) stock rose 4.2% after the U.K. homebuilder raised its full-year earnings outlook, benefiting from Britain's housing boom, while  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) stock rose 1.2% after the German luxury fashion house said it expected business to continue to rebound in the second half of the year as sales recovered to pre-pandemic levels in Britain and China in the second quarter.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) stock fell 4.5% after the German lender recorded a second-quarter loss as it continues with its major restructuring, involving hundreds of branch closures and 10,000 job cuts. The bank also announced it would write off 200 million euros in the quarter, abandoning a project to outsource securities settlement to HSBC.
The results were an outlier from most of the European banking sector, which has generally beaten expectations this quarter thanks to reserve releases and economic reopening.  
 Thales  (PA:TCFP) stock rose 1.9% after the French aerospace company announced Wednesday that it was in advanced talks to sell its railway signaling business to Japan's Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) for around $2 billion.
Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) stock rose 1.8% after the British engine maker agreed to sell its Norwegian ship engine business Bergen to UK-based Langley Holdings, for around $130 million.
In Switzerland, the mystery over the recent rally in pharma giant  Roche Holding  AG (SIX:RO) was cleared up as SoftBank (OTC:SFTBY) revealed it had taken a $5 billion stake in the company. Roche stock has risen by over 25% since May and added another 0.9% in early trade.
In economic news, the Eurozone July services PMI data rose slightly from the previous month, but came in just below expectations.
Elsewhere, oil prices stabilized Wednesday following consecutive down days on concerns that mounting Covid cases in both the U.S. and China, the two biggest consumers of crude in the world, will hit fuel demand.
Providing support was U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, which showed a draw of 879,000 barrels for the week ending Jul. 30. 
Investors now await crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, for confirmation.
At 4:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $70.73 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $72.75.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,818.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1877.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 03:55AM ET</span>","Commerzbank swings to Q2 loss on restructuring costs, write-off","FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) on Wednesday said that it swung to a second-quarter loss as the lender undergoes a major restructuring and after a write-off to end an outsourcing project, pushing its shares to their lowest in three months.
Germany's No. 2 lender is trying to turn over a new leaf under new Chief Executive Manfred Knof. It is carrying out a 2 billion euro ($2.4 billion) restructuring involving hundreds of branch closures and 10,000 job cuts to get back on a path to profit.
The net loss of 527 million euros ($625.50 million) in the second quarter compares with a profit of 183 million euros a year earlier. 
Analysts had expected a net loss of 504 million euros, and shares traded down as much as 5.4% in Frankfurt.
""Let me be crisp and clear: the execution of our strategy is on track, and I make sure that any road blocks are removed ASAP,"" Knof told analysts.
Commerzbank, which is still partially owned by the state after a bailout during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, is expected to post a loss for the full year as well, according to analysts.
Last month, Commerzbank said it would abandon a project to outsource securities settlement to HSBC and as a result would write off 200 million euros in the quarter. The bank said it was halting the outsourcing plan after identifying risks to its technical implementation.

The bank also announced that it was setting aside 66 million euros to deal with the possibility that customers will try to claw back past price increases after a German court ruling that favours consumers over banking fees.

848,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 03:51AM ET</span>",Thales to sell signalling business to Hitachi in $2 billion deal,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic
PARIS (Reuters) -Thales, Europe's largest defence electronics company, said it was in advanced talks to sell its GTS railway signalling business to Japan's Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) in a deal that values the division at 1.66 billion euros ($2 billion). 
The sale - which confirmed a Reuters exclusive - comes as the French company looks to streamline its sprawling operations and reassure investors of its core focus on making high-tech equipment for the defence and aerospace industries. 
Thales shares were up 2.5% in early trading, among the top performers on the French stock market.
""With this major strategic move, we will be able to focus on the development of our 3 high-tech long-term growth businesses, each of them able to sustainably deliver double-digit margins,"" Thales Chairman and CEO Patrick Caine said in a statement.
Those three businesses are aerospace, defense & security, and digital identity & security. 
Hitachi said the acquisition of Thales' GTS arm should help the Hitachi Rail division reach 1 trillion yen ($9.2 billion)worth of revenue by 2026.
The price tag of 1.66 billion euros corresponds to the enterprise value, including debt, of Thales' unit, dubbed Ground Transportation Systems (GTS).
It reflects a multiple of 13.8 times of the unit's 12-month earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), Thales said in a statement, adding that it expected the deal to close by the end of 2022 or the start of 2023.
Thales also said it was now targeting an EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin of 9.8-10.3%, compared to a previous EBIT margin target of 9.5-10%.
The GTS signalling unit, which also offers train control systems and fare collection services, is small compared with competitors. 
The sale comes at a time of consolidation in the industry as independent players align themselves with bigger industrial groups.
In January, French train maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) closed its 5.5-billion-euro acquisition of Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF)'s rail business, making it the industry's No. 2 worldwide, after China's CRRC.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 03:21AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Peaks everywhere,"(Refiles to fix chart, no changes to text)
A look at the day ahead from Danilo Masoni.
Equity markets continue to rally as if there were no tomorrow, shrugging off COVID-19 and signs of slowing economic growth. Wall Street notched another record high and so did Europe on Tuesday, while in Asia, even COVID-battered India saw stock markets scale a lifetime peak. 
A bounce in Chinese tech stocks was another reason to cheer as the dust settled on the ""spiritual opium"" attack on the video game industry. Tencent's which lost $60 billion off its market cap on Tuesday has recovered around 3%.
Bond markets however seem to be telling a radically different story. Treasury yields are struggling below 1.20%, even after some reassuring factory orders data.
Upcoming data could test this diverging trend. In focus now is the U.S. ADP employment survey, which will set the stage for Friday's payrolls -- the last set of labour figures the Fed will see before Jackson Hole, where some expect a tapering signal. 
The earnings season meantime continues to deliver. And how! Q2 profits at Europe Inc are now seen growing at 140% year-on-year -- the highest rate ever -- while corporate America is set for a 90% surge.
In Asia, Toyota posted a record quarterly operating profit, though a cautious outlook weighed on shares.
Stocks futures flag mild gains in Europe, undeterred by the Q2 loss at Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), while Wall Street are flatlining.
M&A newsflow continues apace. Thales is in talks to sell its railway signalling unit to Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) in a deal valuing the business at $2 billion. On the other hand, the UK is reportedly considering blocking Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s $40 billion acquisition of chip designer Arm.
M&A deals worth $3.3 trillion were recorded during the first seven months of 2021 -- the highest year-to-date total since Refinitiv records began in 1980.

Thailand is battling its biggest COVID-19 outbreak yet, and has been racing to secure vaccines. Last month, THG Chairman Boon Vanasin said talks to clinch a deal with BioNTech was nearing conclusion, but both  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTench said they were not in talks with THG.
""Our problem is that we are unable to import it because it has to come through a government agency,"" Boon said during a televised interview with the MCOT television station on Wednesday. ""I think we won't be able to do it,"" he added. 
Boon did not say with which importer his group had been working. THG shares fell 8.13% on Wednesday along a benchmark decline of 0.35%.
Last month, BioNTech denied it was in talks with THG while a Pfizer spokesman said the company was only in discussions with Thailand's health ministry and disease control department. 
Boon had previously said he was working to secure the vaccines indirectly, via an unnamed government agency.
Thailand has since late April been faced with a surge in COVID-19 infections, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus.
The Southeast Asian country's main vaccine rollout began in June and has depended mainly on Sinovac and locally manufactured AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccines. 
Just over 6% of Thailand's 66 million population been fully vaccinated so far. Delays in the government inoculation programme have been compounded than lower than expected local manufacturing capacity of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

The government has struck a deal for 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, due to arrive later this year, and says it has plans to purchase an additional 10 million doses.

At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
European equity markets received a positive handover from Asia Wednesday, helped by China’s services sector recording faster growth in July, something of a surprise given the concerns about the country’s economic recovery given the latest outbreak of Covid-19 cases.
The Caixin services purchasing managers’ index, released earlier in the day, was 54.9 in July, higher than the 50.3 figure the previous month and at its highest point since May 2021. This private survey contrasted with the official survey released during the previous week, where the non-manufacturing PMI was 53.3, lower than expected.
The figure is likely to be a short-term peak, given that China is resorting to widespread restrictions on social and business life to contain its biggest  Covid-19 outbreak in over a year.

(Reuters) - Private aviation companies are making a beeline for executives wary of flying commercial to business meetings due to a limited offering of direct flights, as corporate travel eases back this fall after a pandemic-induced slump. 
Private air traffic has rebounded above 2019 levels, helped by wealthy leisure travelers avoiding commercial earlier in the pandemic to avoid contracting the virus or due to fewer direct flights. 
Now, some charter companies are trying to extend that advantage to corporate travel, with scheduled flights to some business hubs still below 2019 levels despite a broader leisure-driven rebound in commercial traffic. 
Corporate planemakers like General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)'s Gulfstream Aerospace and  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) are boosting production as demand rises. Rival Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) reports earnings on Thursday. 
Corporate travel, expected to revive this fall, is crucial for aviation because of demand from frequent flyers and airlines' appetite for higher-margin premium fares. 
But a full recovery could take years due to remote work and rising U.S. COVID-19 cases driven by the more aggressive Delta variant.
Major U.S. carriers are restoring routes as restrictions ease. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) will more than double the number of daily flights between the U.S. and Canada starting in September, once fully-vaccinated Americans can fly to the country. 
But major carriers' domestic flights dipped 15.3% in July 2021 compared with 2019, with flights down by half to and from certain business hubs, according to aviation data company Cirium. 
That creates an opening for companies like Airshare, now growing with three new Bombardier Challenger jets this year. Its business traffic has returned to 90% of 2019 levels. 
""For you to be able to get in and out of a destination (by commercial) for a meeting on the same day, it is very difficult,"" said Andy Tretiak, chief marketing officer of Airshare, which offers charter flights among other services. 
""They have to cater their schedule around the airlines,"" Tretiak said in July about his customers who also fly commercial.
""But they would rather do the opposite.""
U.S. commercial airline flights, while soaring over 2020 levels, were still down 20% compared with 2019, according to the weekly average from July 21-28 from FlightAware. By contrast Business aviation flights were up 23% for the week compared with 2019.
David McCown, president of the Americas for Air Partner PLC, which provides aircraft charters among other services, expects to get some new corporate shuttle contracts ""coming online by Q3, certainly by Q4."" 
He said UK-based Air Partner brokered a new shuttle contract in 2020 from an energy company that couldn't find a direct airline flight to Latin America due to cutbacks.
Still, private aviation remains niche and prohibitively expensive. Business aircraft flights account for just 4 percent of traffic at the busiest airports used by commercial airlines, according to the National Business Aviation Association. 
Air Partner's advertised U.S. hourly rate for a midsize cabin is $7,300.
Tretiak acknowledged private aviation can't beat airlines on price, but can attract travelers through fast service at smaller airports. 

In the United States, 9,399 flights were canceled in June, FlightAware said, due to labor shortages, among other reasons. 
""What we’re competing with is the value of your time,"" Tretiak said.

Nayuki, which sells drinks such as fruit teas topped with cheese foam, became the latest company to attract the attention of regulators in China following state media reports. 
State news agency Xinhua reported on Monday that some of Nayuki's stores had cockroaches and staff there used rotten fruit to make drinks. It listed two Nayuki stores in Beijing as guilty of the violations.
Following the report, the southern province of Guangdong said in a statement on Tuesday it held talks with Nayuki on the matter.
Nayuki said in a statement on Wednesday regulatory officials from different cities had made hygiene checks on 186 of its total 603 teahouses across China but found no issues as described by the Xinhua report.
The chain also said it had not been subject to any fines or penalties by regulators. It added that it has set up a task force to investigate food safety issues and that the two Beijing teahouses listed in the media report have suspended operations to facilitate the investigation. 
Sweeping moves by Chinese regulators against the property, education and technology sectors in recent months have spooked investors globally and raised concerns that other industries could be vulnerable. 

On Tuesday, Chinese technology giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) saw $60 billion wiped off its market value in early trade after a state media article described online games as ""spiritual opium"" and re-ignited investor fears about state intervention.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore lenders Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp and United Overseas Bank (OTC:UOVEY) beat profit estimates, driven by recovery in core markets, but their sequential performance slowed sharply, underscoring challenges to maintain growth.
Prospects in Singapore's banking sector have improved as a rebounding economy has boosted demand for mortgages and loans, while booming markets bolstered the wealth management business. 
At the same time, OCBC and UOB joined global peers such as HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) in signalling strong asset quality after last year's huge provisions in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
""The banks' ample reserves and improved earnings provide them with very good buffers,"" said Eugene Tarzimanov, senior credit officer at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service, who expected a moderate increase in the two banks' non-performing loans over the rest of 2021 and 2022, particularly in foreign operations. 
OCBC, Singapore's second-biggest bank, reported net profit of S$1.16 billion ($858.75 million) in April-June versus S$730 million a year earlier. That compared with the S$1.12 billion average of four analyst estimates, Refinitiv data showed. But profit slumped 23% from the first quarter.
As the virulent Delta variant carves a deadly path through Southeast Asia, turning it into a global epicentre of the virus, analysts are concerned that banks' bad loans will increase.
Weaker economic growth in Malaysia and Indonesia prompted OCBC to step up some provisions for potential loan losses in the second quarter, given a resurgence of cases, Chief Executive Helen Wong, who took charge in April, told an online news conference.
The bank's total allowances for loan losses fell 69% in the second quarter from a year earlier.
Quarterly net profit at smaller peer, United Overseas Bank, came in at S$1 billion, beating the S$948 million average of three analyst estimates, according to Refinitiv data. Profit rose 43% from a year earlier as impairment charges more than halved, but profit was flat from the first quarter.
Shares of both banks rose on Wednesday in a strong broader market.
OCBC and UOB increased dividend payouts. Last week, Singapore's central bank removed caps on bank dividends, citing an improving global economic outlook.

Southeast Asia's biggest bank, DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Holdings, reports results on Thursday.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 11:36PM ET</span>","U.S. crime app Citizen rolls out first paid tool, connecting users to safety agents","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) -U.S. crime alert app Citizen is launching its first paid feature, offering subscribers access to a live safety agent when they are in ""stressful or uncertain situations.""
Citizen uses crowd-sourced content and police scanner traffic to notify users in the United States of local incidents. It has been criticized for promoting vigilantism, particularly after it posted a $30,000 reward to find a man wrongly suspected of arson in May. 
The new feature, called Protect, can monitor a subscriber's location if they feel unsafe or connect them through video or text with a Citizen employee who can escalate calls to 911 or first responders.
The agent can also notify a person's emergency contacts or kick off a ""public incident,"" sending an alert for help to other Citizen users in the vicinity.
A spokeswoman said Protect was not aiming to replace 911 but could help reduce the number of non-emergency calls.
""Citizen has been a one-way system to date. We provide real-time situational awareness and our users can decide what to do with it,"" Citizen's chief executive, Andrew Frame, said in a statement. ""Starting today, Citizen is now a two-way system where users can request help from Citizen.""
The app, originally launched in 2016 under the name Vigilante, in recent months has been expanding its remit. Protect, which will cost $19.99 a month, has been in testing with nearly 100,000 users, but will now be available for the app's 8 million users, starting with iOS devices.
Citizen recently caused controversy over what it said was an internal test for a service that would deploy private contractors as rapid-response security personnel to users in Los Angeles. A company spokeswoman said the pilot was not connected to the Protect feature and it has no plans to create its own security force.
Citizen said subscribers can activate Protect by pressing a ""get agent"" button, shaking their phone or via ""distress detection"" mode, which uses technology to monitor a phone's audio to identify sounds like a scream.
It declined to comment on the number of Protect Agents hired. 
Neighborhood safety apps like Citizen, as well as hyper-local site Nextdoor, which racked up users during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Ring's Neighbors community app have come under scrutiny over concerns of surveillance and racial profiling, especially after the murder of George Floyd by a police officer.

Citizen said in a statement that its Protect Agents, who include former law enforcement officers and medical responders, take a four-week certification course and receive training on bias prevention, anti-racism awareness and mental illness.
Citizen has raised more than $130 million in funding from venture capital firms like Greycroft and Sequoia Capital, according to start-up tracker site Crunchbase.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning as investors digested the latest economic data from China. The country's clampdown on various sectors and the spread of the COVID-19 virus’ Delta variant globally capped gains, however.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.53% by 10:33 PM ET (2:33 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.68%. The Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was 54.9 in July, higher than the 50.3 figure from the previous month.
The trend upwards comes as economic data released earlier in the week set the opposite tone. The Caixin manufacturing PMI was a lower-than-expected 50.3 in July, while the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs were 50.4 and 53.3.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.22%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.15%. Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp. (T:9984) shares fell over the possibility that its $40 billion sale of Arm Ltd. to chip company NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) could be blocked.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.95% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.23%.
In the U.S., shares had another record close thanks to corporate earnings. However, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield held its retreat.
Chinese shares in the U.S. slid, with speculation growing that the online gaming could be the next industry to be included in China’s recent regulatory crackdown on sectors including private education and technology.
The speculation was prompted by the Economic Information Daily, an outlet run by the Xinhua News Agency, which published a blistering critique of the industry that called it “spiritual opium”. The critique prompted Tencent Inc to mull a ban on children playing its games, while Alibaba’s revenue missed estimates for the first time in more than two years.
Concerns about the continuous spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, and its impact on the global economic recovery, also capped shares’ gains.
Investors also remain cautious about inflation, and keenly await the latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, due on Friday. The data could dictate market moves should it lead to investors adjusting expectations over the U.S. Federal Reserve’s likely timeline to begin asset tapering.
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida will speak on monetary policy, and the U.S. Treasury will also announce its quarterly refunding, later in the day.
“We think the delta variant is not going to stop the recovery, it’s just going to delay it... the Fed is going to live with a lot more inflation. They don’t want to derail the recovery,” Pence Wealth Management president Laila Pence told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, other central banks handing down policy decisions throughout the week are the Bank of England (BOE) on Thursday and the Reserve Bank of India the day after. BOE is expected to keep both its interest rate and bond-buying target unchanged in its decision.
Also on the data front, New Zealand’s employment change grew 1% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter of 2021, while the unemployment rate was at a lower-than-expected 4%."

(Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Detroit's Big Three automakers joined a growing list of U.S. companies that are changing their vaccination and masking policies as the Delta variant triggers renewed pandemic restrictions.
Microsoft said on Tuesday all employees, vendors and guests will be required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter its U.S. buildings, while meatpacker Tyson Foods said it was mandating vaccinations for its workforce.
""We did not take this decision lightly,"" Tyson Chief Executive Donnie King said. ""We have spent months encouraging our team members to get vaccinated – today, under half of our team members are.""
Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) said any employee who enters its office buildings in its Bay Area, New York, and Albuquerque hubs must show proof of vaccination starting Sept. 7. https:// The U.S. apparel chain also said it will continue to enforce wearing mask within its Bay Area hubs and stores, while in other locations, only unvaccinated employees will need to wear masks indoors, unless required by law.  While not mandating vaccinations, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis NV and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union will reinstate requirements to wear masks at all U.S. plants, offices and warehouses. Surging COVID-19 cases and new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that recommends fully vaccinated individuals wear masks have led companies to rethink their policies. U.S. officials said on Monday that COVID-19 cases, along with hospitalizations and deaths from the virus, have increased in the last week, even as vaccination rates have accelerated amid concerns over the highly contagious Delta variant. Many of corporate America's biggest names have acted following the CDC's guidance, including mask mandates from McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and vaccination requirements by Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS). Tyson said it is negotiating with unions about mandating vaccines for unionized workers, who make up about one-third of its hourly workforce. Rival JBS USA also said it is in talks with unions about vaccine mandates and already requires vaccines for new corporate employees, 
America's largest meatpacking union, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said it is concerning that Tyson is implementing its mandate before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has fully approved vaccines.  Labor unions and meat companies pushed states to speed up the vaccine rollout in the food sector to protect workers and avoid supply-chain disruptions from COVID-19 outbreaks, such as closures of slaughterhouses last year.

Ten of the 11 S&P indexes traded higher, with energy stocks rebounding after getting hit by a dip in oil prices.
“Even though the pandemic is still with us in certain places where there are pockets of this and that, the broad shutdowns of economies are not going to happen.

A clutch of U.S. companies, including industrial materials maker Dupont and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, reported better-than-expected quarterly results, but their shares fell as investors booked profits amid lofty stock valuations. 
A deepening regulatory scrutiny in China has sent jitters through the global technology sector. 
Shares in U.S.- and European-listed gaming companies fell after a steep sell-off in China's social media and video games group Tencent, driven by fears the sector could be next in regulators' crosshairs.

The S&P 500's previous record closing high was 4,422.30.

(Reuters) - Piedmont Lithium Inc expects to receive state regulatory approval for its proposed North Carolina lithium project and have it fully funded by mid-2022, its chief executive said on Tuesday.
Piedmont's project would be among the largest U.S. lithium mines and a key domestic source of the white metal for electric vehicle batteries. But some local North Carolina officials have voiced concerns about its environmental impact and said they may block or delay it.
The company will apply for a state mining permit by mid-August and expects the review process to last six to nine months, CEO Keith Phillips told the Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Virtual Industrials Conference. 
""We're very optimistic of receiving that permit,"" Phillips said, adding he also expects the company to receive a necessary zoning variance from Gaston County, west of Charlotte. Phillips did not forecast a timeline for county approval.
State and county officials could not immediately be reached for comment after regular business hours.
State officials told Reuters last month they expected an application ""in the near future."" County officials have said they would not consider a zoning change until a state permit is issued.
During his presentation, Phillips did not discuss an announcement earlier this week that Piedmont has pushed back its timeline to begin shipments of lithium chemicals to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc . 
To fund the $840 million project, Phillips said Piedmont expects to rely on a U.S. Department of Energy loan and an outside investor who could take a stake in up to half of the project ""and hopefully pay a big price for that. If they don't, we won't bring in a partner.""

Phillips said he hoped to have funding secured by the middle of next year.
The company, which recently took stakes in lithium projects in Quebec and Ghana, likely won't make other acquisitions in the near future, Phillips added.

(Reuters) -Lyft Inc on Tuesday posted an adjusted quarterly profit three months ahead of target, seizing on a leaner cost structure as rides rebounded, but it warned of ongoing driver shortages and the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant.
The company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first time in its nine-year history, and said it would remain profitable on that basis going forward. 
 Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares initially gained 6% in after-hours trading following the announcement but pared gains when executives said during the company's earnings call that revenue per ride was expected to decrease on a sequential quarterly basis.
The company said ongoing investments in driver incentives and a decrease in prices for riders would pressure revenue in the third quarter.
""The road still remains bumpy given the Delta variant and consumer concerns,"" said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore.
Lyft on Tuesday said its platform had continued to grow in July despite increasing concerns over the more contagious Delta variant spreading throughout the United States.
Company executives are watching the spread of the Delta variant.
""We are cautiously keeping an eye on new developments and expect continued volatility and variability among cities,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts said on the conference call. ""Future conditions can change rapidly and may impact our outlook."" 
Lyft on Tuesday posted adjusted EBITDA of $23.8 million for the three months ending in June. The adjustments exclude one-time costs, primarily stock-based compensation, which drove a $252 million net loss. 
Shares of larger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, which reports results on Wednesday, pared initial gains in after-hours trading. Ride-hail is only part of Uber's business, however, with the company increasingly relying on its growing food-delivery unit. 
Lyft said technological and efficiency improvements made over the last two years had allowed it to reduce both fixed and variable costs, allowing the company to keep expenses down even when ridership ramps up to pre-pandemic levels.
The company slashed around $2.5 billion from its expenses in 2020, including through widespread layoffs. 
On a yearly basis, Lyft nearly halved total cost as a share of revenue in the second quarter and costs were also down significantly compared with 2019. 
""Our business model has never been more healthy,"" Lyft President John Zimmer said in an interview with Reuters.
Executives on Tuesday said late-night and weekend trips, as well as rides to airports, had significantly increased during the second quarter, in a sign of the company's most profitable rides returning. 
Overall, ridership grew by more than 3.6 million from the first three months of the year to more than 17 million riders during the second quarter - a time when U.S. cities lifted pandemic-related restrictions and more Americans returned to the road.
Second-quarter revenue came in at $765 million, above analyst estimates for $697 million.
While rising COVID-19 cases created some uncertainty, Lyft's business offered room to grow, said James Cordwell, an analyst with Atlantic Equities. 
""The fact that the company is profitable while active riders are still 20% below pre-COVID levels suggests there is still plenty of upside in terms of Lyft’s profit potential,"" Cordwell added. 
DRIVER SHORTAGE
But Lyft and Uber have struggled to ramp up driver supply as consumers return to their platforms, providing large incentives and payment guarantees in an effort to attract drivers. 
Zimmer said the company had welcomed 50% more new drivers in the second quarter compared with the first and said driver earnings remain at elevated levels across the country.
Executives on Tuesday said they expected more drivers to return in the third quarter, when enhanced U.S. unemployment pay is phased out in all states. Driver numbers have jumped in U.S. states that already stopped enhanced unemployment pay, executives said. 
But driver earnings could remain higher long-term compared with pre-pandemic levels, Zimmer said, with more efficient routing software reducing the overall number of drivers and the miles drivers spend cruising around without a passenger in the backseat.
""The idea is that we can be more efficient, we can do more with less, we can help drivers earn more,"" Zimmer said.

Lyft in July also resumed its shared rides offer, suspended at the start of the pandemic. It allows multiple passengers to split a car traveling in the same direction, but Lyft currently limits shared rides to two passengers, with the middle and front seats remaining empty. 
Lyft executives on Tuesday said shared rides volumes were still too low to tell whether the company's new routing algorithm was working as planned.

In addition, the company said it is contesting in the U.S. Tax Court notices from the Internal Revenue Service seeking to increase its taxable income in three prior years by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of around $3.6 billion, plus interest.
The dispute, which will take several years to resolve, involves Amgen's accounting for profits between the United States and Puerto Rico, the location of most of its manufacturing operations, Chief Financial Officer Peter Griffith said on a conference call with investors.
Amgen's quarterly adjusted earnings, helped by share buybacks, rose 4% from a year earlier to $4.38 per share, beating the $4.10 forecast by Wall Street analysts, as calculated by Refinitiv.
The results ""look generally straightforward,"" but the commentary on the pandemic ""will moderate enthusiasm,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said in an emailed comment.
Amgen shares, which rose 1.8% to close at $244.08, were trading lower at $242 after hours.
Revenue of $6.5 billion was in line with analyst estimates as an 8% increase in unit sales volumes was partially offset by a 5% drop in net selling prices.
For the full year, Amgen said it still expects adjusted earnings of $16.00 to $17.00 per share on revenue of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion.
But the company lowered its 2021 net earnings estimate to $8.84 to $9.90 per share from its prior view of $9.11 to $10.71, and said share repurchases will be at the upper end of its previous estimate of $3 billion to $5 billion.
""This will raise eyebrows a bit given they typically raise guidance for the second half of the year,"" Yee said.

Sales of newer migraine drug Aimovig fell 16% from a year earlier to $82 million, short of the $95 million projected by analysts. Sales of cholesterol fighter Repatha rose 43% to $286 million, but it too missed Wall Street estimates of $299 million.
Amgen also announced on Tuesday plans to build a new drug substance manufacturing facility in Holly Springs, North Carolina.

The agency, which works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law, said it got 343 deal notifications in July alone, up from 112 last July. It said in a statement that the influx ""is straining the agency's capacity to rigorously investigate deals ahead of the statutory deadlines.""
The agency said it was sending letters to some companies planning transactions that although its waiting period would soon expire, the FTC probe was not complete.
""Please be advised that if the parties consummate this transaction before the Commission has completed its investigation, they would do so at their own risk,"" it said.
Commissioner Noah Phillips, a Republican who has been critical of the new leadership at the FTC, said his understanding was that similar letters were sent previously, primarily to companies contemplating a transaction that the agency thought might be illegal.
""The government shouldn’t threaten litigation without a belief the law has been or will be broken. The issue that that raises for me is that if the letters are not being sent where we have some reason to conclude that the transaction is illegal, I am concerned that they are intended to chill legal M&A across the board,"" he said.

In February, the FTC and Justice Department's Antitrust Division temporarily suspended the practice of granting early terminations for the least-controversial deals. It did so because of the change in administrations and a jump in the number of merger filings.
Under merger law, transactions over a certain size must be reported to the government, which allows many to go forward quickly under what is called ""early termination."" More complicated or more controversial deals trigger a ""second request,"" or a demand for documents about the proposed transactions.

After a crushing 2020, oil prices have rebounded to multi-year highs and are now trading at over $70 a barrel, thanks to output curbs by the OPEC+ and a pick-up in economic activity. 
Devon also announced a fixed-plus-variable dividend of 49 cents per share, 44% higher than last quarter's payout, underscoring the energy industry's focus on shareholder returns over spending to expand production.

PGIM, Prudential (NYSE:PUK)'s global investment management business, reported a 2.8% fall in adjusted operating income to $315 million in the second quarter ended June 30, while assets under management rose 8% to a record of $1.5 trillion.
The company's U.S. individual life insurance segment posted an adjusted operating profit of $146 million, compared with a loss of $64 million a year earlier.
Adjusted operating income at its annuity segment soared nearly 90% to $472 million. An annuity is a long-term insurance contract which allows consumers to generate a steady income during retirement.
Global life insurers are taking steps to curb payouts stemming from the health crisis and have been helped by a fall in dental and other non-medical health claims.
Total after-tax adjusted operating income rose to $1.51 billion, or $3.79 per share, from $740 million, or $1.85 per share, a year earlier.

BOSTON (Reuters) -U.S. stocks rose, 10-year Treasuries were flat and oil prices fell on Tuesday as markets weighed mixed signals from corporate earnings and economic growth data.
Wall Street's main stock indexes were choppy in morning trading but later turned positive, with notable gains from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD).
The S&P 500 gained 35.99 points, or 0.82%, to close at 4,423.15 - another record closing high - while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 278.24 points, or 0.8%, to 35,116.4, and the Nasdaq Composite added 80.23 points, or 0.55%, to 14,761.30.
""Today’s market action points to an acknowledgment that earnings are continuing to deliver all the way through,"" said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at $17 billion wealth manager Boston Private. 
Indeed, stronger-than-expected profit reports from U.S. companies in recent weeks have ratcheted up already high Wall Street forecasts on how second-quarter earnings growth will look versus last year.
Saccocia, however, said to expect more volatility later in August ""when all that stands between investors and third-quarter earnings are a whole lot of Fedspeak, more masks and a flurry of mixed economic data.""
Investors want to see July's U.S. non-farm payroll numbers, due on Friday, following dovish commentary from Fed Chief Jerome Powell last week.
A hint came in payroll data that indicates U.S. hiring slowed in July - rather than held steady, as widely expected - with particular softness among states that ended federal unemployment benefits and areas where the COVID-19 Delta variant is raging.
At the same time, new orders for U.S.-made goods increased more than expected in June, while business spending on equipment was solid, pointing to sustained strength in manufacturing even as spending is shifting from goods to services.
""The market is in a holding pattern and somewhat directionless, trying to sort out the tug of war between the delta variant and an economy ready to reach escape velocity,"" said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at $56 billion GW&K Investment Management. 
He said the market's focus is now on ""how extreme any measures to control Delta spread might be."" But he thinks the concern will pass ""and the economy, earnings and stocks will resume their upward trajectory.""
Traders left U.S. Treasury yields little changed as they awaited further indicators. The benchmark 10-year yield held at 1.1722% at the end of the trading day Tuesday, in line with the note's steady march down from this year's high yield of 1.776% reached March 30.
Oil settled lower in volatile trade as concern about rising cases of the Delta coronavirus variant outweighed expectations for another weekly draw in U.S. inventories that had boosted prices early in the session.
Brent crude oil futures settled down 48 cents, or 0.66%, at $72.41 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled down 70 cents, or 0.98%, at $70.56 a barrel.
Spot gold dropped 0.2% to $1,810.05 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.47% to $1,809.50 an ounce.

The U.S. dollar steadied after having lost value against the Japanese yen and Swiss franc as questions about slowing U.S. economic growth and the Delta variant challenged risk appetite.
The dollar index rose 0.037%, with the euro down 0.04% to $1.1862.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd said on Tuesday it would further curb minors' access to its flagship video game, hours after its shares were battered by a state media article that described online games as ""spiritual opium"".
Economic Information Daily cited Tencent's ""Honor of Kings"" in an article in which it said minors were addicted to online games and called for more curbs on the industry. The outlet is affiliated with China's biggest state-run news agency, Xinhua.
The broadside re-ignited investor fears about state intervention after Beijing had already targeted the property, education and technology sectors to curb cost pressures and reassert the primacy of socialism after years of runaway market growth.
""They don’t believe anything is off limit and will react, sometimes overreact, to anything on state media that fits the tech crackdown narrative,” said Ether Yin, partner at Trivium, a Beijing-based consultancy.
China's largest social media and video game firm saw its stock tumble more than 10% in early trade, wiping almost $60 billion from its market capitalisation. 
The stock was on track to fall the most in a decade before trimming losses after the article vanished from the outlet's website and WeChat account on Tuesday afternoon. The article later reappeared later in the day with the historically loaded term ""spiritual opium"" removed and other sections edited. The stock ended down 6.1%.Shares of European and U.S. gaming companies also took a hit. 
Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) which has the largest exposure to Chinese markets among its U.S. peers and was due to report after the closing bell, was down 3.8%.
Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), the company behind Sims, was down 2.8%. Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software, which gave an annual forecast late on Monday that disappointed investors, was down 7.6%. 
Shares of Amsterdam-listed Prosus (OTC:PROSF), which holds a 29% stake in Tencent, fell 6.9%, while European online video gaming stocks Ubisoft and Embracer Group fell about 5% and 3.7%, respectively.
In the original article, the newspaper had singled out ""Honor of Kings"" as the most popular online game among students who, it said, played for up to eight hours a day.
""'Spiritual opium' has grown into an industry worth hundreds of billions,"" the newspaper said. ""No industry, no sport, can be allowed to develop in a way that will destroy a generation.""
Opium is a sensitive subject in China, which ceded Hong Kong island to Britain ""in perpetuity"" in 1842 at the end of the First Opium War, fought over Britain's export of the drug to China where addiction became widespread.
Tencent in a statement said it will introduce more measures to reduce minors' time and money spent on games, starting with ""Honor of Kings"". It also called for an industry ban on gaming for children under 12 years old.
The company did not address the article in its statement, nor did it respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The article also hit rivals' shares. NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc dropped more than 15% before paring losses to end down 7.77%. Game developer XD Inc fell 8.1% and mobile gaming company GMGE Technology Group Ltd dropped 13.59%.
Outside of gaming, investors were also caught off guard by the State Administration For Market Regulation (SAMR) on Tuesday saying it would investigate auto chip distributors and punish any hoarding, collusion and price-gouging. The semiconductor stock index subsequently fell more than 6%.
CHILD WELLBEING
The reposted Economic Information Daily article, in a shift of tone, said that authorities, game developers and families had to work together to combat child addiction to online video games, and parents had to be responsible for supervision. 
Chinese regulators have since 2017 sought to limit the amount of time minors spend playing video games and companies including Tencent already have anti-addiction systems that they say cap young users' game time.
In practice, it is difficult for companies to stop children accessing games online because users can lie about their age.
But authorities have in recent months placed fresh focus on protecting child wellbeing, and said they want to further strengthen rules around online gaming and education. Last month, they banned for-profit tutoring in core school subjects, attacking China's $120 billion private tutoring sector.

That added to other regulatory action in the technology industry, including a ban on Tencent from exclusive music copyright agreements and a fine for unfair market practices.
At one point on Tuesday, Tencent was briefly de-throned as Asia's most-valuable firm by market capitalisation by chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd.

Stocks surged Tuesday despite a similar wave of new Covid-19 cases bursting throughout the South and in California, forcing local and state governments to reinstate mask mandates and prompting calls on businesses to require vaccinations for employees and customers.
In New York City, where the tourism industry is just starting to bounce back from the pandemic, individuals will be required to show proof of vaccination starting later this month to engage in indoor activities in restaurants, gyms and other gathering places. 
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), the largest U.S. meat producer by sales, is requiring all its U.S. employees to be vaccinated by November.
U.S. companies continue to report solid earnings, helping to overcome the fear that rising cases linked to the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus would delay economic recovery.
China’s regulatory crackdown on businesses there is also sending nervous energy into the market, prompting a sharp sell-off in Tencent Holdings Ltd ADR (OTC:TCEHY)this week. 
Another videogame company,  Take-Two Interactive  Software Inc (NASDAQ:TTWO), tumbled nearly 10$ after the maker of ""Grand Theft Auto"" issued a disappointing sales forecast.
On a light day for data, U.S. factory orders rose 1.5% in June after a 2.3% increase in the previous month. Reuters said the economists it polled expected a rise of 1% in June. All eyes continue to be on the jobs report on Friday, though the private payroll reading is due out Wednesday morning from ADP.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. General Motors earnings
General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)reports second quarter earnings Wednesday. The automaker, which is aiming for a big push into electric vehicles over the next few years, is expected to announce earnings per share of $1.69 on revenue of $29.92 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2. Food earnings
Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC), the maker of ketchup, Oscar Mayer hot dogs, Jell-O,  and boxed macaroni and cheese, is seen posting a revenue of $6.55 billion and EPS of 72 cents for the second quarter.
3. More ride-hailing earnings
 Uber Technologies Inc  (NYSE:UBER) is expected to post a loss of 54 cents per share and revenue of $3.74 billion for the second quarter. Its report, due out after Wednesday’s closing bell, follows rival LYFT Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), which reports later on Tuesday.

The shares were at $46.80 in late afternoon trading, marking a third day of gains and taking them well above the price of $38 set in last Wednesday's IPO.
Relatively small trade sizes suggest Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) has become the latest of several stocks driven higher this year in retail investor frenzies, said Sahak Manuelian, managing director of trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. 
""It's the meme du jour,"" Manuelian said.
About $3.6 billion worth of Robinhood shares had changed hands by late afternoon, among the top 10 most heavily traded stocks on Wall Street.
On Thursday, Robinhood tumbled 8% in its first day of trading, surprising some analysts who had expected strong support from the small-time traders it serves and for whom it had taken the unusual step of as much of as 35% the shares in the flotation.
Company executives sold shares a day before the launch, with Chief Executive Vlad Tenev cashing in 1.25 million shares for about $45.5 million, according to filings at the time of the IPO. Those sales were disclosed in advance and any impact had dissipated by Tuesday. 
Star investor Cathie Wood's flagship ARK Innovation ETF has accumulated nearly 5 million Robinhood shares, now worth about $226 million, according to data on the fund's website.
Robinhood's smartphone trading app was instrumental in fueling this year's ""meme"" stock frenzy, but retail investors mostly snubbed the stock on online forums such as Reddit last week.

Shares in the company were among the top five trending stocks on trading-focused social media site Stocktwits on Tuesday, although almost three-quarters of the commentary was negative. The platform is commonly seen as a measure of interest from retail investors.
Robinhood's trading app discourages users to sell shares within the first 30 days of IPOs, restricting them from participating in future IPO deals for two months if they do.

And even though many analysts expect the stock market to witness a correction on concerns over a potential slowdown in the economic recovery, we think it could be wise to bet on quality stocks SS&C Technologies (SSNC) and Preformed Line Products (PLPC) because they both possess a solid combination of value, stability, and momentum features. So, let’s take a closer look at these names.The resurgence of COVID-19 cases due to the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant has been worrying investors regarding the potential for it to slow down the economic recovery. In addition, the consumer price index increased 5.4% in June, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that inflation could be persistent.
However, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) equity strategist David Kostin said recently that “the new strain should not pose a major market risk.” The major stock market indexes continue to be supported by strong corporate earnings. In fact, more S&P 500 companies have beaten EPS estimates for the second quarter than the historical average. Also, the U.S. GDP came in at 6.5% in the second quarter, fueled by massive government aid and increased spending on services.
So, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally strong stocks SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (SSNC) and Preformed Line Products Company (PLPC). In addition to overall A ratings in our POWR Ratings system, these stocks possess a solid combination of value, stability, and momentum attributes.

Now, it seems that these trends are becoming less favorable which could mean weakness is in store for the shiny metal.2021 has been a disappointing year for gold bugs with a year-to-date (YTD) loss of 4.2%. In contrast, the S&P 500 is up nearly 17%. Other commodities such as copper and oil have also been quite strong in 2021 with gains of 27% and 53%, respectively. 
Gold’s underperformance is puzzling, especially as it’s hard to imagine a more bullish set of circumstances for the yellow metal. Over the last 2 years, we’ve had massive deficits due to the coronavirus leading to lower tax receipts and substantially higher spending. In total, 2020’s deficit was $3.1 trillion, and it’s estimated to be $3 trillion this year. Additionally, central banks all over the world slashed rates and purchased assets to ensure that the financial system remained solvent and liquid. On top of this, inflation has also been quite strong and has reached multi-year highs.
I believe that gold’s underperformance, during a period of strong fundamentals, is an ominous harbinger for its near-term outlook. On top of this, there are some bearish catalysts that could lead to more selling.

However, Taylor Dart believes investors should keep a bullish bias due to negative real interest rates and increasing demand from renewable energy sources.It’s been a volatile stretch for the price of silver (SLV) recently despite the gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) holding strong, with silver down 3% for the month of July, while gold enjoyed a 3% return. This bifurcated performance is surprising during a bull market and likely bucked many silver bulls out of their positions. This is because, as of last week’s lows, silver had dove more than 13% in barely 30 trading days, giving up all of its gains following its swing low in late March. Given the backdrop, which remains very bullish for silver with negative real rates and a demand tailwind from renewable energy, the poor price action has caused concern among investors, with this clearly showing up in recent sentiment readings. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: Daily Sentiment Index Data, Author’s Chart)
Since the February spike, the silver ETF (SLV) had slid over 18%, and with hopes of the metal hitting $30.00/oz before year-end drowned out by despondence, we’ve seen a massive shift in sentiment. As shown in the chart above, bullish sentiment has slid from a high of 78% in February to a low of 40% in mid-April and is now looking to re-test the 40% level if the lack of enthusiasm for the trade continues. As of last Friday, bullish sentiment remained below 30% on a short-term basis, briefly dipping to 25%, suggesting that there were three bears for every one bull in the trade. For an asset that is up more 34% in the past year and 125% since the March lows, this is a significant level of bearish sentiment. Notably, the 40% level has been an area where sentiment has reversed on three separate occasions in the past two years, with silver finding a bottom shortly after. Therefore, if this pessimism continues, we will see sentiment move to a contrarian buy signal before month-end.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Detroit's Big Three automakers and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union said on Tuesday they will reinstate requirements to wear masks at all U.S. plants, offices and warehouses beginning on Wednesday, but are not requiring workers to be vaccinated.
The move is in response to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) change in COVID-19 guidance for masks for fully vaccinated people related to the Delta variant, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV said in a joint statement with the union.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said effective Wednesday it will reinstate mask requirements at nearly all U.S. facilities, with the exception of two Michigan facilities that are in counties with moderate transmission rates.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co also said Tuesday it was reinstating its mask requirements for all U.S. employees. Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) said it was requiring masks at U.S. facilities in COVID-19 hot spots, while  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes-Benz U.S. unit said it had reinstated mask requirements at U.S. plants late last week.
The UAW does not support requiring all workers to be vaccinated for COVID-19 and U.S. automakers have not mandated vaccines. The union and automakers are strongly encouraging workers to get vaccinated.
""We are urging all UAW members and their families to get vaccinated. The science is telling us very clearly that the only way to get back to normal is to reach a heightened level of immunity,"" UAW President Ray Curry told members in a letter Tuesday. ""However, we also know that for some, there are religious and health reasons for not getting vaccinated.""
The CDC said last week fully vaccinated people should wear masks indoors in public spaces in places with substantial or high COVID-19 community transmission rates. The CDC said on Monday that almost 80% of U.S. counties are now at those levels.
In June, the U.S. automakers and UAW announced that fully vaccinated workers at their U.S. factories would not have to wear masks on the job beginning on July 12. Numerous automakers operating in the United States had already begun lifting pandemic mask mandates as cases declined.
Other companies as well as federal, state and local governments are putting more pressure on individuals to get vaccinated. New York City on Tuesday said it will require proof of vaccination for people engaged in indoor activities such as dining, working out in a gym, or seeing a show.

Meat packer  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) said it will require workers to get COVID vaccinations, joining companies including Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc in instituting such a requirement for some parts of their workforces. 
U.S. President Joe Biden has ordered workers at federal agencies to get vaccinated or submit to regular testing.

Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) CEO Stewart Butterfield noted that “Nobody would choose office over software.”
With the highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant affecting even vaccinated people, many industry leaders have pushed back their office reopening dates. So, the software industry should continue thriving, at least in the near term.

Thus, we think small-cap retail stocks Guess' (NYSE:GES), Lands' End (LE), Zumiez (NASDAQ:ZUMZ), and Tilly's (NYSE:TLYS) should be valuable additions to one’s portfolio now.The retail industry has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the rapid economic recovery and rising consumer spending. Retail sales increased 0.6% month-over-month in June, surpassing the consensus estimate of 0.4% decline. Over the past few months, increased foot traffic in brick-and-mortar stores amid a strong vaccination drive and pent-up demand for discretionary products has fueled retail sales. Higher shelf prices on account of multi-year high inflation rates have also boosted the sector’s revenues significantly.
While the re-imposition of mask mandates in outdoor spaces might limit retail in-store sales, robust home delivery networks operated by companies since last year should help them maintain their sales levels. Substantial pent-up demand and job growth should drive the retail industry to further growth in the coming months. Indeed, the National Retail Foundation (NRF) expects retail sales to grow between 10.5% - 13.5% to exceed $4.44 trillion in 2021.
Given this backdrop, we believe small-cap retail stocks Guess', Inc. (GES), Lands' End, Inc. (LE),  Zumiez Inc . (ZUMZ), and Tilly's, Inc. (TLYS), with exceptional growth potential, should hit fresh highs soon.

(Reuters) - Video game publisher  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA)'s big bet on mobile gaming will be tested in its quarterly results on Wednesday, as pandemic restrictions ease and gamers leave their consoles to step outside.
EA, the maker of ""FIFA 21"" and ""Apex Legends"", expects its mobile business to grow more than 200% to $2 billion in annual net bookings within the next three years.
""When it comes to the mobile gaming industry, it is important to note that the 'console' is in the user's pocket,"" Berenberg analyst Jamie Bass said.
""Whether one is on the bus to work or waiting in an airport terminal to finally go on holiday again, mobile games remain a persistently tempting and available entertainment option.""
The booming mobile gaming sector, the largest sub-segment of the broader industry in terms of revenue generation, has made EA and rivals such as Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) make significant purchases.
For EA, mobile games make up for more than a tenth of its overall revenue.

THE CONTEXT
EA spent billions of dollars to acquire Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:GLUU), UK-based Codemasters and Playdemic Ltd, to bulk up its mobile gaming portfolio with more gaming titles.
Consumer spending on videogame hardware, content and accessories in the United States alone jumped to a record $56.9 billion in 2020, according to data from research firm NPD.
""They are using this windfall to future-proof themselves by acquiring intellectual property and talent, and by establishing a foothold in new categories,"" Joost Van Dreunen, a lecturer on the business of games at New York University, said.
Acquiring studios with strong mobile franchises will enable EA to inherit the expertise and monetize on the already existing player base at the same time.

PARIS (Reuters) - French firm Thales is in advanced negotiations to sell its railway signaling business to Japan's Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) for nearly 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion), a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
A spokesman for Thales, contacted by Reuters, declined to comment. A representative of Hitachi's European operations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the deal was scheduled to be announced within the next few days.
Thales put its signaling business up for sale earlier this year. 
The sale is part of a drive by the French firm to streamline its sprawling operations and reassure investors it is focused on its core business of making high-tech equipment for the defence and aerospace industries.
The signaling unit is small compared with competitors, and the sale comes at a time of consolidation in the industry when independent players are aligning themselves with bigger industrial groups.
Reuters reported last month that Thales had shortlisted three bidders for the unit: Hitachi Rail, Switzerland's  Stadler Rail  (SIX:SRAIL) and Spain's CAF.

Thales was advised on the sale by Lazard (NYSE:LAZ), while Hitachi's advisors were Perella Weinberg Partners and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), according to the source familiar with the discussions.

(Reuters) - Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) on Tuesday acknowledged that the Delta variant had stalled recovery in Asia Pacific in the second quarter and said it would remain watchful of any further impact on a recovery in hotel occupancy.
Shares of the world's largest hotel chain, which posted a profit beat, were down 1.9% as the broader market also fell due to worries over the Delta variant, which was first detected in India.
Marriott said recovery in its Asia Pacific region, excluding China, stalled in the quarter before picking up pace, as some countries imposed lockdowns due to a rise in infections.
The hotel operator continues to struggle to fill up rooms, with occupancy remaining well below the rates seen before the pandemic but recovering from last year's lows.
""We will continue to be vigilant as we watch the pace of vaccinations around the world, the effectiveness of those vaccinations relative to the Delta variant"" Marriott Chief Executive Anthony Capuano said.
Delta is as contagious as chickenpox and far more contagious than the common cold or flu. It now comprises more than 80% of new cases nationwide and has been detected in more than 90 countries.
Marriott, which owns the hotel brand Ritz-Carlton, said second-quarter occupancy in its key U.S. & Canada and Greater China markets rose to 56.1% and 62.4%, respectively, compared to 19.6% and 35.5% a year earlier.
Comparable RevPAR – a key performance measure – fell 43.8% during the quarter, compared to the second-quarter of 2019.
Shares of rivals Hilton and Hyatt also slumped 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively.

Excluding items, Marriott earned 79 cents per share, versus analysts' average estimate of 45 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Under Armour (NYSE:UA) has cashed in on the demand, sharpening its focus on full-price sales at its brick-and-mortar and online stores and is planning to pull out of 2,000 to 3,000 discount-heavy wholesale outlets to increase its profit margins.
Baltimore-based Under Armour, which has expanded its product lines backed by actor Dwayne Johnson and National Basketball Association's Stephen Curry, has also been investing more in marketing to boost its brand image and tackle competition from  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) and Nike.
""When we come out of this pandemic, we're going to be ready for growth,"" Chief Executive Patrik Frisk told analysts.
Under Armour raised its 2021 forecast for adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to between 50 cents and 52 cents from 28 cents to 30 cents. It also expects revenue to rise in low-20s percentage, compared with a high-teen percentage forecast earlier.
Analysts expect EPS of 35 cents and revenue growth of 19.5%.
""UA is a prime example of a company that used a 'COVID-Cover' to refashion its business for multi-year success and return to under-promising and over-delivering,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said.

Under Armour, however, flagged supply chain issues due to COVID-19 resurgence, particularly in Vietnam, which accounts for about a third of its footwear and apparel supply.
The company's second-quarter net revenue rose 91% to $1.35 billion compared with estimates of $1.21 billion. Excluding items, Under Armour earned 24 cents per share, crushing Refinitiv IBES estimate of six cents.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 01:56PM ET</span>","WHO's pandemic project faces cash crunch amid vaccine, oxygen shortages","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The World Health Organization (WHO) is seeking $11.5 billion in urgent funding to fight the more infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus, a draft report seen by Reuters shows, amid worries wealthy nations are partly bypassing its COVID-19 programmes.
A large portion of the cash being requested from the WHO's partners is needed to buy tests, oxygen and face masks in poorer nations, says the document which is expected to be released this week. And a quarter of it would be to buy hundreds of millions of vaccines for them that would otherwise go elsewhere.
The paper, still subject to changes, outlines the results and financial needs of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), the programme co-led by the WHO to distribute fairly COVID-19 vaccines, drugs and tests across the world.
The programme, set up at the start of the pandemic, remains vastly underfunded, and its coordinators are now acknowledging it will remain so as many governments look to address global COVID needs ""differently"", an ACT-A official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
As a result, it has cut by nearly $5 billion its total request for funds, the document shows. But it still needs $16.8 billion, almost as much as what has been raised so far, and $7.7 billion is required urgently.
The document also calls for a further $3.8 billion, on top of the $7.7 billion, to take up options for 760 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines that would be delivered next year.
""These options to buy need to be exercised in the coming months or vaccine doses will be lost,"" the document warns. 
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week said that $7.7 billion were urgently needed, but did not give a breakdown of planned spending, and did not say how much extra money was needed for vaccines. 
The WHO was not immediately available to comment.
The latest cash crunch will underscore concerns about the long-term future of the programme, which has struggled to secure supplies and equipment to tame a pandemic that has killed more than 4.2 million. 
The vaccine portion of the project, called COVAX, is increasingly reliant on donations from wealthy nations, rather than its own supplies, after key manufacturer India restricted exports of shots to boost domestic vaccinations.
But the United States, European Union and Japan have also donated vaccines directly to countries as part of their vaccine diplomacy drives. Japan has also said it's a quicker process than going through COVAX.
Some countries have provided equipment directly to others too. Last month, Australia said it would donate oxygen-related equipment, antigen test-kits as well as vaccines to Indonesia.
The plea for cash comes as a review of the ACT-A gets under way, with France, Germany and Canada among the countries steering the process. A report on the programme's results and shortcomings is expected in September by consultancy Dalberg Global Development Advisors, the ACT-A official said.
OXYGEN NEEDS
Among ACT-A's immediate needs are $1.2 billion for oxygen to treat seriously ill COVID-19 patients in poorer countries where supplies are low, the report says.
Oxygen has moved up the priority list given vaccines are not available, the ACT-A official said, highlighting the repercussions from the shortage of shots as the Delta variant spreads to 132 countries.
COVAX has delivered about 180 million vaccines, far short of its 2 billion target by the end of this year.
Oxygen is needed to ""control the exponential death surges caused by the Delta variant,"" the document says.
Global demand for medical oxygen is currently more than a dozen times greater than before the pandemic, the document says, but many countries are struggling to access sufficient supplies. 
The urgent need for the most basic treatment against COVID-19 one and a half years into the pandemic shows how little has been done to combat the virus in most of the world, the ACT-A official said, noting: ""There hasn't been much progress. What was urgent three months ago is still urgent now.""
""Inequity in access to life-saving COVID-19 tools has never been more apparent,"" the document says. 
In rich nations, most people have already been vaccinated, including the younger who are less at risk from COVID-19, whereas in poorer nations the most vulnerable are still waiting for a first dose and there is a lack of basic materials, such as face masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE).

""Avoidable death and unsustainable pressure on health systems is mounting in many countries due to insufficient access to oxygen and PPE,"" the document says.
At least $1.7 billion are urgently needed to buy protective devices for healthcare workers in poorer nations, the document says, and another $2.4 billion are needed to boost testing in low-income countries.

(Reuters) - Conocophillips (NYSE:COP) on Tuesday posted a second-quarter profit that nearly doubled from the first and topped analysts estimates, helped by higher oil and gas prices and production. 
A recovery in fuel demand from a pandemic-forced slump has boosted globally-traded crude prices to over $70, raising earnings of oil and gas producers. 
In a departure from previous cycles, however, producers have chosen to boost shareholder payout and slash debt rather than spend on production at the higher prices. 
Tim Leach, executive Vice President of ConocoPhillips' operations in the lower 48 U.S. states, said he expects activity levels to remain consistent for the rest of the year.
The company's production, excluding Libya, rose 4% to 1.55 million boe per day in the second quarter from the first, while prices for its oil and gas rose 10.3% to average $50.03 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe). 
It expects current-quarter production to be between 1.48 million boe per day and 1.52 million boe per day, including seasonal maintenance plans in Alaska and the Asia Pacific region.
The company had cut its 2021 capital expenditures by $200 million from its prior forecast of $5.5 billion in June, and estimates adjusted operating costs to be $100 million lower at $6.1 billion. 
ConocoPhillips raised its share buyback plans in June by $1 billion and increased the expected savings from its $10 billion acquisition of Permian basin producer Concho for a second time. 
Adjusted earnings rose to $1.72 billion, or $1.27 per share, in the second quarter, from $902 million, or 69 cents per share, in the first. 

Analysts had on average estimated a profit of $1.10 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES estimates. 
Shares of the company, which have risen 41% so far this year, were up 1.7% in afternoon trading.

Investing.com – Shares of airline and cruise operators weakened Tuesday as the increase in the number of fresh Covid-19 cases in the U.S. and elsewhere raised fears that lockdowns could return.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), the largely U.S.-focused carrier, fell 2.3% and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) 0.8%. Delta (NYSE:DAL) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) both dipped 0.4%.
Norwegian Cruise (NYSE:NCLH) and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) were down 3% each. Carnival (NYSE:CCL) fell 2%. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) fell 1.6%.
As fresh cases surge, states in the U.S. are back to taking harsher steps to control the spread of the virus. While the U.S. has vaccinated more than half its population with at least one dose of a vaccine, hesitancy and misinformation have slowed the progress even as the economy has reopened.
According to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky, as of Saturday, there were about 72,000 new cases per day of Covid-19 in the U.S., a 44% increase over the previous week and higher than the peak set in the summer of 2020.

Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA)'s relatively new streaming platform is in a race to retain paying customers in the crowded streaming market that includes Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+, which coupled with increased cord-cutting means the company has had to make higher content investments. 
""As we launch new markets during the second half of the year, we expect that we will continue to incur investment losses, though more or less in the same ballpark as this past quarter, mainly driven by content and marketing costs,"" said Gunnar Wiedenfels, the company's finance chief.
Discovery's total paid streaming subscribers stood at 17 million globally at the end of the second quarter compared with Netflix and Disney's 100 million-plus subscriber base. 
Total costs and expenses amounted to $2.28 billion in the quarter ended June 30, up 25% year-on-year. 
The Animal Planet and TLC-owner is also on the brink of combining with AT&T (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia unit to create a new media business, seeking scale to take on its streaming rivals.
""Arguably, streaming is not growing fast enough and financial metrics such as free cash flow are down significantly year-on-year,"" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight.
However, the company's bet is on unscripted programming, including food and home improvement. As the holder of the European rights to the Olympic Games, it is also on track to rake in viewers. 

It said earlier on Tuesday that more than 275 million viewers have so far watched the Games through its platforms, representing a 10% higher reach compared with the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games.

The company, which bought the orange juice maker in 1998 for roughly $3.3 billion and U.S.-based Naked Juice nearly a decade later for $150 million, will keep a 39% stake in the new joint venture and have exclusive U.S. distribution rights for the brands.
The sale will give PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) the funds to develop and grow its portfolio of health-focused snacks and zero-calorie beverages, Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta said, as the company focuses on more profitable brands. 
Rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co has also been streamlining its product range over the past year, discontinuing its TaB diet soda and Coca-Cola Energy brands in the United States and selling its ZICO coconut water brand.
""Companies are finding it difficult to provide effective marketing support behind an infinite number of brands that often compete for very similar occasions,"" Rabobank Food and Beverage analyst Stephen Rannekleiv said in May.
He added that companies are looking to launch new products that have been developed in-house. 
The juice businesses made about $3 billion in net revenue in 2020 for PepsiCo, with operating profit margins that were below the group's.

The deal is one of the many food and beverage investments PAI has made over the last few years. In 2019, Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) sold its U.S. ice cream business, including brands such as Häagen-Dazs, to a joint venture backed by PAI in deal valued at $4 billion.

With progress in 5G deployment, industry participants aim to strengthen their market presence because when paired with developments in artificial intelligence and virtual reality, the new network standard could revolutionize the entertainment industry. The global entertainment market is expected to reach $38.72 billion by 2025, growing at a 4% CAGR.

916,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 12:26PM ET</span>",When the chips are down: global shortage to keep crimping carmakers,"By Nick Carey
LONDON (Reuters) - BMW and Stellantis became the latest major carmakers to warn on Tuesday that the global semiconductor chip shortage that has bedeviled the industry this year will drag on throughout 2021 and beyond, hitting production and sales.
Carmakers, forced by the COVID-19 pandemic to shut down plants last year, face stiff competition from the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip deliveries, hit by a series of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic.
Automobiles have become increasingly dependent on chips - for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking.
Starved of chips, carmakers have focused production on higher-margin models, and have benefited from higher vehicle prices amid low inventories for consumers.
Stellantis chief financial officer Richard Palmer said on Tuesday the world's fourth largest carmaker did not expect chip supply to improve before the fourth quarter, with a total projected production loss of around 1.4 million vehicles in 2021. Chief Executive Carlos Tavares described the shortage as ""the big gorilla in the room.""
BMW, which has so far been less affected by the chip shortage than some of its peers because of strong relations with its suppliers, also said the second half will be more challenging for the German luxury carmaker.
""The longer the supply bottlenecks last, the more tense the situation is likely to become,"" BMW chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in a statement. ""We expect production restrictions to continue in the second half of the year and hence a corresponding impact on sales volumes.""
SPEED BUMP
Other carmakers from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have warned that for the foreseeable future, a lack of chips is the main speed bump. 
""While we're making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last week.
On Tuesday, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) shut down several North American plants because of the shortage, including three next week that make its highly profitable full-size pickup trucks. The No. 1 U.S. automaker called the situation ""complex and very fluid"".
German chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) Technologies also painted a grim picture on Tuesday, saying it was battling extreme tightness in its markets as the latest wave of COVID-19 disrupts production in Asia and inventories hit all-time lows.
""The rebound of global car markets continues to be hampered by acute supply limitations across the entire value chain,"" Infineon CEO Reinhard Ploss told analysts. ""All in all, it will take time to get back to a supply-demand equilibrium."" 
""In our view, this will take until well into 2022,"" Ploss added.
The Ifo economic research institute said on Tuesday that the German car industry and its suppliers faced the worst chip supply shortage in 30 years. A poll showed that 83% of companies were affected, up from 65% in April.

""This is leading to production stoppages,"" Ifo researcher Oliver Falck said. ""The shortages of semiconductors will persist for some time to come.""
On Sunday, French car lobby group CCFA-PFA said the global chip shortage and an upsurge in coronavirus infections would reduce the prospects of a strong rebound by the French car market.

(Reuters) -Strong earnings updates from heavyweights including BP (NYSE:BP) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) drove European stocks to a record-high close on Tuesday, although gains were capped by concerns over rising Delta variant cases and China's regulatory moves.
After dipping into negative territory earlier, the region-wide STOXX 600 index ended up 0.2% at a record closing high of 465.38 points.

French lender Societe Generale jumped 6.4% after it lifted its profit forecast for the full year, while UK-listed Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) gained 1.0% after it reported a higher-than-expected first-half profit.
Second-quarter earnings have been strong, with 66% of the more than half of the STOXX 600 companies that have reported so far topping analysts' profit expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Earnings are also expected to surge by nearly 140% this quarter.
Strong earnings and improving economic readings have brightened the outlook for European stocks this year, with economically-sensitive sectors expected to gain the most. 
""Momentum stocks currently trade at an exceptionally large discount to both growth stocks and the European broad market,"" analysts at BCA Research wrote in a note.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 12:07PM ET</span>",Eli Lilly bets on Alzheimer's disease drug data as it chases Biogen,"By Manas Mishra and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) -Eli Lilly and Co said on Tuesday it plans to seek U.S. approval for its experimental Alzheimer's disease drug by year end and believes the treatment could be favored by doctors once it becomes available to patients.
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) shares were up 4% 
A landmark U.S. approval of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Alzheimer's drug in June has boosted the chances for other medicines that clear plaques from the brain. Several companies including Lilly have been hoping to bring similar drugs to market. 
Eli Lilly said mid-stage data it plans to submit to regulators for its donanemab showed that the drug more effectively cleared amyloid beta brain plaques than any other treatment. 
""If you believe that lowering amyloid plaque is a good thing to do, you're going to want the drug that lowers amyloid plaque the most,"" Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky told investors on a call to discuss quarterly results. 
""There will be some physicians, I'm sure as are today, who still say I don't want to use a drug until I have cognitive data,"" Skovronsky added.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has come under heavy criticism for approving the Biogen drug without definitive evidence of patient benefit and over the objections of its own panel of outside experts. 
Lilly said it was conducting a Phase III trial to prove the drug also helps slow cognitive decline in patients, and expects that study to be completed by 2023.
The FDA approved Biogen's Aduhelm on June 7, using its accelerated approval pathway, which requires a study to confirm the drug works as intended against the fatal mind-wasting disease that afflicts millions of Americans. 
While the FDA nod was initially hailed by patient associations and doctors long awaiting a treatment, it is now subject of a Congressional probe into the controversial approval process and the agency's relationship with Biogen.
In the second quarter, Lilly missed analysts' profit estimates due to low demand for its COVID-19 antibody drugs, which have been dented by the U.S. vaccine rollout.

U.S. regulators in late June halted distribution of the treatment due to low effectiveness against some highly contagious coronavirus variants that have emerged. 
Excluding items, Lilly earned $1.87 per share, missing Wall Street estimates by 2 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data

""This period will provide us with the opportunity to complete unfinished vehicles at the impacted assembly plants and ship those units to dealers,"" GM added.

924,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 11:47AM ET</span>","Mailbox, cameras. How Amazon interfered with Alabama union election -NLRB official","By Mike Spector
(Reuters) - E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) interfered with a union election by installing a mailbox to collect ballots and by distributing paraphernalia encouraging employees to vote against organizing, according to a report by a U.S. National Labor Relations Board hearing officer.
The NLRB official on Monday recommended a rerun of the landmark Amazon union election in Alabama where employees overwhelmingly voted against making their warehouse the online retailer's first to organize in the United States. 
In the coming weeks, a regional director for the NLRB will decide whether to order the rerun based on the recommendation, said an official on Monday with the board, who asked not to be named. 
The election results in April showed workers rejected the effort by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) to organize the Amazon facility by a more than 2-1 margin.
Amazon, recapitulating a statement it provided on Monday, said it would appeal. 
""Our employees had a chance to be heard during a noisy time when all types of voices were weighing into the national debate, and at the end of the day, they voted overwhelmingly in favor of a direct connection with their managers and the company,"" the company said.
Amazon's efforts to have the U.S. Postal Service install a mailbox outside the Bessemer, Alabama, fulfillment center usurped the NLRB's exclusive role in administering union elections and interfered with conditions necessary to conduct a fair vote, according to the hearing officer's report, which the NLRB released on Tuesday. 
Security cameras overlooking the mailbox site gave employees the impression they were under surveillance, the hearing officer found. A tent erected around the mailbox adorned with a company campaign slogan, while not enough on its own to invalidate the vote, amounted to electioneering that tainted the election, she added.
The hearing officer also found objectionable Amazon's distribution of ""vote no"" pins and other anti-organizing paraphernalia to employees in the presence of managers and supervisors. 
Amazon has said the mailbox was installed to give nearly 6,000 eligible voters a convenient option for returning their ballots and that the tent shielded workers from cameras, which predated the collection box. 
It argued that distribution of anti-union materials to employees in the presence of managers was not objectionable because the company did not maintain a list of workers who received the paraphernalia, according to the hearing officer's report.
The hearing officer's recommendation nevertheless casts doubt on Amazon's victory over the unionizing effort in a contest that amounted to a setback for the U.S. labor movement. The union’s organizing campaign drew implicit support from U.S. President Joe Biden and lawmakers, including Senator Bernie Sanders, who visited the warehouse.

U.S. labor law forbids companies from spying on organizing activities or leaving employees with the impression they are under surveillance. It also prohibits other actions if they are found to be coercive. 
Still, employers such as Amazon have wide legal latitude to campaign aggressively, including by requiring employees to attend mandatory meetings that cast unions in a negative light. Amazon held such meetings, sent text messages to employees and even displayed campaign literature in at least one of the Alabama warehouse's restroom stalls.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 11:37AM ET</span>",Baffled investors fear nothing's off limits in China regulatory crackdown,"SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Bewildered investors in China's tech sector scrambled once again from regulators on Tuesday, fearing that a state media story that likened internet gaming to opium signals a new front in the barrage of scrutiny that is being directed toward big business.
The article was later altered to remove the historically loaded opium reference, but, together with the opening of a probe into automotive chip distributors, it roiled markets still smarting from a panic sell-down a week ago.
Tencent, the social-media-to-gaming behemoth, fell 6% and was briefly knocked from its mantle as Asia's most valuable company, while semiconductor stocks slid as the moves seemed to unwind authorities' days-old promise of a calmer hand.
""This drip feed of 'potential' regulations constitutes a tsunami of uncertainties,"" said Richard Kramer, managing partner of Arete Research.
""People want to know when it's time to buy, but there's not yet something concrete in the rules to find as a floor.""
Shares in gaming firm NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) fell nearly 8% on Tuesday while losses were even bigger for game developer XD Inc which fell 8% and mobile gaming company GMGE Technology Group Ltd which dropped almost 14%.
China's CSI All Shares Semiconductor & Semiconductor Equipment Index tumbled over 6%. [.HK][.SS] 
China's State Administration for Market Regulation said it had launched an investigation into auto chip distributors because it suspected price gouging.
The state-media article that sparked Tuesday's tech selling, published in the Economic Information Daily, mentioned a Tencent video game and called for more curbs to address children's' addiction to games it initially described as ""spiritual opium"".
The outlet is affiliated with China's biggest state run news agency, Xinhua. The article soon disappeared from the paper's website and WeChat - and Tencent's stock rebounded a little - then it later re-appeared minus the ""spiritual opium"" line.
It was not clear why it was altered, though opium addiction is a sensitive subject in China where it was widespread in the nineteenth century, sparking two Opium Wars and the ceding of Hong Kong island ""in perpetuity"" to Britain. Traders took the deletion as softening the attack - even if that was only cold comfort. 
""Most will be inclined to believe there's no smoke without fire,"" said Dave Wang, a portfolio manager at Nuvest Capital in Singapore, which owns Tencent stock, of the vanished story.
""There's expectation of a further tightening on the gaming sector,"" he added. ""There are plenty on the sidelines waiting for clarity on when this crackdown will finally come to a close before any more meaningful investments into China."" 
NOTHING OFF LIMITS
Investors believe a major shift is under way in China as the government aggressively pursues reform aimed at cutting cost-of-living pressures at the expense of businesses.
Chaotic selling last week, triggered by leaked details of an education-sector crackdown, capped the worst month for Chinese stocks in nearly three years as investors worried about where the next target may lie.
China's securities regulator, in a meeting with foreign brokerages last week, had sought to soothe fears with a promise of a steadier reform rollout, yet Tuesday's news sparked fresh concern that nowhere is safe.
""(The share price moves) showed how investors are jumpy these days,"" said Ether Yin, partner at Beijing-based consultancy Trivium.
""They don't believe anything is off limit and will react, sometimes over-react, to anything on state media that fit the tech crackdown narrative.""
The nerves have coincided with a slowdown in China's economy - factory activity grew at its slowest pace since February 2020 last month - adding to a broad sense of caution in markets even among investors who say the crackdowns are manageable.

""We see little global spillover risk from China's assertion of greater control over certain industries, even as it potentially leads to market volatility,"" analysts at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute said in a note.
""We remain tactically neutral on China stocks and see further monetary and fiscal policy loosening as beneficial for cyclical assets in China.""

The resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States due to the Delta variant and the new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that requires fully vaccinated individuals to wear masks have led companies to change their plans on vaccinations and masking.

Alibaba's results mirror those of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the United States, as the easing of pandemic-related restrictions has led to more consumers visiting physical stores rather than ordering online.
Core commerce revenue for Alibaba rose about 35% to 180.24 billion yuan in the quarter, compared with estimates of 184.23 billion yuan. In the fourth quarter, the unit's revenue surged more than 70%.
Overall, revenue rose about 34% to 205.74 billion yuan ($31.83 billion) in the first quarter ended June 30, below estimates for 209.39 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net income attributable to shareholders fell to 45.14 billion yuan, compared with 47.59 billion yuan a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned 16.60 yuan per share, above estimates for 14.43 yuan.
Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba Group, recorded a profit of about 13.48 billion yuan in the quarter ended March, according to the Chinese e-commerce giant's filing.
Alibaba, which holds about a third of Ant, posted a profit of 4.49 billion yuan for the quarter ended June 30 from its investments in the financial conglomerate.
Revenue in Alibaba's cloud computing division grew 29% year-on-year, reaching 16.05 billion yuan ($2.49 billion)
The results come amid an ongoing Chinese regulatory crackdown on industry, during which Alibaba has become one of the main targets.
Late last year, regulators halted a planned $37 billion IPO of Ant Group in Shanghai and subsequently called for a restructuring of the financial unit.
In April, China's anti-monopoly regulator fined Alibaba $2.75 billion for engaging in anti-competitive practices.
During an earnings call with investors, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said the company would continue to monitor the impact of ongoing regulatory changes on the company's business.
He cited a recent regulatory crackdown on community marketplace platforms letting sellers offer items below market price as one example of a sector the company is monitoring, in addition to the Data Security Law and an investigation from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology into open links between rival platforms.

""We are in the process of studying the regulatory requirements, evaluating the potential impacts on our relevant businesses and we will respond positively with actions,"" Zhang said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in U.S. and European-listed gaming companies fell on Tuesday after a steep selloff in China's social media and video games group Tencent driven by fears the sector could be next in regulators' crosshairs. 
Shares in Amsterdam-listed tech investment company Prosus (OTC:PROSF), which holds a 29% stake in Tencent, fell as much as 7%, while European online video gaming stocks Ubisoft, Embracer Group and Frontier Developments fell around 4%. Tencent owns 9% of Frontier. 
On Wall Street, video game stocks Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) fell between 3% and 9%. 
The slide in European and U.S. gaming stocks followed a tumble in Tencent, down more than 10% at one point in Hong Kong in a decline that wiped off almost $60 billion from its market capitalisation, after a Chinese state media outlet branded online video games ""spiritual opium"". 
The article by an outlet affiliated with China's biggest state-run news agency Xinhua cited Tencent's ""Honor of Kings"", saying minors were addicted to online games. It called for more curbs on the industry. 
Analysts at Citi said the news was not expected to have a major operational impact on gaming companies outside China, though the reaction showed how jittery the market was on the topic of China tech regulation. 
Grace Peters, EMEA head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, said: ""It's that reminder of regulatory risks in a market that's at all-time highs where some people are looking to lock in profits. Hence we are seeing a small amount of contagion."" 
Investor fears about greater state intervention in China are running high after Beijing's recent targeting of the property, education and technology sectors.

Equita analyst Gianmarco Bonacina downgraded Prosus to ""hold"" from ""buy"", saying he saw Tencent facing increased regulatory risks. ""We believe that the risk of restrictive regulation also on gaming is now more concrete"", he said.

MILAN (Reuters) -Stellantis hiked its 2021 profit margin target on Tuesday after beating first-half earnings forecasts, in an early sign CEO Carlos Tavares might deliver the kind of turnaround he achieved at Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA. 
The world's No. 4 carmaker, formed in January from the merger of PSA and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), said higher prices and cost savings were boosting profitability, with first-half margins at FCA's old North American business hitting a record high.
""You can see his hand in these results, synergies he has realised in just six months are conspicuous, he's doing an excellent job,"" Bestinver analyst Marco Opipari said of Tavares.
Stellantis said it was now aiming for an adjusted operating profit margin of around 10% this year, compared with 5.5%-7.5% previously.
The company, whose brands also include Citroen, Dodge, Jeep and Maserati, said it made around 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in merger-related net cash savings in the first six months of the year. 
Its Milan-listed shares rose as much as 5.3% and were the best performer in Italy's blue-chip index. 
""It's the least we could say to say that Stellantis had a strong start on H1 2021,"" Tavares told analysts on a conference call. ""You have in front of you a very happy CEO."" 
He added that Stellantis was ""still a baby company"" and Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer said he was confident the group would reach its long-term goal of 5 billion euros in annual savings, and it aimed to achieve 80% of them by 2024. 
The new margin forecast assumes no further deterioration in the global semiconductor shortage that has been affecting the whole industry, and no further pandemic lockdowns in Europe and in the United States.
Last month, Tavares warned the semiconductor shortage would drag into next year.
On Tuesday, calling the shortage ""the big gorilla in the room,"" Tavares said he expects to see some improvement in chip supply in the fourth quarter after difficulties in the current three-month period, but visibility remains poor. 
Palmer said the group expects a total projected production loss of around 1.4 million vehicles in 2021.
He added a spike in raw material prices was also a challenge, with its impact felt more in the second half.
In January-June, Stellantis' pro-forma adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) totalled 8.62 billion euros, topping analysts' average forecast of 5.94 billion in a Reuters poll.
Pricing contributed almost 4 billions to first-half EBIT.
Bestinver's Opipari said lower production due to the chip shortage helped the group to keep prices high and boost margins.
""With a constrained vehicle offer, they did not need to make discounts,"" he said.
The carmaker reported an EBIT margin of 11.4% in the first six months, with North America at 16.1% due to record pricing for such vehicles as the Ram pickup. 
Tavares said North America and Europe were ""two strong engines ... pulling the company forward.""
Pro-forma industrial free cash flow was a negative 1.16 billion euros, ""reflecting negative working capital impacts due to unfilled semiconductor orders, offsetting positive net synergies,"" it said.
In a another sign of efficiency gains under Tavares, luxury brand Maserati reported first-half adjusted operating income of 29 million euros after two years in the red.
Regarding China, Tavares said Stellantis was moving ""very well"" toward a ""deep change"" in strategy and was still finalising a few discussions. The new strategy will be in place by the end of the year, he added.
He also said the automaker was ""all in"" on the rollout of electric vehicles (EVs) and would introduce 11 new pure EVs over the next 24 months, bringing the total number to 22 at the end of the period.

Tavares said Stellantis is setting up a software division and would outline that strategy later.

(Reuters) -Shoppers globally are returning to buying Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL)'s Polo shirts, sports coats and dresses, the company said on Tuesday as it benefits from a post-lockdown luxury sales boom and revamped marketing campaigns.
The New York-based retailer's shares rose more than 7% to $126.36 as the company raised its annual revenue forecast, while also beating estimates for first-quarter sales, joining rivals LVMH,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA and Michael Kors-owner Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) Ltd in posting strong results.
Luxury goods companies have benefited from the gradual resumption of social events and gatherings in Europe and the United States over the last few months, as the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines helps ease lockdown restrictions.
""As markets reopen around the world, consumers are shifting back to many of the key categories that drove our business prior to the pandemic,"" Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet said.
The company was working on bringing back dressy casual designs to stores to capitalize on that demand, while scaling back stay-at-home products such as pajamas and sweats, according to Louvet.
Ralph Lauren is also doubling down on marketing this year, promoting its brand by sponsoring the U.S. Olympic team and events such as Wimbledon and Major League Baseball.
Its marketing spend in the first quarter was double that of the year-earlier pandemic-hit period, and about 40% higher than 2019. With global tourism still sluggish, Louvet said the company had shifted its advertising campaigns to target local shoppers rather than tourists.

Ralph Lauren now expects fiscal 2022 revenue to rise between 25% and 30% on a reported basis, having previously estimated a 20% to 25% increase on a comparable basis.
The company's net revenue rose to $1.38 billion in the quarter ended June 26. Analysts had expected revenue of $1.22 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

As demand for semiconductors from car makers to consumer electronics has increased sharply, we think Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) are poised for significant growth this year and beyond. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now. Read on.Both Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) in Santa Clara, Calif., and Mountain View, Calif.-based Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS) are at the forefront of the semiconductor industry, offering integrated graphics processing units, test integrated circuits, and microprocessors to manufacturers, public cloud service providers, and other professionals. AMD operates through two segments: Computing and Graphics; and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom. SNPS operates Fusion Design Platform, a digital design implementation solution; Verification Continuum Platform for virtual prototyping, debug solutions, static and formal verification; and FPGA to perform specific functions.
According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) semiconductor market forecast for spring 2021, annual global sales of semiconductors is expected to increase 19.7% in 2021 and 8.8% in 2022. Since semiconductors are a prerequisite for most endeavors in advanced technologies across most industries—from automotive to electronics—the semiconductor industry is projected to grow substantially this year and beyond. Furthermore, the Biden administration’s plan to reduce dependence on foreign chip suppliers by incentivizing domestic producers should position leading semiconductor players AMD and SNPS for sustainable growth.

938,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 10:26AM ET</span>","Clorox forecasts drop in annual sales as pandemic boom fades, shares fall","(Reuters) -Clorox Co signaled on Tuesday that the pandemic-driven boom in demand for its bleaches, wipes and other surface cleaners was fading due to vaccinations and easing COVID-19 curbs, sending its shares down 12%.
The company forecast fiscal 2022 sales to fall between 2% and 6%, while analysts expected a decline of 1%, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co and Britain's  Reckitt Benckiser  Group Plc (LON:RKT), Clorox (NYSE:CLX) had benefited from consumers stockpiling cleaning products at the height of the pandemic last year. 
But with the opening up of the economy, sales in its mainstay health and wellness unit slumped 17% in the fourth quarter. The household business, which makes Glad trash bags and Kingston charcoal, reported an 8% drop in sales. 
""This was a poor quarter,"" said Edward Jones analyst John Boylan. He added that while the brokerage expected the first half to be difficult due to tough year-ago comparables, normalization of sales and profit would take longer than its initial estimations.
Clorox's results also took a hit from rising costs of raw materials, such as pulp, resin and petrochemical products, that have prompted companies across sectors to increase prices.

Despite a price hike earlier in 2021, its gross margins declined by 970 basis points to 37.1%. That, in part, pulled down its adjusted earnings to 95 cents per share, which missed expectations of $1.35 per share. 
Total net sales fell to $1.80 billion from $1.98 billion, falling short of estimates of $1.92 billion.

Of the 50 U.S. drillers surveyed by BNEF,  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN).,  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co. and Diamondback (NASDAQ:FANG) Energy Inc. are on track to rack up the steepest losses, with more than $1 billion in underwater hedges apiece. The sector as a whole hedged almost one-third of estimated 2021 output and the practical impact is that they are locked in to reap about $5 less than the American benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate.
“One of the negatives of this quarter has been some horrible hedging; guys locked in at $42 a barrel,” Paul Sankey, the veteran oil-industry analyst and founder of Sankey Research LLC, said during an interview on Bloomberg TV.
Hedging helps producers of raw materials mitigate the risk of major price fluctuations and lock in relatively stable cash flows. But the practice carries the risk of leaving money on the table during bull markets.
The losses haven’t been limited to crude drillers. EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT)., America’s biggest natural-gas producer, irritated investors last week by boosting hedges at a time when the commodity also is surging. The company already has booked a $1.3 billion non-cash second-quarter loss on swaps and options contracts.

UniCredit last week agreed to enter into exclusive talks with the Treasury to buy ""selected parts"" of Monte dei Paschi (MPS), which is 64% state-owned after a 2017 bailout.
The two parties have 40 days, barring an extension, to agree a deal on the terms set by UniCredit, which wants the acquisition to boost its earnings per share by at least 10% and its capital to be unaffected.
The potential sale has caused an outcry among Italian politicians, who are urging the government to protect MPS' 21,000 workers and Siena's local economy.
""I don't understand all the alarm on this topic,"" Lando Maria Sileoni, chief of banking union FABI, told Italy's Radio 1.
""The banking sector has a fund to send people into early retirement up to seven years before they actually qualify for their pension: through this system 70,000 workers have opted to retire early [over the past decade], nobody has been fired.""
The fund is financed by banks that need to use it, and each bank bears the cost of its own redundancies. In MPS' case the state would need to fund the early exits, Sileoni said.
The cost for the state's coffers is estimated at around 1.4 billion euros based on expected job cuts at MPS of up to 7,000.
UniCredit is currently selecting the parts of MPS it may buy and has said its goal is to boost its presence in Italy's wealthier centre-north, targeting in particular MPS' franchise in the Tuscany, Lombardy, Emilia Romagna and Veneto regions.
UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel said the bank would try to buy as much as possible of MPS' branch network, while avoiding overlaps where UniCredit is already present. 

State-owned bank MCC is expected to take on MPS' branches in Sicily, Puglia and possibly also in Rome that UniCredit is set to leave behind, a person close with the matter said.
A solution needs to be found for MPS' central offices, which employ 1,400 people in Siena alone, rising to 4,000 when offices in other locations are included, people familiar with the matter said.

Investing.com – Nikola stock (NASDAQ:NKLA) fell 5% Tuesday as the company reported deeper losses for the second quarter even as it promised to deliver pre-series Nikola Tre battery-electric vehicles for use on public roads in the current half.
The company’s second-quarter net loss came at $143.23 million, more than the $115.78 million reported in the same period a year ago.
Adjusted net loss per diluted share was 20 cents compared to a loss of 16 cents in last year’s quarter. The per-share result was better than analysts’ expectation of a loss of 30 cents.
The earnings announcement came five days after the U.S. Department of Justice announced the indictment of Nikola founder Trevor Milton for making false and misleading statements to investors.
The company said Milton resigned from Nikola on September 20 last year and has not been involved in its operations or communications since that time.
The Justice Department alleges that from November 2019 through September 2020, Milton schemed to defraud investors into buying his company stock through statements about its product launches and technology developments.
Milton has previously denied the allegations."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened flat on Tuesday, with an overnight bounce in futures losing vigor against a backdrop of growing concerns about the global economy.
With Covid-19 cases on the rise in both the U.S. and China, fears that the world's two largest economies could resort to fresh lockdowns are mounting. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 20 points, or less than 0.1%, at 34,782 points. The S&P 500 was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%. 
While the U.S. has so far only seen localized reversals of policy on mask-wearing, China is resorting to ever-more dramatic action to stamp out its latest outbreak of the disease, which started when a plane with an infected passenger landed from Russia in the city of Nanjing. The capital Beijing has banned train arrivals from 20 provinces, while authorities said earlier Tuesday that they will require all 12 million residents of Wuhan, the original source of the pandemic, to be tested again.
There were fresh jitters too among Chinese technology stocks, after the gaming sector was attacked by state-run media. Tencent Holdings ADRs (OTC:TCEHY) fell 6.7% to their lowest in over a year, and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) stock fell 9.8%, as participants priced in a new regulatory clampdown. 
Of more significance, arguably, was the 3.4% drop in  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) after the e-commerce giant missed expectations for revenue growth in the second quarter, a further sign after updates from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) last week that the pandemic-fueled growth in some Internet platform companies is slowing.  Another big winner of the pandemic, Clorox (NYSE:CLX) stock, fared even worse  - it fell 11% after the maker of cleaning products warned of fading support from virus fears.
Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock fell 4.7% after the company said Blizzard President J. Allen Brack is leaving the company, which has been embroiled in a controversy over gender discrimination at the workplace. 
Among the gainers were Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD)stock, which was jawboned 5.4% higher by some favorable TV punditry, and Under Armour (NYSE:UA), which rose 4.6% after reporting higher sales of sportsgear as social distancing restrictions were loosened in the spring. The standout performer was biotech startup Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO), which rose 29% after French pharma giant  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) agreed to buy it for some $3.2 billion. 
Elsewhere, the day's only major U.S. data release showed that U.S. manufacturing was still bouncing back handily. Factory orders topped their 2019 levels for the first time with a 1.5% rise, bigger than expected. June's gain was also revised higher from 1.7% to 2.3%.

944,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 09:42AM ET</span>","BP shares climb after payout boost, energising transition","By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) boosted its dividend and share buybacks on Tuesday, sending its shares up by over 5%, after beating expectations with a $2.8 billion second-quarter profit powered by higher oil prices and recovering demand.
The strong results, underpinned by higher sales at petrol stations, went some way towards easing investors' concerns over BP's plan to shift away from oil and gas to renewable and low-carbon energy to combat climate change.
The 4% dividend increase coupled with a $1.4 billion share repurchase over the next three months drove BP shares 5.6% higher by 1130 GMT, exceeding peers Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and TotalEnergies, which were up by over 2%.
Tuesday's announcement brings BP's total shareholder payouts in 2021 to around 4.4 billion pounds ($6.13 billion), representing more than 7% of its market capitalisation, said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
BP, which plans to reduce its oil output by 40% or 1 million barrels per day by 2030, generated surplus cash of $2.4 billion in the first half of the year.
""Investors must now weigh up whether that return offers more than compensation for the risks associated with owning BP's stock, as the company tries to maximise the value of its existing hydrocarbon assets... while investing in renewables,"" Mould said.
Rivals, including Shell, TotalEnergies and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), also boosted shareholder returns last week, reflecting a recovery from the impact of the pandemic on energy demand. 
BP increased its dividend to 5.46 cents after it was halved to 5.25 cents in July 2020 for the first time in a decade. 
(GRAPHIC: BP's dividend - https://graphics.reuters.com/BP-DIVIDEND/gdvzyrarapw/chart.png) 
The company is repurchasing shares after in April announcing a $500 million buyback plan to offset dilution from an employee share distribution programme.
Chief Executive Bernard Looney said stronger performance and an improving outlook would allow the company to press ahead with a shift to cleaner energy. 
""The strengthening of the balance sheet and the excess cash flow allow us to prosecute our agenda around the energy transition,"" Looney told Reuters.
BP expects global oil demand to recover to pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2022.
Its underlying replacement cost profit, the company's definition of net earnings, reached $2.8 billion in the second quarter, beating the $2.15 billion expected by analysts. 
That was up from $2.63 billion in the first quarter and marked a rebound from a loss of $6.68 billion a year earlier.
The results were also buoyed by stronger demand for fuel, including aviation fuel, and higher profit margins at convenience stores in BP's petrol stations, it said.
BP's net debt fell dropped to $32.7 billion from $40.1 billion. 
(GRAPHIC: BP's profits - https://graphics.reuters.com/BP-RESULTS/xmpjogqwbvr/chart.png) 
STRONGER OUTLOOK
BP said it has increased its price forecast for benchmark Brent crude oil to 2030 to reflect expected supply constraints, while also lowering its longer-term price forecast because it expects an acceleration in the transition to renewable energy. 
As a result, the company increased the pre-tax value of its assets by $3 billion, following writedowns of more than $17 billion last year.
The company said at an oil price of $60 a barrel, it expects to be able to buy $1 billion in shares and boost its dividend by 4% annually through 2025.

Brent oil prices rose in the second quarter to an average of $69 a barrel from $61 in the previous quarter and from $29.56 a year earlier.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's auto component makers want Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s potential entry to benefit the country's suppliers, and one way to achieve that is for the company to manufacture locally, the head of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA) said.
Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk said in July that the company was likely to set up a factory in India if successful with imported vehicles after it sought big cuts in import duties on electric cars. 
The demand, reported by Reuters, has polarised the auto industry in the country and prompted a rare public debate among carmakers over whether easing import tax rates runs contrary to India's push to promote domestic manufacturing. 
""We will always promote localisation,"" Deepak Jain, ACMA president told reporters on Tuesday, when asked about the industry body's views on Tesla's demand. 
""We would welcome any foreign or domestic entry, capacity expansions on any vehicle segment as long as it promotes value addition and localisation, which gives the opportunity for the component sector to flourish,"" he said.
Some industry executives argue that India does not have a robust supply chain or domestic production of electric vehicle (EV) components such as motors or lithium cells and would need to rely on imports, at least in the short-term.
Jain said ACMA is in talks with the government to identify which EV parts can be manufactured locally, but also warned that companies may struggle to make large investments at a time when sales have been slow for over two years. 
ACMA's comments supporting local production are similar to those made last week by companies like  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), the top-seller of electric cars in the country, and Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group-backed Ola, which is making electric scooters in India.
Supporting import duty cuts, however, are South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, which has an about 18% share of India's car market, and German automaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz.

Santosh Iyer, vice president, sales and marketing at Mercedes in India told Reuters that luxury car customers are early adopters of new technology and once they start taking to EVs it trickles down.
""To give confidence to carmakers, if India is able to liberalise the import tax then companies like Mercedes can test the market and choose to manufacture EV models locally,"" he said.

PCG’s operating expenses for the second quarter (ended June 30, 2021) increased 7.8% year-over-year to $4.58 billion, driven by costs related to the amortization of wildfire insurance fund contributions, the investigation of remedies, reorganization under Chapter 11, and wildfire-related expenses. It also witnessed a decline in interest from the hedge funds. So, the stock’s prospects look bleak in the near term.

Investing.com – Clorox (NYSE:CLX) stock plummeted 11% in Tuesday’s premarket trading as inflation and weaker demand for cleaning products dented its fourth-quarter sales and profits.
The company was a major beneficiary of the pandemic-induced scare as well as urge among the consumers to stock up on anything they thought would keep germs and viruses away. Cleaning of surfaces several times during the day became the norm. Sales of cleaning agents, disinfectants and sanitizers boomed then.
The elevated demand came off in the June quarter as vaccinations gathered pace, the scare weakened, and people stepped out to lead normal lives.
The maker of bleaches and stain removers has projected 2022 sales to be down 2% to 6% from last year's comparatively high first half, when the pandemic raged.
The company also warned of higher commodity and manufacturing and logistics costs, most notably in transportation, hurting its margins.
Adjusted EPS is projected to be between $5.40 and $5.70, a decrease of between 26% and 21%, respectively.
Fourth-quarter net sales fell 9% from a year ago to $1.8 billion. Adjusted earnings per share fell to less than one-third of last time’s, coming at 78 cents compared to $2.41 in June quarter of 2020.
While sales fell, cost of raw materials rose as chemicals and additives got more expensive. As a percentage of net sales, cost of products grew to 63% compared to 53% for last year’s quarter.

The total value of UK deals in the seven months was $198 billion, a more than threefold increase on the same period last year, which included the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Deals involving a British target totalled $34.9 billion in July, 5% less than June but more than seven times the value in July 2020. 
The increase has coincided with the British economy's faster than expected rebound from the coronavirus crisis and reduced Brexit uncertainty since leaving the European Union. 
British companies have been relatively cheap compared with U.S rivals when measured on a price-to-earnings ratio, with the FTSE 100 trading at 15.6 against 26.9 for the S&P 500, Refinitiv data shows. The FTSE 250 index of mid-cap companies is trading at 9.9 times.
One of those FTSE 250 constituents could be about to leave after defence and aerospace company  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT) agreed to a 6.3 billion pound ($8.77 billion) takeover by U.S. rival Parker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH) on Monday. 
Britain's fourth-largest supermarket group Morrisons has also agreed to be bought for the same price by the Softbank-owned Fortress group and could yet receive a counter-bid from CD&R. 
""The UK takeover spree continues to move at pace, with yet another FTSE 250 stock receiving a bid,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould after Meggitt recommended the takeover.
""UK stocks have long been considered cheap and this year's M&A spree shows that overseas investors have finally got enough confidence to pounce on opportunities after years of showing little interest in the market."" 

One deal that completed in the first half of 2021, boosting M&A numbers, was the $11 billion purchase by  National Grid  (LON:NG) of Western Power Distribution, England's largest electricity distribution business.

All other employees are required to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 1, the company said in a statement Tuesday. The company will also provide $200 to its frontline workers, subject to ongoing discussions with locations represented by unions.
The mandate comes amid a surge in Covid-19 cases across the U.S. brought on by the fast-spreading delta variant. The meat industry was roiled by the initial outbreak of the pandemic, with thousands of plant workers catching the virus and hundreds dying.
Exceptions to the vaccination mandate will involve workers who seek medical or religious accommodation, Tyson said.

Cummins, which benefited from higher demand for trucks amid a boom in the e-commerce sector and a rising preference for personal vehicles, reported a jump of 75% in the engine segment's sales, its biggest unit. 
The company's large customers PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR), Navistar (NYSE:NAV),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Chrysler have also reported strong quarterly results.
Net income for the second quarter ended July 4 rose to $600 million, or $4.10 per share, from $276 million, or $1.86 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $4.05 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Columbus, Indiana-based Cummins' net sales rose 58.6% to $6.11 billion, its highest since 2019 and above analysts' expectations of about $6 billion.
The company also said it was exploring options for its filtration unit, which generated sales of about $1.2 billion in 2020.
Shares of Cummins were up 1.7% in premarket trade.

951,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",Amazon warehouse workers overwhelmingly rejected a union. Now they may vote again,"By Nandita Bose and Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - A U.S. labor board official has recommended a rerun of a landmark Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) union election in Alabama where employees had voted overwhelmingly against making their warehouse the online retailer's first to organize in the United States.
In the coming weeks, a regional director for the U.S. National Labor Relations Board will decide whether to order the rerun based on this recommendation, said an official on Monday with the board who asked not to be named.
The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which workers rejected joining earlier this year by a more than 2-1 margin, had said Amazon illegally threatened staff with reduced benefits and compromised the election's integrity via a ballot collection box it secured outside the warehouse.
The labor official's recommendation in support of a new election focused on problems with the collection box, a person familiar with the matter said. Reuters has not seen a copy of the recommendation, which a labor board official said may be released Tuesday. 
Amazon said it planned to appeal. 
""Our employees had a chance to be heard during a noisy time when all types of voices were weighing into the national debate, and at the end of the day, they voted overwhelmingly in favor of a direct connection with their managers and the company,"" Amazon said in a statement.
Stuart Appelbaum, the RWDSU's president, welcomed the recommendation Monday and said, ""The question of whether or not to have a union is supposed to be the workers’ decision and not the employer's.""
During a May hearing that lasted three weeks, the RWDSU had argued Amazon improperly influenced voting by pressuring employees to drop ballots in the mailbox while they were in view of warehouse cameras, creating a perception of surveillance that U.S. labor law forbids. Amazon also improperly adorned a tent surrounding the mailbox with messaging related to its anti-union campaign, the RWDSU had said.
Amazon has said the mailbox was installed to give nearly 6,000 eligible voters a convenient option for returning their ballots and that the tent shielded workers from cameras, which predated the collection box.
The recommendation casts doubt on Amazon's victory over the unionizing effort in a contest that amounted to a setback for the U.S. labor movement. The union’s organizing campaign drew implicit support from U.S. President Joe Biden and lawmakers including Senator Bernie Sanders, who visited the warehouse.

U.S. labor law forbids companies from threatening to cut benefits or close facilities when workers support a union. The law also prohibits them from spying on organizing activities or leaving employees with the impression they are under surveillance.
Still, employers such as Amazon have wide legal latitude to campaign aggressively, including by requiring employees to attend mandatory meetings that cast unions in a negative light. Amazon held such meetings, sent text messages to employees and even displayed campaign literature in at least one of the Alabama warehouse's restroom stalls.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 08:32AM ET</span>",Analysis-Tougher terms: why the EU is paying more for new COVID shots,"(Adds tag, no change to text)
By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union has agreed to pay a premium on new orders of COVID-19 vaccines because it is requiring tougher terms to be met, European officials said, as the bloc tries to protect supplies after a rocky start to its vaccination campaign.
The higher price is less than the United States has agreed to pay in its latest order in July.
On Sunday, the Financial Times reported the EU has agreed to pay  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech 19.5 euros ($23.1) for each of their COVID-19 shots under a contract signed in May for up to 1.8 billion doses, up from the 15.5 euros per dose under two initial supply contracts for a total of 600 million vaccines. This was in line with previous reports.
The price for  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shots went up to $25.5 a dose, the newspaper said, referring to a 300 million vaccine deal, up from $22.6 in its initial deal for 160 million jabs.
EU lawmaker Tiziana Beghin, a member of Italy's 5-star ruling party, said the EU was being been ripped off.
""It's inexplicable,"" she said.
Moderna's price is still at the lower end of the $25-$37 range indicated by the company last year, but Pfizer and BioNTech had previously said prices would be lower for bigger volume deals. 
Others said there were good reasons to pay more and that circumstances had changed greatly from when initial deals were struck with drugmakers last year.
France's European affairs minister Clement Beaune told French radio RFI on Monday the likely higher prices were still under negotiation and were the result of stricter clauses on variants, production and deliveries.
One European official familiar with negotiations with vaccine makers said the value of the drugmakers' shots had risen since evidence had emerged of their efficacy and of the positive impact they had on helping the economy to recover from a pandemic-induced recession.
""Several factors played a role,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
BARGAINING POWER
All the vaccines used in Europe have been shown to have a beneficial impact, but those made by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), have faced restrictions on their use in the EU because of concerns they can in rare instances lead to blood clots.
Those two vaccine makers have also suffered supply problems, which in the case of AstraZeneca have led to legal challenges by the EU.
While the bargaining power of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna has increased, additional EU demands are likely to raise the costs of making and delivering vaccines.
A spokesman for Pfizer declined to comment on the European prices, but said the latest contract with the EU was different from the initial ones, including on matters concerning production and delivery. 
Moderna did not respond to a request for comment.
The European Commission, which coordinates negotiations with vaccine makers together with EU governments' representatives, declined to comment on prices.
However, a spokeswoman told a news conference on Tuesday that in talks with vaccine makers the EU considers several elements, including companies' production capacity, delivery schedules and the technology they use.
Earlier this year, lawmakers, media and some analysts criticised the bloc for paying too little for the early supplies of COVID-19 vaccines, saying that had contributed to initial delays in the vaccination drive.
""It's easy to criticise the EU because it spends little and late or because it spends too much,"" said Giovanna De Maio, non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, a U.S. research group.
""Reality is much more complicated, and perhaps it is correct to give priority to access to vaccines rather than costs given the pace at which the Delta variant is spreading,"" she added, referring to the more transmissible variant that was first detected in India.
On July 23, Washington bought an additional 200 million vaccines from Pfizer at a price of $24 a dose (20.1 euros), the company said, up from $19.5 the United States paid for its first 300 million shots.
Pfizer said the higher U.S. prices reflected investment needed to produce, package and deliver new formulations of the vaccine, as well as extra costs in producing smaller pack sizes suited to ""individual provider offices, including paediatricians"".
MADE IN THE EU
When the EU agreed in May its third supply deal with Pfizer for up to 1.8 billion doses, the Commission said the new contract required the vaccines to be made in the EU and the essential components to be sourced from the region.
In its first supply deals, the EU had required that only vaccines were made in the EU, not their components.
Concentrating production in Europe can help to guarantee supply now that production lines are well established and there is less need for leeway, but it is also likely to increase costs.
The EU Commission also said in its statement that under the new contract ""from the start of the supply in 2022, the delivery to the EU is guaranteed,"" whereas under the first contract Pfizer was only required to make its ""best reasonable efforts"" to ship pre-agreed volumes by set deadlines.
Pfizer has so far respected its commitments to the EU, and has delivered slightly more than initially planned in the first quarter of the year.
Another big change since the early contracts is the emergence of variants and concerns vaccines may not be effective against them.

EU officials said governments could refuse to buy shots that did not protect against variants, while companies will be expected to quickly adapt their vaccines, potentially at significant cost.

Investing.com –  Alibaba  ADR (NYSE:BABA) was trading weaker in Tuesday’s premarket as the Chinese internet giant’s first-quarter revenue came below expectations and user growth slowed.
Revenue in the June quarter was RMB205.74 billion ($31.86 billion), an increase of 34% year-over-year and below the analysts’ expectation of RMB209.16 billion.
But for last year’s acquisition of supermarket chain Sun Art, the gap would been even wider.
Excluding the consolidation of Sun Art, revenue would have grown 22% year-over-year to RMB187.30 billion ($29 billion), according to Alibaba.
The company’s Chinese marketplaces notched up 939 monthly active users for June, up 14 million from March’s 925 million. The March figure was higher by 23 million from December’s, reflecting slowing growth as consumers step out of the pandemic to return to normal times.
Besides the Sun Art consolidation, growth in the company’s Cloud computing and commerce businesses drove revenue. The Sun Art business is now part of Alibaba’s commerce operations.
The commerce business benefited from more people using the platform to order their daily stuff from groceries to electronics. The company also said it generated more revenue from recommendation feeds and better search monetization. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted ADS were RMB16.6, higher than the estimated RMB14.37."

In a sign that Chief Executive Frederic Oudea's turnaround strategy is starting to pay off, Societe Generale now expects revenue to grow in all its businesses this year, including in French retail banking, where it had flagged a possible fall.
Under pressure to boost profitability, Oudea has been trying to revive the lender after losses from stock-linked derivatives wiped out equity trading in the first and second quarters of 2020, while a cumbersome retail banking structure hindered growth.
France's third-largest listed lender, after BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) SA, also forecast its cost of risk, which reflects provisions against bad loans, would be 20-25 basis points this year, down from a previous estimate of 30-35 basis points. 
LASTING RECOVERY 
Shares in SocGen were up 6.56% to 26.50 euros at 1121 GMT. The stock has more than doubled since it touched near 30-year lows in autumn last year when it closed at 10.90 euros on Sept. 25, according to Refinitiv data.
""CIB (corporate and investment banking) turnaround is on track and French retail top line also surprised positively with a strong +8% year-on-year rebound,"" analysts at J.P. Morgan Cazenove said in a note.
SocGen said its cost of risk fell 88.9% in the second quarter, mirroring that of rivals including Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) and BNP Paribas, which slashed provisions for unpaid loans as the global economy gradually recovering from the worst of the COVID-19 crisis. 
SocGen posted second-quarter net income of 1.44 billion euros ($1.71 billion), compared with a loss of 1.26 billion euros a year earlier. Revenue rose 18.2% to 6.26 billion euros. 
Oudea said at a news conference he expected the rebound in activity to last. When asked about mergers and acquisitions (M&A), he told analysts the bank had the capacity to grow organically, adding that any M&A deals would need to comply with the bank's target on capital.
In France, where the government ended a third nationwide lockdown in mid-May, retail banking revenue rose 8.7%.
Revenue was up 24.5% in its corporate and investment banking (CIB) businesses, which SocGen began revamping two months ago by shifting resources into dealmaking and reducing its trading arm's exposure to market swings.
Equity trading revenue was five times higher than a year earlier, while fixed income and currency trading fell 33%. 

The head of SocGen's CIB division, Slawomir Krupa, said he expected the environment in equities markets to remain ""reasonably good"".

PARIS (Reuters) -  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) has agreed to buy U.S. biotech company Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO) in a $3.2 billion deal, as it bets on next-generation mRNA vaccine technology beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, confirming a Reuters exclusive report.
The French pharmaceuticals firm said it would acquire all outstanding shares of Translate Bio for $38.00 per share in cash, representing a total equity value of about $3.2 billion.
The boards of both companies have approved the deal, and the chief executive of Translate Bio and the U.S. company's largest shareholder have backed it, Sanofi and Translate Bio said in a joint statement. 
Sanofi shares were little changed at 86.73 euros as of 1125 GMT.
""Translate Bio adds an mRNA technology platform and strong capabilities to our research, further advancing our ability to explore the promise of this technology to develop both best-in-class vaccines and therapeutics,"" Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD) said.
Sanofi's offer of $38 represented a 30.4% premium on the New York-listed company's Aug. 2 closing share price. 
In pre-market U.S. trading on Tuesday, Translate Bio's stock was up almost 30% in line with the Sanofi offer. In extended trading late on Monday after the Reuters report and before the financial terms had been announced, they had soared more than 70% to above $50.
INFLUENZA
Sanofi's bid for Translate Bio marks the latest interest by a large pharmaceutical company in mRNA technology, following its proven success in COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
Analysts said the price made strategic sense, a long-term wager on mRNA vaccine technology beyond COVID-19 by one of the world's top flu vaccine makers. 
""Since COVID, mRNA vaccines have made a big impact on the future of vaccine R&D and the most obvious target for next-generation mRNA vaccines is influenza,"" Liberum wrote in a briefing note.
The messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid) approach, an area of Translate Bio expertise, instructs human cells to make specific proteins that produce an immune response to a given disease. Sanofi and Translate Bio joined forces last year to develop an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. They expect interim results of their Phase I/II clinical trial in the third quarter.
The two companies are also looking at mRNA vaccines for several infectious diseases and in June started a Phase I trial evaluating a possible mRNA-based vaccine against seasonal flu.
Rival Moderna launched a Phase I/II trial into a possible mRNA flu shot in July.
TOUGH YEAR
Sanofi expects to complete the acquisition in the third quarter of 2021.
Translate Bio's chief executive and its largest shareholder, Baupost Group, signed binding commitments to support the deal. Their shares combined with those already held by Sanofi represent about 30% of Translate Bio's total shares outstanding. Sanofi's interest comes after a tough year for the French drugmaker after falling behind rivals in the COVID-19 vaccine race, a major blow to CEO Hudson who joined the company almost two years ago. Sanofi warned last year its traditional, protein-based COVID-19 jab developed with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) showed an insufficient immune response in older people, delaying its launch until toward the end of 2021. Hudson has also been under increasing pressure to reduce the company's dependence on its star eczema treatment Dupixent to boost earnings. 

Earlier this year, Sanofi agreed to fill and pack millions of doses of shots made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Moderna. Translate Bio, set up in 2016, has not launched any drugs on the market but its clinical-stage pulmonary product using its mRNA platform is being tested as an inhaled treatment for cystic fibrosis in a Phase I/II clinical trial.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc said on Tuesday its after-tax distributable earnings more than doubled in the second quarter, driven by a sharp rise in income from transaction fees and asset sales from its private equity portfolio.
Buyout firms have been thriving as a dealmaking boom, fueled by a stock market rally and cheap debt, has allowed them to sell assets for top dollar. Last month, Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc also reported that their distributable earnings doubled.
KKR's after-tax distributable earnings rose to $925.6 million in the second quarter, up from $365.6 million posted a year ago. Its after-tax distributable earnings per share of $1.05 surpassed the average Wall Street analyst estimate of 84 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.
KKR said it invested $19 billion of its capital during the quarter for acquisitions of companies such as information technology services provider Ensono for $1.7 billion, and 37.5% of FiberCop, an Italian fiber optic joint venture, for 1.8 billion euros ($2.11 billion).
KKR said it generated $605.6 million from asset sales, including from the divestment of its stake in mixed martial arts company Ultimate Fighting Championship and the sale of workplace software firm Calabrio Inc to Thoma Bravo LP.
A surge in revenue from its investments and the booking of income from its insurance business contributed to a net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $1.3 billion, up 83% from $698.6 million last year.
Funds in KKR's private equity portfolio appreciated by 9%, while its opportunistic real estate funds rose 10% in the second quarter. Its leveraged credit funds rose 2%. 
In comparison, KKR's peers Blackstone and Carlyle had reported that their private equity portfolios rose 12% and 13.8%, respectively.
KKR said it raised a record $59 billion in new capital in the second quarter, driven by fundraising in its flagship North America, infrastructure and core private equity funds. 

As a result, its assets under management rose 17% to $429 billion from $367 billion in March. Unspent capital also surged to $112 billion from $69 billion three months earlier, owing to the pace of fundraising.
KKR declared a regular dividend of $0.145 per share.

Investing.com – PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) stock was trading 1.1% higher in premarket Tuesday as the snacks food giant decided to sell Tropicana, Naked and other juice brands in North America and Europe to private-equity firm PAI Partners.
Pre-tax proceeds to PepsiCo from the sale are pegged at $3.3 billion.
PepsiCo will take a 39% stake in a new joint venture with PAI. It will retain exclusive distribution rights for small-format and foodservice channels in the U.S.
Consumers have been slowly shifting away from juices and high-sugar, high-calorie drinks in search for healthier alternatives, as obesity and diabetes remain big health concerns the world over.
PepsiCo has also been under pressure from shareholders to shore up its margins, which in the case of the juice business, have been lower than its overall margins.
The juice businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2020, PepsiCo said.
The Frito Lay-maker had bought Tropicana from Seagram for $3.3 billion in 1998. Naked Juice was bought in 2006.
PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said the deal frees the company to concentrate on healthier snacks, zero-calorie beverages, and products like SodaStream.
The company expects to use the proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet and make organic investments. The transaction is expected to close by early 2022.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A trade group representing some of America's biggest baked goods companies is urging the Biden administration to ratchet back its biofuel ambitions, arguing that using fuel made from crops could raise the cost of donuts, bread and other foods.
The complaints mark an unusual entrance by the food industry into the U.S. energy policy debate, and puts it in an unwitting alliance with Big Oil, which has for years opposed regulations requiring that fuels made from corn, soybeans and other crops be added to the nation's gasoline and diesel.
The American Bakers Association, which represents companies like the grocer Kroger (NYSE:KR), donut maker Krispy Kreme and Tastykake parent company Flower Foods, told Reuters it met with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last week to urge reduced blending mandates, particularly for biodiesel.
The EPA administers the nation's biofuels laws.
The group has also met with lawmakers involved in the issue to press its case, according to its president Robb MacKie.
MacKie said the group held the meetings because its members are hearing from suppliers of soy and canola oil - staple ingredients in many foods - that they could run short of stocks by the end of the year as demand from the biofuels industry compounds already tight global markets.
""We are trying to ring the alarm without being alarmists,"" MacKie said. 
Baked goods companies want the Biden administration to lower biodiesel blending mandates to 2019 levels or at least ""hold the line"" on any growth, he said. 
It was unclear whether their demands would have any impact on EPA's decision-making. 
The EPA is currently considering new biofuel volumes requirements for the coming year under the nation's biofuel law, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a process that has been delayed by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and by treacherous political considerations.
Nick Conger, an EPA spokesman, confirmed the agency met with the baker's trade group, but did not offer details.
""EPA always appreciates input from stakeholders, and we are taking their concerns into account along with those of the many other RFS stakeholders,"" Conger said. 
Around 40% of soy oil consumed in the United States goes to producing fuel, with most of the rest going into food, according to U.S. government data. 
BATTLE WIDENS
The RFS, adopted in 2005 to help farmers and reduce fuel dependence, has created a nearly 20 billion gallon per year market for the U.S. Farm Belt. But oil refiners say it has also created a costly regulatory burden that threatens to bankrupt smaller refining facilities.
Until now, the fight over the policy has been restricted mainly to those two constituencies.
Kurt Kovarik, Vice President of Federal Affairs for the National Biodiesel Board, said now is not the time to slow the progress of biodiesel, which he said is among the cleanest, low-carbon fuels available.
""America's agricultural sector is still emerging from years of disruptions due to trade wars and weather events. The COVID emergency continues to impact markets, including agriculture. Undercutting the Renewable Fuel Standard is not a solution,"" Kovarik said.

The average price of food in the United States climbed 2.4% in the 12 months ended June, rising from the previous 2.2% increase, according to the U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Domestic production of biodiesel is around 130,000 barrels per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher at the open Tuesday, with investors focusing on the corporate earnings season and the risk of slowing economic growth as Covid cases rise.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 160 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 16 points, or 0.4%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures gained 16 points, or 0.1%.
The second-quarter earnings season has been generally positive, with over 88% of the corporate reports beating analysts' second-quarter profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data, the highest percentage on record based on data going back to 1994.
More earnings are due Tuesday, with the likes of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), Under Armour (NYSE:UA),  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) set to release numbers during the session.
Away from earnings, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) will be in the spotlight after an article in a state-owned Chinese daily criticized videogaming companies and the impact they have on the young, stoking fears that the gaming sector may be next in the firing line of the Chinese authorities. The article was subsequently taken down and reposted without some of its strongest criticisms.
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) announced plans to sell its controlling stake in Tropicana, Naked and other juice brands in North America to private equity firm PAI Partners for $3.3 billion.
Still, any equity gains are likely to be limited with the rise of U.S. Covid-19 cases keeping investors on edge.  
There were about 72,000 new cases per day in the United States as of Saturday, a 44 percent increase over the previous week and higher than the peak set in the summer of 2020, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
“Things are going to get worse” as the delta variant fuels a surge in cases, according to U.S. infectious-disease expert Anthony Fauci earlier this week, but he did not expect the U.S. to lock down businesses again.
The economic data slate only really includes June factory orders, which are expected to show growth of 1.0%, a fall from May’s 1.7% drop, while Federal Reserve's Richard Clarida and Michelle Bowman both speak later Tuesday.
Elsewhere, crude prices edged higher, helped by strong results from oil major BP (NYSE:BP) which joined its rivals in paying an enhanced dividend and increasing the pace of stock buybacks.
Of interest later in the session will be the latest forecasts of U.S. crude and product inventories for last week from the American Petroleum Institute.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $71.58 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $73.22.

The company made its announcements after returning to profit in the second quarter, beating expectations as a strong economic rebound across much of the world this year sent crude oil prices to their highest since 2018.  
BP posted underlying replacement cost profit, used as proxy for net profit, of $2.79 billion. That compared with a loss of $6.68 billion over the same period a year ago.
Adjusted earnings per share were 83 cents, higher than the estimated 58 cents.
Sales and other operating revenue came at $36.46 billion, 72% higher than $21.26 billion in the second quarter of 2020. This was below analysts’ expectations of $38.53 billion.  
The company said it will annually increase its dividend by 4% through 2025, starting from the second quarter. It had slashed payouts last year to conserve cash as the pandemic took world prices to unprecedented lows
BP also said it expects to deliver buybacks of around $1 billion per quarter. The targets for dividend and buyback assume crude prices at $60 per barrel.

The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in a statement that the bank's failure to disclose its financial interests in the reports published between 2004 and 2018 was attributed to an error in using legacy technology, which tracked the share holdings of UBS.
The fines were also related to four other compliance breaches, including the bank's failure to record 35 telephone lines between August 2017 and 2019 involving over 2,000 transactions executed for more than 400 clients. 
UBS reported the issue to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which then alerted the SFC, the regulator said.
The bank was also found to not have received proper authorisation from 91 clients who were not classified as professional investors in respect of 913 securities pooled lending transactions. 
It did not obtain previous trading evidence from clients participating in some derivatives deal to assess their knowledge and also did not inform 15 clients of the ""stop loss event"" mechanism on a structured note deal, the SFC said.
""UBS self-identified and reported these matters to the Hong Kong regulators as soon as we found the issues,"" the bank said in a statement.

""We immediately took steps to strengthen our internal controls and systems in order to prevent the issues from happening again.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Much stronger-than-expected profit reports from U.S. companies in recent weeks have ratcheted up already high Wall Street forecasts on how second-quarter earnings growth will look versus last year.
Earnings are now expected to have climbed about 90% in the second quarter versus analysts' forecasts of 65.4% at the start of July, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, with results in so far from roughly 300 of the S&P 500 companies as of Monday morning. 
Nearly 89% of the reports are beating analysts' second-quarter profit estimates - the highest percentage on record, based on Refinitiv data going back to 1994.
A gangbuster second quarter is expected to mark a peak for recent U.S. earnings growth as companies recover from the depths of last year's pandemic-induced profit collapse.
""Except for a few disappointments here and there, everybody has had solid earnings. It has been a tremendous earnings season, but it was supposed to be,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
""It will be interesting when you start getting deeper into third and fourth quarters. The market might be anticipating a bit of a trip-up.""
Third-quarter earnings are estimated to climb 29.6% from a year-ago quarter. Fourth-quarter earnings are seen gaining 21.2%, based on Refinitiv data.
In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings 16.6% above expectations, compared with an average of 20.1% for the prior four quarters and an average of 3.9% going back to 1994, based on Refinitiv data.
Companies that have contributed the most to the big gains in profit growth include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Financial companies make up half of the top 10 contributors to growth so far this season, Refinitiv data shows.
""Surprises have been positive, large and broad-based across sectors and industry groups,"" but ""returns on results"" have been mixed, UBS strategists including Keith Parker wrote in a note Monday.

The S&P 500 is roughly flat since the unofficial start of the earnings season on July 13.
Among companies left to report on the quarter are many of the big U.S. retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT).

973,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 05:51AM ET</span>","Exclusive-ADB, Citi, HSBC, Prudential hatch plan for Asian coal-fired closures -sources","By Clara Denina and Melanie Burton
LONDON/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Financial firms including British insurer Prudential (NYSE:PUK), lenders Citi and HSBC and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Real Assets are devising plans to speed the closure of Asia's coal-fired power plants in order to lower the biggest source of carbon emissions, five people with knowledge of the initiative said.
The novel proposal, which is being driven by the Asian Development Bank, offers a potentially workable model and early talks with Asian governments and multilateral banks are promising, the sources told Reuters.
The group plans to create public-private partnerships to buy out the plants and wind them down within 15 years, far sooner than their usual life, giving workers time to retire or find new jobs and allowing countries to shift to renewable energy sources.
It aims to have a model ready for the COP26 climate conference which is being held in Glasgow, Scotland in November.
""The private sector has great ideas on how to address climate change and we are bridging the gap between them and the official-sector actors,"" ADB Vice President Ahmed M. Saeed said.
The initiative comes as commercial and development banks, under pressure from large investors, pull back from financing new power plants in order to meet climate targets.
Saeed said that a first purchase under the proposed scheme, which will comprise a mix of equity, debt and concessional finance, could come as soon as next year.
""If you can come up with an orderly way to replace those plants sooner and retire them sooner, but not overnight, that opens up a more predictable, massively bigger space for renewables,"" Donald Kanak, chairman of Prudential's Insurance Growth Markets, who came up with the idea, told Reuters.
Coal-fired power accounts for about a fifth of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, making it the biggest polluter. The proposed mechanism entails raising low cost, blended finance which would be used for a carbon reduction facility, while a separate facility would fund renewable incentives.
HSBC declined to comment on the plan.
Finding a way for developing nations in Asia, which has the world's newest fleet of coal plants and more under construction, to make the most of the billions already spent and switch to renewables has proved a major challenge.
The International Energy Agency expects global coal demand to rise 4.5% in 2021, with Asia making up 80% of that growth.
Meanwhile, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is calling for a drop in coal-fired electricity from 38% to 9% of global generation by 2030 and to 0.6% by 2050.
MAKING IT VIABLE
The proposed carbon reduction facility would buy and operate coal-fired power plants, at a lower cost of capital than is available to commercial plants, allowing them to run at a wider margin but for less time in order to generate similar returns.
The cash flow would repay debt and investors.
The other facility would be used to jump start investments in renewables and storage to take over the energy load from the plants as it grows, attracting finance on its own. 
(GRAPHIC: Illustration of the Energy Transition Mechanism - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lgpdwmqzwvo/ETM4.png) 
The model is already familiar to infrastructure investors who rely on blended finance in so-called public-private deals, backed by government-financed institutions. 
In this case, development banks would take the biggest risk by agreeing to take first loss as holders of junior debt as well as accepting a lower return, according to the proposal.
""To make this viable on more than one or two plants, you've got to get private investors,"" Michael Paulus, head of Citi's Asia-Pacific public sector group, who is involved in the initiative, told Reuters. 
""There are some who are interested but they are not going to do it for free. They may not need a normal return of 10-12%, they may do it for less. But they are not going to accept 1 or 2%. We are trying to figure out some way to make this work.""
Citi declined further comment.
The framework has already been presented to ASEAN finance ministers, the European Commission and European development officials, Kanak, who co-chairs the ASEAN Hub of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership, said. 
Details still to be finalised include ways to encourage coal plant owners to sell, what to do with the plants once they are retired, any rehabilitation requirements, and what role if any carbon credits may play.
The firms aim to attract finance and other commitments at COP26, when governments will be asked to commit to more ambitious emissions targets and increase financing for countries most vulnerable to climate change. 
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has re-entered the Paris climate accord and is pushing for ambitious reductions of carbon emissions, while in July, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the heads of major development banks, including ADB and the World Bank, to devise plans to mobilize more capital to fight climate change and support emission cuts. 
A Treasury official told Reuters that the ADB's plans for coal plant retirement are among the types of projects that Yellen wants banks to pursue, adding the administration is ""interested in accelerating coal transitions"" to tackle the climate crisis. 
ASIA STEPS
As part of the group's proposal, the ADB has allocated around $1.7 million for feasibility studies covering Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam, to estimate the costs of early closure, which assets could be acquired, and engage with governments and other stakeholders.
""We would like to do the first (coal plant) acquisition in 2022,"" ADB's Saeed told Reuters, adding the mechanism could be scaled up and used as a template for other regions, if successful. It is already in discussions about extending this work to other countries in Asia, he added.
To retire 50% of a country's capacity early at $1 million-$1.8 million per megawatt suggests Indonesia would require a total facility of roughly $16-$29 billion, while Philippines would be about $5-$9 billion and Vietnam around $9-$17 billion, according to estimates by Prudential's Kanak.

One challenge that needs to be tackled is the potential risk of moral hazard, said Nick Robins, a London School of Economics sustainable finance professor. 
    ""There's a longstanding principle that the polluter should pay. We need to make absolutely sure that we are not paying the polluter, but rather paying for accelerated transition,"" he said.

974,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 05:41AM ET</span>",The $29 billion deal in 11 weeks: how Square bought Afterpay,"By Paulina Duran, Scott Murdoch and Krystal Hu
SYDNEY/HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jack Dorsey introduced the world to expressing itself in just 140 characters as the creator of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), and his payments company,  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ), also likes getting straight to the point.
Square's purchase of Australian buy now, pay later provider Afterpay Ltd for $29 billion in stock, the largest ever acquisition by Dorsey's firm, was consummated within three months, said four people with knowledge of the deal talks.
Such a short time is regarded as uncommon in the world of huge cross-border M&As, where armies of advisers can spend months negotiating key terms and poring over books and business plans to ensure there are no hidden skeletons.
As the business boomed in the past year, Afterpay fielded takeover interest from six potential buyers, including U.S. consumer banks, one of the sources said, but Square made more sense as the companies were already exploring services tie-ups.
Square wanted to provide a buy now, pay later feature for its popular Cash app, while Afterpay hoped to accelerate growth in the U.S. market, in competition with Affirm and Klarna. 
The deal talks for the largest buyout ever for an Australian firm started last year to explore a strategic partnership in response to growing competition from incumbents, and turned towards acquisition after key executives of the two firms met in Hawaii in May, three of the sources said.
The executives left the tropical island after a couple of days with the agreement that they needed to be combined, the sources said, adding that it took just 11 weeks from that point to finalise the transaction terms.
There were good reasons for the speed - banks and new entrants are aiming for a bigger slice of the buy now, pay later services that have boomed in the past year, as homebound consumers used them to borrow and spend online during the coronavirus pandemic.
The Australian firm's share price slumped 10% on July 14 on media reports that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was working on a buy now, pay later feature in coordination with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Such volatility put an emphasis on brevity. Shares in both companies reacted positively to the deal. 
On Monday, Afterpay closed in Sydney up 18.76%, while Square climbed 10.15% in New York, despite the prospect of shareholders being diluted by the new shares to pay for the profitless Australian company. Afterpay rose a further 11.3% on Tuesday.
Spokespersons at Square and Afterpay declined to comment on the deal background. The sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to talk to the media. 
'PROJECT POCKET'
Buy now, pay later firms lend shoppers instant funds, typically up to a few thousand dollars, which can be paid off interest-free. They generally make money from merchant commissions and late fees, rather than interest payments.
In this way, they sidestep the legal definition of credit and therefore credit laws.
That means such providers are not required to run background checks on new accounts, unlike credit card companies, and normally request just an applicant's name, address and birth date. Critics say that makes the system an easier fraud target.
Executives at Square and Afterpay shared a desire to expand access to customers globally and saw combining forces as the best way to take on competitors, both present and potential, in the business, the sources said.
Afterpay co-founder Nick Molnar first got to know Amrita Ahuja, chief financial officer at Square, years ago when he was living in the United States. Ahuja then introduced the Australian to Dorsey, said one of the sources. 
The deal talks, internally named ""Project Pocket"", picked up pace after Afterpay engaged Goldman to explore a U.S. listing in April, said another, which was soon followed by Square showing an interest in buying the company.
Soon after, Afterpay hired boutique Qatalyst Partners to evaluate the offer, with the option that if the deal fell through they would push ahead with the plan for the U.S. listing, said another person. 
Sydney-based boutique advisory Highbury Partners was also retained by Afterpay's board. 

The Hawaii trip finally led to the conclusion that each had what the other wanted.
For Square, it was Afterpay's expertise in buy now, pay later and its existing relationships with large merchants. And Afterpay envied Square's vast reach and popularity in the U.S. market.

Investing.com – Tencent stock (OTC:TCEHY) slumped by more than 6% in Hong Kong trading Tuesday after a state media report calling online gaming ‘opium for the mind’ stoked fears that the gaming sector may be next in the firing line of the Chinese authorities.
At one point, Tencent was down over 10%.  Xd Inc  (HK:2400) also fell, the share eroding by over 8% in Hong Kong. NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) traded almost 9% lower on Nasdaq premarket.
The selloff was triggered when the The Economic Information Daily,  an offshoot of the official news agency Xinhua, carried a report critical of the online gaming industry.
The article was taken down from the Daily's website within hours but still exists in the printed edition.
“Society has come to recognize the harm caused by online gaming and it is often referred to as ‘opium for the mind’ or ‘electronic drugs,’” the newspaper said. It said gaming addiction was spreading and harming children’s studies.
The report quoted a student as saying some schoolmates played Tencent’s Honor of Kings for as many as eight hours a day. Tencent said it would introduce stricter curbs on younger users.
Over the last few months, regulators in China have increased scrutiny of the country's tech and education giants. Steps have ranged from barring ride-hailing giant Didi (NYSE:DIDI) from the country's most popular app stores, to asking EdTech firms to go non-profit. "

The comments come after the mid-cap company, which currently has three other specialist divisions, spun off of its home improvement business Wickes and sold its plumbing and heating division earlier this year. 
Britain's construction industry recorded its fastest growth in 24 years in June, bolstered by a jump in demand for new homes and commercial property. 
The group now expects at least 310 million pounds ($430.87 million) in annual adjusted operating profit from continuing operations, up from at least 300 million pounds forecast in June.
'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC'
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts, however, said the outlook lift leaves a conservative second-half. Shares were trading about 2.6% lower. 
""I am cautiously optimistic around the outlook for the business,"" Chief Executive Nick Roberts said in a statement. 
Travis announced a 35 pence per share special dividend, which is part of the 325 million pounds proceeds from the sale of its plumbing and heating business, while rest of the consideration will be returned to shareholders through a share buyback plan later. 
It reported revenue of 2.30 billion pounds and adjusted operating profit of 164 million pounds for the six months ended June 30, compared with the pandemic-hit low base in 2020 of 1.67 billion pounds and 17 million pounds, respectively.

Williams said the company has ""largely managed"" supply chain disruptions arising from the pandemic and it has been able to offset the impacts of inflation.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 05:15AM ET</span>",StanChart reinstates payouts but income drop signals challenges ahead,"By Alun John and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -Standard Chartered PLC reported a higher than expected 57% jump in first-half profit and $350 million worth of shareholder payouts, but a fall in revenue showed the longer-term struggle ahead for the bank.
StanChart announced a $250 million share buyback and resumption of interim dividend payments worth 3 cents per share, or $94 million in total, joining other banks in rewarding shareholders after year-long regulatory curbs on payouts were removed last month.
However, its income fell 5% thanks to low interest rates, which the bank said it hopes are bottoming out, and due to declining revenue in its cash cow transaction banking business.
Having spent the early years since his appointment in 2015 fixing StanChart's battered balance sheet and slashing costs, Chief Executive Bill Winters has in recent years tried to restore growth. 
The results of those efforts have been mixed, as affirmed by the bank's latest report.
The Asia, Africa and the Middle East-focused bank is looking to capitalise on rising trade between those regions, as well as grow fee-based businesses such as wealth management to compensate for rock-bottom policy rates worldwide.
Pretax profit for StanChart rose to $2.55 billion in January-June from $1.63 billion in the same period last year, the London-headquartered bank said, slightly above the average of analysts' forecasts.
""We believe that we will soon be back on the same performance trajectory that we were on before the pandemic set us back,"" Winters said.
The bank hopes to grow income annually by about 5%-7% from 2022 onwards, he said, without providing a time-frame.
""Its significant position in the trade finance market gives the bank a degree of economic sensitivity that may not always be welcome, but is a useful tailwind when economies are reopening as they are at present,"" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
The bank's shares rose 1.2% in London, among the 10 best performers in the benchmark FTSE index, after its Hong Kong-listed stocks earlier fell 1%. 
FUTURE PAYOUTS
StanChart posted a record performance in its wealth division, with income up 23% to $1.2 billion, thanks to strong product sales through its new digital channels. 
Its profit was also boosted by a release of $67 million it had set aside to cover a potential increase in bad loans due to the pandemic, after taking a further $20 million charge in the first three months of the year.
However, StanChart released less than rival HSBC, which benefited from a larger presence in markets like Britain that have recovered faster than elsewhere thanks to high vaccination rates. 
StanChart's profit rebound was also less than those of Wall Street peers and British rivals HSBC and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), as income in its core cash management and trading businesses slumped.
Costs rose 8%, mainly due to higher pay for bankers as StanChart, in common with its rivals, boosted bonuses to try and retain key staff as banks' profits rebound.
“We are prepared to do buybacks but only if there are not more valuable ways to deploy that capital,” Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford told analysts, saying that the bank would consider bolt-on acquisitions in core markets.

The bank also set out three areas in which it said it will use its clout to help tackle global societal issues, namely climate change, women's rights and access to credit for small businesses, and ""giving more people the chance to participate in the world economy"".
StanChart said it will set long and near-term goals and that this would not be ""philanthropy"" but commercial investment.

LONDON (Reuters) -British fast food chain Greggs raised its full year outlook after a return to first-half profit and said it would use its rapidly expanding delivery service to grow sales in the evening, a segment of the market where it is currently underrepresented.
Greggs, which trades from 2,115 shops and is best known for its sausage rolls, steak bakes, vegan snacks and sweet treats, made an underlying pretax profit of 55.5 million pounds ($77.1 million) in the six months to July 3 versus a pretax loss of 64.5 million pounds in the same period last year.
While Greggs' shops were allowed to stay open during COVID-19 lockdowns, the crisis disrupted its business model, which relies on a high volume of customer visits.
However, the group saw a strong recovery in sales as pandemic restrictions eased.
Total first half sales were 546.2 million pounds, up from 300.6 million pounds in 2020.
Like-for-like sales compared to the same period in 2019, before the pandemic impacted trading, were down 9.2%.
But they have been positive since non-essential retail stores re-opened, driving increased customer numbers and are up 0.4% in the most recent four weeks to July 31.
Shares in Greggs were up 0.4% at 0758 GMT, extending 2021 gains to 56.5%.
Greggs' home delivery service in partnership with Just Eat has been rolled out to 837 outlets, with sales from the service representing 8.5% of company-managed shop sales in the first half.
CEO Roger Whiteside said he expected delivery would keep growing as more people view it as the most convenient channel.
""We're going to use the delivery channel as our primary way into trading in the evening,"" he told Reuters.
""Combining delivery with walk-in customers makes addressing that part of the day much more viable for us more quickly.""
Whiteside said expanding delivery means more shop capacity will be needed.
Greggs sees scope for at least 3,000 UK shops. It expects around 100 net openings in 2021, creating 500 new jobs in the second half.
The group now expects full-year profit ""slightly ahead"" of its previous expectations. Prior to Tuesday's update analysts' average forecast was profit of 130 million pounds versus a 13.7 million pound loss in 2020.

The group is also paying an interim dividend of 15 pence, its first payment since 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Airlines (JAL) on Tuesday posted a first-quarter operating loss of 82.65 billion yen ($756.87 million), an improvement from a year earlier, as pandemic-related cost cuts took effect and travel demand rose from a very low base. 
Japan's second-biggest airline's result for the three months ended June 30 was worse than an estimate of a 73.5 billion yen loss from five analysts polled by Refinitiv but narrower than the 131 billion yen operating loss in the same quarter last year.
JAL did not provide a full-year earnings forecast, saying uncertainty made prediction too difficult. The carrier could post an annual operating loss of 108.6 billion, according to the average of 10 analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
The Japanese airline, like other carriers, has been burning through cash reserves to keep jets and workers it will need when travel demand rebounds. 
JAL expects its cash burn rate to fall to around 5 billion yen a month in the second quarter from 10 to 15 billion yen a month in the first quarter, Senior Managing Executive Officer Hideki Kikuyuma told reporters.
""As refunds have been decreasing since around June, cash burn is falling,"" he said. ""Depending on the return of domestic passenger demand, we are hopeful that operating cash flow will turn positive in September or so.""
Passenger numbers for domestic flights in the April-June quarter more than doubled from the previous year, but were less than a third of pre-pandemic levels as Japan grapples with record levels of COVID-19 cases. 
International traffic quadrupled from last year, but passenger numbers totalled only 6.2% of the same quarter two years ago.
One bright spot for the airline has been strong demand for cargo, though JAL does not operate dedicated freighter planes like rival ANA Holdings Inc. 
To adapt to what it expects will be a long-term dip in business travel, JAL is expanding budget units that will focus on tourism demand in Asia.

It is also retiring 26 of its older 777 widebodies and adding new Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A350 jets.

LONDON (Reuters) -BMW raised its 2021 profit forecast on Tuesday after strong quarterly results, but said the global semiconductor chip shortage and rising raw materials prices would hurt its performance in the second half of the year.
BMW has been less affected by the chip shortage than some of its peers which has been attributed to its strong relations with its suppliers.
""We continue to regard BMW as one of the best operators in the autos industry,"" Bernstein analyst Arndt Ellinghorst wrote in a client note on the results. ""It has been far less volatile than pretty much all its global peers and has hardly ever lost money in any given quarter.""
German rivals Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) have both warned the chip shortage would dent their results in the second half, and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) has said the crisis could drag on into 2022.
BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse flagged similar pressures later this year. 
""In light of a number of prevailing risks, including raw materials prices and a shortage of semiconductors, the second six-month period is likely to be more volatile for the BMW Group,"" Zipse said in a statement. 
Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter said in a statement that BMW was able to offset the challenges of the chip shortage through ""sheer hard work"" but added ""the longer the supply bottlenecks last, the more tense the situation is likely to become."" [L8N2PA179]
Like other major carmakers, BMW is working toward the electrification of its model range, with two new all-electric models coming later this year.
As part of a climate plan issued last month that effectively bans fossil-fuel cars from 2035, the European Commission proposed spending by EU member states on charging infrastructure on highways to overcome consumer anxiety about electric vehicle driving range.
But BMW said on Tuesday that the EU's charging plans are ""not ambitious enough"".
""We must not allow charging infrastructure to be the bottleneck that decides whether customers buy an electric vehicle or not,"" Zipse said on a call with journalists. ""We need a stronger commitment to this.""
BMW reported a better-than-expected second-quarter profit after a loss a year earlier when the German luxury carmaker was pummelled by the coronavirus pandemic. 
BMW's sales jumped nearly 45%, while rising almost 75% in Europe and 88% in the United States. 
Sales in China, which drove the carmaker back to profitability in the second half of 2020 after pandemic-related production shutdowns, were up nearly 12%.
BMW reported a quarterly net profit of 4.8 billion euros ($5.7 billion), more than double the 2.2 billion euro forecast by analysts, Refinitiv Eikon data showed, and rebounding from a 212 million euro loss a year earlier.
The results also received a 1 billion boost after BMW had to set aside less money than initially feared for expected European antitrust fines for alleged collusion with rivals.

The carmaker said it now expects a full-year operating margin for the automotive segment at the upper end of its forecasted range of 7% to 9%.

MILAN (Reuters) - Generali (MI:GASI) on Tuesday said it was on track to meet full-year targets after Italy's top insurer reported a good performance across all business sectors to slightly beat first-half expectations.
Operating profit rose 10.4% to 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) versus the 2.95 billion expected by analysts in a poll provided by the insurer.
Its solvency ratio, a key measure of financial strength for insurers, rose to 231% from 224% but was short of the 235% expects by analysts.
It was still at 231% at the end of July, head of finance Cristiano Borean said. 
Generali said in a statement it would successfully complete its current strategic plan at the end of 2021 and CEO Philippe Donnet would unveil a new plan on Dec. 15.
The Trieste-based insurer, one of Italy's most prized financial assets, is due to appoint a new board next spring and speculation has mounted over Donnet's future due to tensions among top shareholders.
Milanese merchant bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) is the biggest investor in Generali, followed by businessmen Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio.
Over the past two years, first Del Vecchio and then Caltagirone have also emerged as leading shareholders of Mediobanca.
In a first public sign of discontent over the balance of power among shareholders, Caltagirone in April snubbed the insurer's annual general meeting.
Asked on a media call about reported criticism from Caltagirone and Del Vecchio, Donnet said he would not comment on rumours or speak about boardroom discussions.
""I am focused on doing my job in the interest of all shareholders and preparing the new strategic plan.""
In a sign of support for Donnet's performance, Generali said its board was pleased with the results achieved ""in a particularly challenging environment"". 

The insurer said its board would start preparatory work to compile a list of candidates and would discuss the matter on Sept. 27.

Jiangsu Jingdong Cargo Airlines, with registered capital of 600 million yuan ($92.83 million), has obtained preliminary regulatory approvals to launch a new carrier, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a notice. 
Suqian Jindong Zhanrui Enterprise Management, controlled by the JD.com founder Richard Liu, will contribute 75% of the founding capital while Airport Group in Nantong, a city in Jiangsu, will supply the rest, according to CAAC. 
The airline is planning to use Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 planes for its fleet, the CAAC added. 
JD.com declined to comment beyond the CAAC statement.
JD Logistics, the logistics offshoot of JD.com, raised $3.16 billion in its initial public offering in May, the second largest IPO in Hong Kong in 2021.
The setup of a new cargo airline comes as JD.com's online shopping rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding LTd has been expanding its fleet. YTO Cargo Airlines, owned by Alibaba-backed YTO Express, is introducing freighters converted from 767 and 777 planes.

Boeing, which has been struggling in China with sales of passenger planes due to trade tensions and the grounding of its 737 MAX, dominates the global freighter market. Air freight rates have skyrocketed, driven in part by a pandemic-induced expansion of online shopping.

The corporate earnings season remained in full flow in Europe Tuesday, with the banking sector leading the way. 
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) stock climbed 3% as the French lender, the country’s third largest, raised its forecast for the full year after it swung back to profit in the second quarter. The results were helped by a rebound in its French retail banking business. 
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) stock rose 0.4% after the U.K.-based bank posted a better-than-expected 57% jump in its first-half pretax profit while also announcing a $250 million share buyback and resuming interim dividend payments.
Elsewhere, BP (NYSE:BP) stock climbed 3.3% after the U.K. oil major followed its main rivals by increasing its dividend and boosting its share buybacks after higher crude prices allowed it to return to profit too. 
Stellantis (PA:STLA) stock rose 4.1% after the carmaker raised its full-year operating profit target after strong first-half results, while  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) stock rose 0.3% after the French drugmaker confirmed it had made a $3.2 billion offer to buy U.S. biotech company Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO) to strengthen its capability in messenger RNA, the technology underlying the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines.

In Asia earlier Tuesday, the stock of gaming and social media giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) slumped as much as 10% as investors fretted that Chinese authorities could now turn their regulatory focus on the gaming sector in wake of Beijing’s recent clampdown on the education and ride-hailing sectors.
In economic news, the main focus will be on the June Eurozone PPI release, with the annual figure expected to rise further from the 9.6% level seen in May.

(Reuters) - Foreigners dumped Asian equities in July on mounting concerns over the Delta variant of the coronavirus, while China's crackdown on its tech companies also hit sentiment.
Last month, cross-border investors sold equities worth a combined net total of $10.6 billion in South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India, data from stock exchanges showed. That compares with an outflow of just $725 million in June.
""Asian stock market outflows may be attributed to worsening pandemic situations across the region as well as a hawkish-biased shift by the Fed during June's FOMC meeting,"" Margaret Yang, a strategist at DailyFX said.
The region's stocks were hit heavily last month after Beijing banned for-profit tutoring on core school subjects, following crackdowns earlier this year on the tech sector. 
Manishi Raychaudhuri, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), said the rapid changes in Chinese regulations affecting sectors such as e-commerce, food delivery and education have dampened sentiment in Hong Kong and China, and led to outflows from Asia as a whole. 
Taiwan and South Korean equities led the selling in the region, facing outflows of over $4 billion each. 
South Korea saw a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases last month, hit by the more contagious Delta variant.
India, Thailand and Philippine equities also faced outflows worth $1.51 billion, $544 million and $183 million, respectively.
However, foreigners purchased Vietnamese equities worth a net $231 million, while Indonesian equities also had some meagre inflows.
Asian stocks have recouped some of their recent losses this week, helped by optimism over earnings and progress on an U.S. infrastructure bill.

""There may potentially be some fund inflows back into Asia equities as global sentiments take on a more risk-on approach with optimism over recent US infrastructure plan,"" said Jun Rong Yeap, a Singapore-based market strategist at IG.

988,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 02:36AM ET</span>",BP Follows Big Oil Peers by Increasing Buybacks and Dividend,"(Bloomberg) --
BP (NYSE:BP) Plc followed its Big Oil peers by increasing dividends and share buybacks as higher crude prices boosted profit.
The oil majors -- with the notable exception of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). -- are raising returns as they express confidence that the worst of the slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic is over. Their goal is to woo investors who are becoming increasingly wary about the future of the fossil fuels in a changing climate.
BP posted “another quarter of strong performance while investing for the future in a disciplined way,” Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said in a statement on Tuesday. “We are increasing our resilient dividend by 4% per ordinary share, and in addition we are commencing a buyback of $1.4 billion from first half surplus cash flow.”
Both are significant pledges that go further than the distributions policy outlined earlier this year. The turnaround reflects the impact of higher energy prices, but also demands from shareholders, who weren’t happy in early 2021 with BP’s plans.
If oil averages about $60 a barrel, BP expects to be able to continue increasing its dividend by about 4% annually and repurchase $1 billion of shares each quarter until 2025, Looney said.
“This shows we continue to perform while transforming BP -- generating value for our shareholders today while we transition the company for the future,” Looney said.
The London-based company’s second-quarter adjusted net income was $2.8 billion, compared with a loss of $6.68 billion a year earlier, according to the statement. That was above the average estimate of $2.13 billion in a Bloomberg poll of 19 analysts.
Higher shareholder returns show the oil majors’ confidence that higher oil and gas prices are here to stay. BP increased its Brent crude price assumptions to 2030 to reflect expected supply constraints, resulting in the reversal of a previous pre-tax net impairment of $3 billion.
Having achieved its net debt target of $35 billion in the first quarter, BP’s net liabilities dropped further in the period to $32.71 billion, thanks to the sale of assets. The firm has a goal of reaching $25 billion of divestments by 2025 to fund the expansion of its low-carbon business.

989,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 02:10AM ET</span>",Western Australia takes step-up in battery chemicals production,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Western Australia is preparing to take a bigger slice of the booming global battery market, forecast to grow to $150 billion by 2030, as it moves beyond mining lithium and nickel into chemical processing.
Three big battery chemicals plants are set to come on line in coming months, while Germany's BASF is part of a pilot project with a state government research body to build a precursor chemical plant to blend the feeds used by battery makers.
As investors and electric vehicle makers look for supply chains away from dominant producer China, Australia believes it can compete on price and is banking on what it says are its solid credentials in responsible production.
""It's the chemical steps that are attractive here in Australia,"" state mining minister Bill Johnston told Reuters, adding end users could be confident that processing was done to high environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards.
""The next step is to talk to international investors to move further down into chemical processing, either a precursor chemical plant or a cathode active material plant. We believe that we have a strong business case for investment.""
Cathode active materials give batteries different characteristics depending on the types and combinations of metals used, such as lithium, nickel and cobalt.
Electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said in June it expects to spend more than $1 billion a year on battery raw materials from Australia given the country's reliable mining industry and responsible production practices. It signed a deal in July to take nickel from BHP Group (NYSE:BHP). 
MAJOR PRODUCER
Australia produces half the world's lithium and is a significant nickel and copper supplier, while the world's global battery market is forecast to grow to $133-$151 billion by 2030 from $36 billion in 2020, according to a June Accenture (NYSE:ACN) report. 
Australia does not yet produce battery chemicals, sending its raw materials to customers in Asia.
However, lithium hydroxide plants built by China's Tianqi Lithium and U.S.-based  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp will open later this year, along with a BHP nickel sulphate plant. 
The plant involving BASF is targeted for commissioning at the end of 2021 and the project will run until 2025, a spokesperson for the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre said.
BASF said in a statement to Reuters it was committed to the sustainability of the battery value chain, and noted success requires ""a stable legal and political framework"" as well as joint efforts across industry.
By integrating chemicals production closer to the raw materials, companies building plants can cut their freight costs by up to 30% and boost margins, according to Accenture.  
For Australia, it estimated diversified battery industries could contribute $7.4 billion a year to the economy and support nearly 35,000 jobs.
ESG CONCERN
Another string in Western Australia's ESG bow is the move by many big miners to shift to renewable energy in their operations, but the state may still face some headwinds as it touts its ESG credentials.
The legal destruction of culturally sacred rock shelters last year by Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) has put pressure on the state government to meet investor expectations when it releases a draft Aboriginal heritage bill due in coming months.
""ESG is a spectrum of sustainability issues,"" said Alison George of Regnan, the responsible investment arm of global investment manager Pendal Group which has around $92 billion under management.

""You might look at cultural heritage practices and Indigenous relations and ask whether WA is willing to keep ratcheting up its standards to meet escalating expectations,"" she said.
""We are in a situation where trust has been damaged and therefore heightened efforts are required.""

Investing.com -- European stock markets are expected to open in a mixed fashion Tuesday, with investors balancing strong corporate banking results with concerns about a further Chinese regulatory clampdown.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
Helping sentiment in the European equity markets Tuesday were some strong results in the banking sector. 
French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), the country’s third-largest lender, raised its forecast for the full year after it swung back to a profit in the second quarter, helped by a rebound in its French retail banking business. 
Additionally, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) posted a better-than-expected 57% jump in its first-half pretax profit while also announcing a $250 million share buyback and resumed interim dividend payments, as it benefited from an economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Elsewhere, BMW (DE:BMWG) posted a better-than-expected second-quarter net profit versus a loss in the same period in 2020 when the German luxury carmaker was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
 Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) will also be in the spotlight after the French drugmaker confirmed it had made a $3.2 billion offer to buy U.S. biotech company Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO).
In Asia earlier Tuesday, the stock of gaming and social media giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) slumped as much as 10% as investors fretted that Chinese authorities could now turn their regulatory focus on the gaming sector in wake of Beijing’s recent clampdown on the education and ride-hailing sectors.
This follows an article in the Chinese state media branding online gaming a type of “opium”, while calling for restrictions on the industry in order to prevent addiction, particularly in younger people.
In economic news, the main focus will be on the June Eurozone PPI release, with the annual figure expected to rise further from the 9.6% level seen in May.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower as concerns over slowing factory activity in both the U.S. and China, the two biggest consumers of crude in the world, coupled with mounting Covid worries weighed on sentiment.
Of interest later in the session will be the latest forecasts of U.S. crude and product inventories for last week from the American Petroleum Institute.
At 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $71.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $72.83.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,813.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.18752037.

In a statement that confirmed an exclusive report by Reuters, Sanofi said it would acquire all outstanding shares of Translate Bio for $38.00 per share in cash, representing a total equity value of about $3.2 billion for Translate Bio.

DUBAI(Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) and other Gulf oil producers are following in the footsteps of Abu Dhabi with plans to raise tens of billions of dollars through sales of stakes in energy assets, capitalising on a rebound in crude prices to attract foreign investors.
The moves, in a region traditionally possessive of its refineries, power plants and pipelines, highlight the pressure on petrostates to raise funds to diversify their sources of revenue and to bolster national finances hit by a recent slump in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic.
After selling a significant minority stake in its oil pipelines to foreign investors for $12.4 billion in June, Saudi Aramco is weighing selling both downstream and upstream assets, two people familiar with the matter said.
Aramco is looking to sell its gas pipelines under a leaseback arrangement, and could offer stakes in refineries, power plants, and potentially export terminals in the future, the people said.
Stakes in upstream projects such as hydrogen could also be offered to strategic investors, one of the sources said.
Smaller producers Oman and Bahrain are also contemplating similar asset sales, other sources said.
""All of the oil producers are looking to recycle capital that they have tied up in infrastructure assets and deploy that for other things,"" said a senior executive at an energy-focused investment company, who asked not to be named.
""Private investors find these assets attractive.""
Saudi Aramco declined to comment.
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) was the first regional oil major to seek outside investment, forming partnerships in both strategic and non-core assets to raise over $30 billion over the past four years.
ADNOC is now preparing to list its drilling business, which in 2018 had an enterprise value of about $11 billion, and would be the second such IPO of its units after its fuel distribution arm, ADNOC Distribution, was listed in 2017.
ADNOC has made attracting foreign investors a key element of the upcoming IPO, according to sources familiar with the deal, tying in with a national effort to boost the Abu Dhabi stock market.
Conventional energy investments remain popular despite the transition away from fossil fuels. Assets such as pipelines and power plants provide long-term steady returns in a low interest rate environment.
ADNOC and Aramco have not specified what they would spend the proceeds of the stake sales on. Both are looking to invest in clean energy projects. Aramco also needs to secure minority shareholders their share of the company's proposed $75 billion of annual dividends in the five years since a 2019 IPO.
ADNOC declined to comment about its future plans. The company reiterated that proceeds from transactions between 2017 and 2020 were reinvested in its core business and strategic growth projects.
A BENCHMARK FOR ASSETS
Deals for Gulf energy assets are expected to gather pace and draw more interest as oil prices, supported by output cuts made by OPEC and other oil producers, hover above $70 a barrel. Oil has gained more than 40% since the start of the year.
Oman state energy company OQ is weighing the possible sale of its drilling business, Abraj Energy Services, and has also hired advisors for the sale of its entire 12% stake in Portuguese power grid operator Ren, sources have previously told Reuters.
Bahrain's Nogaholding, which manages the government's portfolio in oil and gas assets, is in the process of a ""full review of the company’s existing business and strategic plans"", a spokesperson told Reuters.
The slew of deals coming from the UAE and Saudi Arabia are also creating a benchmark for assets of other regional players, according to a source that advised one investor.
The source said potential investors are looking to make a double-digit return on investments in energy infrastructure assets because they have to lock in their capital for 25 years.
However, smaller countries with lower sovereign ratings and under pressure for fiscal adjustment may have to pay up in order to attract overseas investors.

""The Omanis may juice up the deals by absorbing some of the risks themselves to attract investors,"" the source said.
Oman's OQ did not respond to a request for comment.

Leo's lawsuit disclosed in a securities filing late on Monday comes after Huaibei Mining Holdings said last week its construction unit is suing Evergrande over an overdue 400 million yuan in fees.
And Langfang Development said last week a court has ordered Evergrande's shares in the company be frozen for three years following a ruling on a lawsuit between Evergrande and an investment company.
Worries over the financial health of China's No.2 developer intensified after it said in June it did not pay some commercial paper on time, and on news last month that a court froze a $20 million bank deposit held by the developer on the request of Guangfa Bank. 
Separately, Lets Holding, a construction R&D company, said in a securities filing at the weekend it does not rule out taking legal means to resolve Evergrande's overdue commercial paper of 33 million yuan.
Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filings by Leo Group and Lets Holding. 
Rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgraded Evergrande's corporate family rating (CFR) by two notches on Monday to Caa1 from B2, and the senior unsecured ratings to Caa2 from B3, following similar action from S&P and Fitch earlier. 
The downgrades reflect the firm's heightened refinancing risk over the coming 12-18 months given its weakened funding access and liquidity position, Moody's said.

Shares of Evergrande dropped as much as 4.9% on Tuesday morning in Hong Kong, versus a 1.1% decline in the broader market.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian casino operator Crown Resorts Ltd warned on Tuesday its staff and shareholders would suffer if its main operating licence is cancelled over money laundering allegations.
Crown's lawyer told a government-appointed commission of inquiry that evidence of wrongdoing at the company's casino in Melbourne left commissioners open to conclude that Crown was ""not a presently suitable person to hold the casino licence"".
But cancelling the licence or forcing a sale or break-up would have negative consequences for the tourism industry and Crown's ""mum and dad"" shareholders, lawyer Michael Borsky said.
""There would, on any view, be enormous disruption and possible financial hardship for so many, when so many are already living under great uncertainty and hardship as a result of the pandemic,"" he said.
Crown, 37%-owned by billionaire founder James Packer, has been embroiled in legal battles and scandal since allegations of money laundering at its Melbourne casino emerged in 2019. The company has three casinos in Australia, but its Melbourne property brings in three quarters of its profit. 
Government-appointed lawyers at the Melbourne inquiry have argued Crown should be de-licenced for its failure to repair a culture that turned a blind eye to money laundering and organised crime, and for letting Packer act as a shadow-director.
A separate inquiry into its new A$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) resort in Sydney found Crown unsuitable for a licence in New South Wales state, while another inquiry into a third casino, in Perth, Western Australia, is underway.
Borsky invoked the company's standing as the state of Victoria's biggest single-site employer, with 11,500 staff, and said there was no guarantee a new owner ""would seamlessly take on the full workforce without disruption or prejudice"".
Shareholders ""must and will take pain"" from any penalties related to the Melbourne inquiry, he said. But the company had 46,000 minor investors, and cancellation of Crown's licence ""would impose great financial losses"".
Earlier on Tuesday, Crown said the CEO of its Melbourne casino was stepping down.

The Melbourne inquiry continues.

996,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 11:05PM ET</span>","Qantas idles 2,500 more staff as COVID-19 cuts domestic flights","(Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd is temporarily idling about 2,500 employees without pay for at least two months in a bid to cope with fresh COVID-19 restrictions in Australia slashing domestic travel demand.
The decision will directly impact domestic pilots, cabin crew and airport workers, mostly in New South Wales, the airline said on Tuesday, adding that no job losses were expected from the move.
Qantas said it had gone from operating almost 100% of its pre-COVID domestic flying capacity in May to less than 40% in July due to lockdowns meant to curb the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus. 
The country's most populous city, Sydney, has been hit particularly hard by infections and will remain in lockdown for at least another three-and-a-half weeks amid a drive to get the population vaccinated against COVID-19 as quickly as possible.
""Based on current case numbers it is reasonable to assume that Sydney borders will be closed for at least another two months,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce told reporters. 
The affected domestic employees, who will join 6,000 colleagues furloughed in its international division due to border closures, will receive government-backed support payments of A$750 ($552.15) a week.
Qantas has around 22,000 employees in all. 
The airline said it is aiming for domestic flying levels to improve to around 50%-60% of normal levels within a few weeks as some states reopen borders after exiting lockdowns that contained small outbreaks. 
Qantas will not hibernate any of its domestic planes because it wants to be able to ramp up quickly as demand returns, with a goal of topping 100% of pre-COVID capacity by Christmas, Joyce said.
Its international fleet has been grounded since March 2020. The airline currently has many international flights on sale from late December, but Joyce said the status of those plans would depend on Australia's vaccination rate.
The government set a target last week for 80% of adults to be fully vaccinated for a calibrated reopening of its international borders. Only around 18% are fully vaccinated currently.

Qantas shares were down 1.4% in early afternoon trade, underperforming a 0.3% drop in the broader stock market.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Tuesday morning, as the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in the region’s key markets soured risk sentiment.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.91% by 10:47 PM ET (2:47 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day said the Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.1% year-on-year in July, while the Tokyo CPI contracted 0.1% year-on-year. Tokyo's CPI excluding food and energy grew 0.2% month-on-month in July.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.14%. with the country’s CPI growing a better-than-expected 2.6% year-on-year in July. The Bank of Korea also released the minutes from its latest Financial Stability Board meeting.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.26%. Australian building approvals contracted 6.7% month-on-month in June, while private house approvals fell 11.8% in the same month.

The Reserve Bank of Australia will hand down its policy decision for August later in the day, with the Bank of England following on Thursday and the Reserve Bank of India on the following day.
The global spread of COVID-19, and its Delta variant, continues to be of concern to investors. China has seen cases spread to inland cities from the coast, with restrictive measures re-implemented to curb the latest outbreak. Investors also continue to monitor shares in China and Hong Kong, as China continues to tighten regulation in sectors including technology and private education.
""It's a challenging time for Asian equities with the uncertainty that has been created by the regulatory measures... there was some handholding from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) last week to limit the spread of the contagion and counter the popular thinking of which sector is next. That worked for a few days but then we saw the flows start to reverse again,” BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management head of Asian equities Zhikai Chen told Reuters.
Meanwhile, U.S. data released on Monday that was robust but softer also soured investor sentiment.

Meanwhile, the debate on when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin asset tapering and hike interest rates continues. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he could back an asset tapering announcement by September 2021 should the next two monthly U.S. employment data show continued gains.
Investors now look to the latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, due on Friday, to gauge the labor market’s recovery. But for some, it was a matter of priorities.

By Echo Wang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 Index closed slightly lower on Monday after erasing early gains as worries about the Delta variant of the coronavirus and a slowing U.S. economy overshadowed optimism around more fiscal stimulus and a strong second-quarter earnings season.
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said on CNBC late in the session that the Fed could start to reduce its support for the economy by October if the next two monthly jobs reports each show employment rising by 800,000 to 1 million, as he expects. 
He also suggested the Fed could announce in September it would start to reduce its monthly bond purchases, which could lift yields again - not the best news for the stock market. 
Data earlier in the day showed that although U.S. manufacturing grew in July, its pace slowed for a second straight month as spending rotated back to services from goods, and shortages of raw materials persisted. 
The softer-than-expected data also sent U.S. bond yields to their lowest since July 20 and knocked the blue-chip Dow off an intra-day record high hit in early trading.
“An issue for the market... is the rise of the growth scare"", said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank, ""Whether it's more restrictions in China with infections rising in 14 provinces now, or questions about how far is the U.S. going to have to go with mask mandates.”

(Reuters) - Memory chip maker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) on Monday said it would shift how it returns cash to shareholders, buying up more shares when prices are low, fewer when prices are high and instituting a dividend for the first time.
Micron makes DRAM and NAND memory chips, which are needed for nearly all computing systems and whose price can fluctuate widely based on global supply and demand. This can cause swings in profits - and share prices - at most memory makers.
Micron on Monday said it would start adjusting its previously regular share repurchases - which have returned about $4 billion in cash to shareholders since 2018 - to match those cycles, holding back when prices are high so that it can retire more shares for each dollar spent.
""We're changing our buyback strategy to be more opportunistic,"" Micron Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said during a conference call announcing the news.
Micron on Monday also declared an initial quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, payable in cash on Oct. 18.
Capital return programs can be tough for memory companies to manage during the industry's boom-and-bust cycles.
Micron's largest two competitors for memory chips - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and SK Hynix Inc - both pay dividends to shareholders. Hynix cut its dividend in 2019 when profits plummeted at the bottom of an industry cycle.

Micron's changes to its capital return program come as the company is preparing to ramp up spending for a new generation of chips.
Micron in June said its capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 would rise above $9.5 billion, partly driven by pre-payments as it starts to acquire extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines from Dutch maker ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) NV. The machines are necessary for making the most cutting-edge chips but can cost more than $100 million each.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China's government quietly issued new procurement guidelines in May that require up to 100% local content on hundreds of items including X-ray machines and magnetic resonance imaging equipment, erecting fresh barriers for foreign suppliers, three U.S.-based sources told Reuters.
Document 551 was issued on May 14 by the Chinese Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), with the title, ""Auditing guidelines for government procurement of imported products,"" said one former U.S. government official, who obtained a copy of the previously unreported 70-page catalog and read portions to Reuters, but requested anonymity.
The former official said that when China joined the World Trade Organization, it agreed not to issue such internal documents. The document also violated the spirit of the January 2020 Phase One trade deal with the United States, the former official said. ""They need to reduce barriers, not create new ones.""
Sent to Chinese hospitals, companies and other state-owned buyers, the document sets local content requirements of 25% to 100% for 315 items. They include medical equipment, ground-based radar equipment, testing machinery, optical instruments; items used for animal husbandry; seismic instruments, and marine, geological and geophysical equipment, the former official said.
The document has not been publicly released by Beijing.
China's Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to queries about it. 
Some U.S. lawmakers and industry officials are increasingly concerned about Beijing's transparency on trade issues.
The new guidelines affect a wide range of goods, including medical devices, which Beijing agreed to buy more of under the terms of the Phase 1 trade deal. For example, magnetic resonance imaging equipment - a key export for U.S. companies in the past - would face a 100% local content requirements under the new guidelines, the former official said.
U.S. trade experts said China's local content rules differed from planned increases in U.S. ""Buy American"" thresholds because they were not publicly released, and affect far greater volumes of medical equipment and other goods since China's state-owned enterprises include hospitals and other entities.
BILLIONS IN SALES AT STAKE 
China imported some $124 billion in goods from the United States in 2020, much of which was purchased by vast state-owned and government-associated companies that control the education, health, transportation, agriculture and energy sectors. 
U.S. medical device exports, made by companies including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), GE and Abbott totaled $47.5 billion in 2018, with exports to China valued at $4.5 billion, according to Fitch Solutions data. Chinese imports of such goods fell during the U.S.-China trade war in 2018 and 2019, but rose again after the Phase 1 trade accord was inked. 
Doug Barry, spokesman for the U.S. China Business Council, said his group has heard about the document, but has not seen a copy. The group's members who operate in China are reporting new problems in competing for and winning bids there, including areas such as testing equipment and transportation, he said.
The council is urging President Joe Biden's administration to complete its review of U.S.-China trade policies and raise its concerns when Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet in October.
Biden's predecessor Donald Trump, as part of his sometimes contentious China trade policy, was a strong advocate of ""Buy American"" and ""America first."" 
Biden signed a ""Buy American"" executive order during his first week in office in January aimed at harnessing the vast buying power of the federal government to boost American manufacturing, and last week unveiled new rules about U.S. content levels in goods procured by the government.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office, which is reviewing U.S.-China trade policies, declined to comment on the Chinese document or whether it violates the U.S.-China trade deal.
USTR spokesman Adam Hodge also declined to give any timetable for when USTR will conclude its review.
One congressional staffer, who was briefed on the document by people who have seen it, said it raised many questions, including whether foreign-owned entities producing goods in China for the Chinese market would meet the new local content criteria.
The non-public nature of the guidelines also meant the Chinese government could play down their importance, the staffer said. ""It isn’t posted; it’s not public. It’s being circulated through companies and associations and other groups,” the staffer said. “By not releasing it publicly, the PRC could deny it and say it’s just guidance."" 

New import restrictions could also make it difficult for China to make up lost ground in meeting its commitment to buy an additional $200 billion in U.S. goods and services under the U.S.-China trade deal, compared to 2017 levels. 
With three-fourths of the deal now complete, China is on pace to buy just over 60% of the goods needed to reach its target, according to Chad Bown, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Popular networking companies Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper (JNPR) are among companies we think are well-positioned to benefit from the industry tailwinds. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now. Read on.Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in San Jose, Calif., and Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) in Sunnyvale, Calif., are prominent players in the U.S. communication and networking industry. CSCO offers Internet Protocol (IP) based networking products and services, while JNPR provides products and services for high-performance networks.
Because people may not resume working from company premises anytime soon, thanks to the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic with the spread of the Delta variant, the demand for networking solutions should remain high. Furthermore, the adoption of a hybrid working structure by several organizations as a long-term solution, and continued digital transformation, should drive the long-term growth of the networking industry. 
The global Network-as-a-Service market is expected to grow at a 33.1% CAGR to hit $45.03 billion by 2026. Consequently, both CSCO and JNPR should see increasing demand for their products and services.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 05:20PM ET</span>","Stocks reverse to red, oil slips amid Delta variant anxiety","By Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON (Reuters) -U.S. stocks reversed course on Monday to finish slightly lower, echoing a decline in oil and Treasury prices, as economic worries related to the Delta variant of the coronavirus outweighed optimism about infrastructure spending and corporate earnings.
Stocks initially cheered the announcement on Sunday by U.S. senators of around $1 trillion in proposed infrastructure stimulus. A rebound in corporate profits also bolstered the case for owning stocks, even as markets stand near records and economic growth is expected to slow.
Those factors helped push the S&P 500 index to a near all-time high on Monday morning, but the benchmark basket ultimately retreated to lose 8.1 points, or 0.18%, to 4,387.16
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 97.31 points, or 0.28%, to 34,838.16, and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.39 points, or 0.06%, to 14,681.07.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, gained 0.37%.
""The Delta variant still represents the most immediate threat to the outlook,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) market strategists wrote in a note on Monday. 
But the bank's outlook cited a surprise decline in British and European COVID-19 cases and positive second quarter economic data from the United States and Europe: ""Constructive news last week on Delta and growth trims downside risks.""
The risks were not lost on other markets, including in energy. Oil prices tumbled about 3% on Monday as weak economic data from China and the U.S., the world's top oil consumers, and higher crude output from OPEC producers stoked fears of weakness in oil demand and oversupply.
Brent settled at $72.89 a barrel, down 3.3% on the day, while U.S. crude fell 3.6% to $71.26 per barrel and .
U.S. manufacturing continued to grow in July, though the pace slowed for the second straight month as spending rotates back to services from goods and shortages of raw materials persist.
Factories around the world are suffering from supply bottlenecks, which sent prices skyrocketing in July, while a new wave of coronavirus infections in Asia demonstrated the fragile nature of the global recovery.
Treasuries Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 18/32 in price to yield 1.1806%, but were still down from 1.239% late on Friday and continuing a multi-month decline.
Negatively interpreting lower Treasury yields, however, could be a mistake, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Guneet Dhingra.
""Investors are fitting a narrative of excessive pessimism to lower yields,"" Dhingra wrote in a note on Sunday, noting low hospitalizations in Britain from the Delta variant, ""suggesting overstated downside risks from COVID-19."" 
The dollar fell back toward the one-month lows hit last week when it became clear the Fed was in no hurry to tighten policy. 

As of late Monday afternoon, the dollar index fell 0.028%, with the euro down 0.02% to $1.1868.
Spot gold dropped 0.1% to $1,812.70 an ounce as an uptick in risk appetite took some shine off the safe-haven metal. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.3% at $1,822.20.

Analysts expect this upswing to continue in the coming months. Therefore, we think established big box stores operators Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Costco Wholesale (COST),  Target  (TGT), and Big Lots (NYSE:BIG) should witness good revenue growth in the near term. Read on.The retail industry rearranged its operations to focus mainly on online platforms and delivery networks amid social distancing mandates last year. However, with the vaccination rollout in full swing, big box stores have lately been witnessing rising foot traffic. Retail sales have accelerated significantly on pent-up demand for discretionary products thanks to rising consumer spending. The demand from online and physical outlets has driven a 17.6% year-over-year increase in retail sales in the first five months of 2021, surpassing original forecasts.
Consequently, the National Retail Foundation (NRF) has upgraded its 2021 retail sales forecast and expects personal consumption expenditures to grow 7.5% year-over-year rather than 4.5% predicted earlier. NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said, “We are seeing clear signs of a strong and resilient economy.”
As economic activities continue to build up steam, the shares of the big box store operators are expected to deliver significant returns through the remainder of 2021. As a result, we believe the shares of leaders in this space, Walmart Inc. (WMT), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), and Big Lots, Inc. (BIG), should be attractive bets now.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 04:26PM ET</span>",China clampdown concerns spurred record ADR trading,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Market turbulence caused by Beijing's clampdowns on its tech, education and property sectors drove trading in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks to a record high in dollar terms last month, data shows.
The concerns triggered the biggest monthly fall in China-linked American Depository Receipts or ADRs, as they are known, since the height of the 2008 global financial crisis, but the knock-on effect was a huge spike in trading.
OTC Markets Group, whose platforms are widely used to trade ADRs of firms like Tencent and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), provided figures to Reuters showing that average daily volumes soared to 43,776, which was a record $2.14 million in value terms.
Daily numbers show the most exaggerated moves began on Monday, July 26, after signals emerged that Beijing was also clamping down on education firms that provide intensive tutoring ahead of university entrance exams.
Volumes spiked to over 86,000 that day and continued rising all the way to 110,115 trades on the Wednesday when some firms' ADR prices temporarily roared back up. 
""It will be interesting to see how long this (trading surge) continues,"" said OTC's executive vice president for corporate services, Jason Paltrowitz.
Ramp-ups in dealing have not been limited to big banks and institutions.
Data from Britain's Interactive Investor, which mainly provides ""retail"" trading accounts for individuals, showed Alibaba - China's version of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) - was its most-traded international stock between Monday and Wednesday with a 75%-25% buy to sell ratio.
Similar figures from Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA), which are likely to be dominated by U.S.-based retail traders, showed Alibaba and electric vehicle makers Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng Inc were among the six most-bought stocks on the Tuesday when the rout was in full swing.
While OTC's numbers for July were not a record in actual volume numbers, the cost of the ADRs involved meant it was a record in value terms.
The $2.14 million daily average beat the previous record of just over $2 million back in January when the outgoing Donald Trump administration was pushing through dozens of U.S. investment bans on Chinese firms deemed to have military links. 

Chinese listings in the United States have still reached a record $12.8 billion so far this year, however, according to Refinitiv data, as companies have continued to try to capitalize on record-high U.S. stock markets.
Refinitiv's data also shows that inflows to China-focused U.S. investment funds in July were at their lowest level in 10 months.

The move will boost the TV operator's position, which like its peers, had been losing subscribers to video streaming services such as Netflix, Prime Video and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s service that offer award-wining and exclusive shows. 
DirecTV said as a part of the deal, customers who were previously AT&T satellite, streaming or IP video subscribers will get to keep their video service and any bundled wireless or internet services, including HBO Max. 
AT&T in February agreed to sell about a third of its stake in DirecTV to TPG Capital in a deal that valued the business at $16.25 billion, well below the $68 billion AT&T had paid for the asset less than six years ago.

AT&T has been under pressure to trim its swelling debt pile as it invests more in 5G and other wireless services.

(Reuters) -Zoom Video Communications Inc agreed to pay $85 million and bolster its security practices to settle a lawsuit claiming it violated users' privacy rights by sharing personal data with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and LinkedIn, and letting hackers disrupt Zoom meetings in a practice called Zoombombing.
A preliminary settlement filed on Saturday afternoon requires approval by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California.
Subscribers in the proposed class action would be eligible for 15% refunds on their core subscriptions or $25, whichever is larger, while others could receive up to $15.
Zoom agreed to security measures including alerting users when meeting hosts or other participants use third-party apps in meetings, and to provide specialized training to employees on privacy and data handling.
The San Jose-based company denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.
In a statement on Sunday, Zoom said: ""The privacy and security of our users are top priorities for Zoom, and we take seriously the trust our users place in us.""
Saturday's settlement came after Koh on March 11 let the plaintiffs pursue some contract-based claims.
Though Zoom collected about $1.3 billion in Zoom Meetings subscriptions from class members, the plaintiffs' lawyers called the $85 million settlement reasonable given the litigation risks. They intend to seek up to $21.25 million for legal fees.
Zoombombing is where outsiders hijack Zoom meetings and display pornography, use racist language or post other disturbing content.
Koh said Zoom was ""mostly"" immune for Zoombombing under Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability over user content.
Zoom's customer base has grown sixfold since the COVID-19 pandemic forced more people to work from home.

The company had 497,000 customers with more than 10 employees in April 2021, up from 81,900 in January 2020. It has said user growth could slow or decline as more people get vaccines and return to work or school in-person.

Investing.com -- The U.S. Senate’s move ahead with a $1 trillion infrastructure plan helped support stocks despite growing concerns that a surge in new coronavirus infections could dent the economic recovery.
Corporate earnings are also helping the mood on Wall Street, and this week promises another big slate of reports from about one-quarter of the S&P 500. On Monday, stock trading was muted, with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading down slightly heading into the close.
On Sunday, the Senate finally revealed a bipartisan plan to spend on roads, bridges, railways and high-speed internet service, and some lawmakers said it was on track for passage as early as this week.
Earlier in Monday, oil prices fell about 4% on weak economic data out of China and the U.S., which happen to be the biggest buyers of oil. Weakness in demand -- especially if businesses have to cut back activity because of a surge in virus cases -- will weigh on crude prices. 
Manufacturing activity in the U.S. slowed in July for the second in a row. But most analysts are focused on Friday’s report on jobs added in July as a litmus test for the economic recovery so far. 
A flurry of large retailers, including  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), now strongly encourage customers to wear masks inside their stores after public health officials urged even vaccinated Americans to use masks indoors in locations where the virus has a high rate of transmission.

For more than 15 years, automakers and others have studied potential technological fixes to address the roughly one-third of annual U.S. traffic deaths that involved impaired drivers.
The legislative push has won the backing of the advocacy group Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the auto insurance industry and some alcohol trade associations.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) said last year in a study that alcohol-detection systems that prevent impaired driving could save upward of 9,000 lives annually.
Drunk driving deaths cost the United States $44 billion in economic costs and $210 billion in comprehensive societal costs, according to a 2010 study. U.S. police departments arrest about 1 million people a year for alcohol-impaired driving, IIHS said.
Questions remain, however, whether the technology is accurate enough for widespread use and which one would be adopted.
In 2019, lawmakers told Reuters that automakers could use devices that would determine a driver's blood alcohol level by their touching the steering wheel or engine start button, or could install sensors that would passively monitor a driver's breath or eye-movements.
The bill would require the U.S. Transportation Department to set a technology safety standard within three years - and then give automakers at least another two years to comply - as long as new requirements are ""reasonable, practicable, and appropriate.""
The bill said if regulators do not finalize new safety rules within 10 years, the department must report to Congress.
Some convicted drunk drivers are required to use breath-testing devices attached to an ignition interlock before starting their vehicles.
The Senate bill does not specify the technology but said it must ""passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired.""
Of the 36,096 traffic fatalities in 2019, there were an estimated 10,142 people killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and automakers have researched one system that samples a driver’s breathing, while another technology measures blood alcohol levels under the skin’s surface by shining an infrared light through the driver's fingertip.
In 1974, Congress passed legislation reversing mandatory seat belt interlocks on automobiles. The government had mandated that vehicles sold after August 1973 require drivers fasten safety belts before they could be started.

So, we think it could be wise to scoop up the shares of quality industrial stocks Vale (VALE), CEMEX (CX),  Owens Corning  (NYSE:OC), and ITT (NYSE:ITT). Read on for additional insight.The resurgence of COVID-19 cases due to the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant has been a significant concern for investors looking to benefit from the economic recovery. However,  Goldman Sachs Group , Inc. (NYSE:GS) equity strategist David Kostin said recently that “the new strain should not pose a major market risk.”
The Federal Reserve’s near-zero interest rates, a rapid vaccination program, and supportive government policies have boosted the industrial sector’s growth. Furthermore, U.S. Senators unveiled a nearly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package yesterday, which includes $550 billion in new spending for roads, rails, and bridges, among other infrastructure. This proposed spending is expected to help the sector grow significantly in the coming months.
Given this backdrop, the shares of fundamentally strong industrial companies Vale S.A. (VALE), CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (CX), Owens Corning (NYSE:GLW) (OC), and ITT Inc. (ITT) should soar. So, if one has current plans to invest $1,000, we believe buying these three stocks could be rewarding.

Moller-Maersk, on Monday lifted its full-year earnings outlook after reporting strong preliminary quarterly results as chaotic conditions in the global supply chain pushed freight rates higher.
In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, shortages of container ships and logjams at ports around the world combined with high consumer demand for material goods have caused freight rates to skyrocket to record levels. 
""The strong quarterly performance is mainly driven by the continuation of the exceptional market situation with a strong rebound in demand causing bottlenecks in the supply chains and equipment shortage,"" Maersk said in a statement.
Maersk, which handles one in five containers shipped worldwide, expects the global market to continue growing for the remainder of the year, and now forecasts full-year demand growth of 6-8%, revised up from 5-7%, primarily driven by exports from China to the United States.
This would also result in third-quarter earnings exceeding the second quarter's, the company said, but warned of demand volatility. 
Maersk now expects full-year underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in the range of $18-19.5 billion, up from a previous estimate of between $13-15 billion. 

It said volumes in its Ocean division, it's biggest, increased by 15% in the second quarter from a year earlier, while average freight rates jumped 59%. 
The company, set to publish full second-quarter earnings on Aug. 6, also reported preliminary second-quarter revenue of $14.2 billion and underlying EBITDA of $5.1 billion.

Small-cap stocks, which have historically outperformed their large-cap peers over the long-term, tend to perform well during economic recoveries. This is why investors should consider small-cap stocks such as Greif Inc. (NYSE:GEF), Inter Parfums, Inc. (NASDAQ:IPAR), and Abercrombie & Fitch Company (ANF).As the economy continues to grow, it's a great time to consider small-cap (short for small capitalization) stocks. A stock is considered a small-cap if it has a market capitalization between $300 million and $2 billion. Often, smaller companies provide opportunities for growth that larger companies cannot.
This is due to the law of large numbers. This means it's more difficult for larger companies to grow as they get bigger. Plus, small-cap stocks have historically outperformed their larger-cap peers. From December 31st, 2000 to December 31st, 2020, the small-cap Russell 2000 index returned 308.4%, significantly outperforming the 184.5% gain of the large-cap S&P 500 index. 
Small-cap stocks also benefit from an economic recovery as they are more sensitive to the economy. So far this year, the Russell 2000 is already up 13.6%. This means that as the economic recovery continues, small-cap stocks like Greif Inc. (GEF), Inter Parfums, Inc. (IPAR), and Abercrombie & Fitch Company (ANF) are definitely worth considering.

Read on.The U.S. stock market has opened the first trading session of August in the green. Investors have lately been shrugging off concerns regarding the economic repercussions of the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant. This is because the U.S. officially fully recovered from the pandemic in the second quarter with 6.5% GDP growth. Moreover, a recently approved bipartisan infrastructure bill proposal and the Fed’s unabated loose monetary policy are expected to keep the market bullish, offsetting concerns related to the resurgence of COVID-19.
Nevertheless, China’s crackdown on U.S. listings, and multi-year high inflation rates, are expected to remain the biggest drivers of market volatility. The CBOE Volatility Index has gained 5.7% over the past five days and 1.9% in the pre-market session today.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%, or 26 points, though had hit an intraday record of 35,192.11. The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, and the Nasdaq was up 0.4%.
Materials were the biggest drag on the broader market, weighed down by a 3% decline in Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS) ahead of its quarterly results due after the closing bell.
Wall Street analysts are expecting Mosaic to report earnings per share of 99 cents on revenue of $2.85 billion.
The broader technology sector was helped by a climb in iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:chipstocks) following a 14% surge in  ON Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:ON).
ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) delivered a better-than-expected outlook after reporting quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates despite the ongoing supply chain constraints.

LONDON (Reuters) - London Stock Exchange's Refinitiv news and data platform Eikon experienced an outage of several hours on Monday, the company said, its third such glitch this year.
The company reported similar issues in April and June. 
An LSEG customer support representative said the issue which started around 1430 GMT had mostly affected users in Asia and the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, leaving them able to see news headlines and prices but unable to open articles or data tools.
Refinitiv is investigating the cause, the representative said.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 01:51PM ET</span>",Financial regulators urgently need to get a grip on 'Big Tech' -BIS,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Central banks and financial regulators urgently need to get to grips with the growing influence of 'Big Tech', according to top officials from central bank umbrella group the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). 
Global watchdogs are increasingly wary that the huge amounts of data controlled by groups such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) could allow them to reshape finance so rapidly that it destabilises entire banking systems.
The BIS, in a paper led by its head Agustin Carstens, pointed to examples such as China where the two big tech payment firms Alipay and WeChat Pay now account for 94% of the mobile payments market.
China has already rattled its markets with a series of clampdowns https://www.reuters.com/world/china/no-gain-without-pain-why-chinas-reform-push-must-hurt-investors-2021-07-28 on top tech and e-commerce firms. Last November regulators torpedoed the public listing of Jack Ma's fintech Ant Group and in the nine months since other tech giants and, lately, tutoring firms, have all faced scrutiny. 
In many other jurisdictions too, tech firms are rapidly establishing footprints, with some also lending to individuals and small businesses as well as offering insurance and wealth management services.
""The entry of big techs into financial services gives rise to new challenges surrounding the concentration of market power and data governance,"" the BIS paper https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull45.pdf published on Monday said.
There was scope for ""specific entity-based rules"" notably in the European Union, China and the United States, it added.
""Any impact on the integrity of the monetary system arising from the emergence of dominant platforms ought to be a key concern for the central bank."" 
Stablecoins - cryptocurrencies pegged to existing currencies such as Facebook's Diem - and other Big Tech initiatives could be ""a game changer"" for the monetary system, the paper added, if the ""network effects"" of social media and e-commerce platforms turbo-charged their uptake. 
It could lead to a fragmentation of existing payment infrastructures to the detriment of the public good. ""Given the potential for rapid change, the absence of currently dominant platforms should not be a source of comfort for central banks,"" the paper said. 

It said they should anticipate developments and formulate policy based on possible scenarios where Big Tech initiatives are already reshaping payments and other parts of financial systems.
""Central banks and financial regulators should invest with urgency in monitoring and understanding these developments"" it added. ""In this way, they can be prepared to act quickly when needed.""

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 01:33PM ET</span>",Twitter's Dorsey leads $29 billion buyout of lending pioneer Afterpay,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Square Inc, the payments firm of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) co-founder Jack Dorsey, will purchase buy now, pay later pioneer Afterpay Ltd for $29 billion, creating a transactions giant that will battle banks and tech firms in the financial sector's fastest-growing business.
The takeover, Square's biggest deal to date and the largest buyout ever of an Australian firm, underscores the popularity of a business model that has upended consumer credit by charging merchants a fee to offer small point-of-sale loans which shoppers repay in interest-free instalments, bypassing credit checks.
The buy now, pay later (BNPL) market has boomed in the past year as homebound consumers used it to borrow and spend online during the pandemic, and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were the latest heavyweights reported last month to be readying a version of the service.
Square's buyout could pave the way for more acquisitions, with Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA),  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V),  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) and others showing interest, said Christopher Brendler, an analyst with brokerage group D.A. Davidson.
""(BNPL) is more mainstream now and (this deal) is going to raise attention,"" he said.
Shares in Square surged 11%, while those in peer Affirm Holdings Inc rose as much as 17%.
Afterpay shareholders will get 0.375 of Square class A stock for every share they own, implying a price of A$126.21 per share based on Square's Friday close, the companies said. Afterpay shares closed at A$114.80, up 19%.
The buyout delivers a payday of almost A$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) each for founders Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar. China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd, which paid A$300 million for 5% of Afterpay in 2020, will pocket A$1.7 billion.
U.S. USERS
The deal, which eclipses the previous record for a completed Australian buyout, locks in a remarkable run for Afterpay, whose stock was worth just A$10 in early 2020.
The Melbourne-based company has signed up millions of users in the United States in the past year, making it one of the fastest-growing markets for BNPL and spurring broad interest in the sector.
""Acquiring Afterpay is a 'proof of concept' moment for buy now, pay later,"" Truist Securities analysts said, adding Square would now be a ""formidable"" competitor for Paypal, unlisted Swedish startup Klarna Inc and others.
Klarna was worth $46 billion in its last fundraising in June. Shares in Australian BNPL peers Zip Co Ltd and Sezzle Inc also closed higher on Monday.
""Not surprised those stocks are increasing on future consolidation speculations,"" D.A. Davidson's Brendler said. ""Competition is heating up and they also have platforms that are very attractive.""
Talks between the two companies began more than a year ago and Square was confident there was no rival offer, a person with direct knowledge of the deal told Reuters.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said the tie-up seemed to be an ""obvious fit"" with ""strategic merit"" based on cross-selling payment products, and agreed a competing bid was unlikely.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which would need to approve the transaction, said it had been notified of the plan and ""will consider it carefully once we see the details"".
""Few other suitors are as well-suited as Square,"" said Wilsons Advisory and Stockbroking analysts in a research note.
""With ... PayPal already achieving early success in their native BNPL, other than major U.S. tech-titans (Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc) lobbying an 11-th hour bid, we expect a competing proposal from a new party to be low-risk.""
The deal includes a break clause worth A$385 million triggered by certain circumstances such as if Square investors do not approve the takeover.
POPULARITY
BNPL firms lend shoppers instant funds, typically up to a few thousand dollars, which can be paid off interest-free.
As they generally make money from merchant commission and late fees - and not interest payments - they sidestep the legal definition of credit and therefore credit laws.
That means BNPL providers are not required to run background checks on new accounts, unlike credit card companies, and normally request just an applicant's name, address and birth date. Critics say that makes the system an easier fraud target.
For Afterpay, the deal with Square delivers a large customer base in the United States, where its fiscal 2021 sales have already nearly tripled to A$11.1 billion in constant currency terms.
Square said it will undertake a secondary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange to allow Afterpay shareholders to trade in shares via CHESS depositary interests (CDIs).

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) advised Square on the deal, while Goldman Sachs and Highbury Partnership consulted for Afterpay and its board.

1028,By StockNews,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>",2 Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 10 Years,"With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, the pharmaceutical sector is expected to attract significant investor attention in the coming months as the demand for vaccines and treatment continues to soar. Also, the rising demand for medicines and therapies for treating several critical diseases (other than COVID-19) is likely to propel the industry's growth further. Given the pharmaceutical industry’s tremendous growth potential, we believe established players in this space,  Pfizer  (PFE) and Eli Lilly (LLY), could be ideal buy-and-hold stocks for the next decade. Let's discuss.
As the COVID-19 Delta variant continues its rapid spread, COVID-19 cases are resurfacing in the United States, which has dragged the pharma sector back to center stage. As several countries continue to prioritize the vaccination of their populations to fight the coming new strains of the COVID-19 virus, pharmaceutical companies are now again focused on ramping up their vaccine production to meet the growing demand.
But the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases throughout the world is also expected to drive the demand for pharma products. Furthermore, the digital revolution in providing life-transforming treatments to patients and increasing investments in R&D to develop efficient drugs to fight various critical health conditions are expected to be the major growth drivers of pharmaceutical companies. Consequently, the global pharmaceuticals market is expected to hit $1,700.97 billion in 2025, registering an 8% CAGR
Given this backdrop, shares of leading pharmaceutical companies with resilient business models—Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)—hold solid upside potential. So, we believe these two stocks could be solid buy-and-hold bets for the next 10 years.

Given this backdrop, footwear companies Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) (ADDY), Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (UAA), and Skechers U.S.A. (SKX) should witness a substantial rise in shoe sales in the coming quarters. So, we think these three stocks could be solid bets now.With nearly 50% of the total U.S. population fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has urged schools to fully resume in-person classes by this fall. The CDC has issued a list of guidelines to minimize the spread of the virus because children below 12 years of age remain ineligible for the vaccine. New York City, which has the country’s most extensive schooling system, recently announced that it would not provide a remote learning option this fall in an effort to reopen schools at full capacity.
Footwear companies are likely to benefit from such reopening mandates, given the rising demand for outdoor footwear from the 18 years of age or below demographic.
Thus, we believe popular footwear companies  Adidas AG  (DE:ADSGN) (ADDYY), Under Armour, Inc. (UAA), and Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX) are likely to witness ballooning sales in the coming quarters, which should help their stocks advance.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 12:51PM ET</span>",Italy's Treasury under siege over Monte dei Paschi deal,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Valentina Za
ROME (Reuters) -Italy's Treasury is under fire from ruling parties seeking guarantees for Monte dei Paschi's employees and Siena's local economy, after the ministry entered exclusive talks to sell the ailing Tuscan bank to UniCredit.
Italy owns 64% of Monte dei Paschi (MPS), after a 5.4 billion euro ($6.4 billion) 2017 bailout. It has committed to returning the world's oldest bank to private hands by mid-2022, but its capital needs of 2.5 billion euros have made finding a solution more urgent.
UniCredit started talks last week on buying ""selected parts"" of MPS, a day before a Europe-wide banking health check showed a prolonged economic shock would wipe out the state-owned lender's capital.
The start of the negotiations, which are set to last 40 days, has sparked a barrage of demands from ruling parties, with Economy Minister Daniele Franco due to appear in parliament this week to answer questions on the matter.
The Treasury, hopeful of finally resolving the state-controlled bank's decade-long crisis, had not reckoned with the immediate political push back. 
""We do not agree with the idea of breaking up the bank. MPS' territorial roots in Tuscany, its workers and brand must be safeguarded,"" Antonio Misiani, economic chief for the co-ruling, centre-left Democratic Party (PD), told Reuters. 
Job cuts are the main problem for unions and politicians. Redundancies of nearly a third of MPS' current 21,000 staff are expected and these cuts would need to be agreed before the deal with UniCredit is finalised and paid for by state, a source close to the matter said.
""To cut 6,000-7,000 jobs is just unthinkable, workers need guarantees,"" Giulio Centemero, a senior lawmaker from the right-wing League party, which also backs Mario Draghi's national unity government, told Reuters.
Unions have requested a meeting with the Treasury, Lando Maria Sileoni, head of banking union FABI said.
To clear its bailout, MPS had agreed to cut 4,800 staff as part of a restructuring plan through 2021. 
MPS and politics have long been closely linked. Siena, where MPS' central offices employ around 1,400 people, is a traditional stronghold of the PD party, which has often been criticised for contributing to the bank's troubles. 
Now the political stakes are even higher because the PD's national leader, Enrico Letta, who has no seat in parliament, has chosen an upcoming by-election in Siena to try to get one.
'TOUGH TERMS'
In Italy, banks usually only lay off people heading towards retirement and pay between 80 and 90% of their salary for up to seven years until they qualify for their pension.
With an average cost of 200,000 euros for an employee that is four-and-a-half years away from pension, MPS' staff cuts could cost the state more than 1.4 billion euros. 
""We need to calculate how much UniCredit's tough terms for a deal are going to cost taxpayers and assess alternative solutions,"" said the League's Centemero.
To consider an acquisition, UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel has demanded that any deal would leave the Milanese bank's capital buffers unaffected, while boosting UniCredit's earnings per share by at least 10%.
His conditions will be costly for state coffers, but Rome set a precedent in 2017 when it paid Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) 4.8 billion euros to buy for one euro the good assets of two regional banks in the Veneto region.
As it did with the Veneto banks, the state is due to keep MPS' problem loans and legal risks stemming from mismanagement.
A person with knowledge of the matter said the Treasury was confident MPS' bondholders would not be asked to share the costs taxpayers will face to clinch a sale to UniCredit.
The last word on the fate of MPS lies with PM Draghi, who is not actively involved in the talks with UniCredit, a source from his office said.

A government source said the Treasury was committed to protecting jobs and making sure UniCredit takes on as many workers as possible. The Treasury will also strive to preserve the MPS brand in some of its Tuscan branches, the source added.

MILAN (Reuters) -Ferrari, the sports car maker synonymous with roaring petrol engines, welcomes the shift to electric powertrains and is confident of retaining its lead in the market for high performance cars, its chairman said on Monday.
The European Union last month proposed an effective ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035 as part of its measures to combat global warming, posing a challenge to automakers that have made powerful engines a key selling point. 
But Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) Chairman and acting CEO John Elkann told analysts on Monday the company known for its 'Prancing Horse' logo saw the change in technology as an opportunity. 
""We see the regulation as welcome,"" Elkann said, as Ferrari stuck to its main 2021 targets after reporting second-quarter core profits just ahead of expectations.
""The opportunity set by electrification, electronics and other technologies that are coming available will allow us to make even more distinct and unique products,"" he said.
Elkann, the scion of Italy's Agnelli family which controls Ferrari through its investment company Exor (OTC:EXXRF), was speaking weeks before new CEO - technology industry veteran Benedetto Vigna - takes the helm on Sept. 1. 
One of Vigna's tasks could be to forge new partnerships, along the lines of Ferrari's existing tie up with Britain's Yasa, now part of Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), to help with the shift to an electric era, Elkann said. 
""We believe that within the industry and more importantly, outside of our industry, we are going to benefit much from partnerships and joint programmes,"" he said.
Ferrari has pledged to launch its first all-electric car in 2025.
On Monday, the company reported a tripling in adjusted core earnings (EBITDA) for the second quarter to 386 million euros ($458 million) as shipments recovered from pandemic-hit trading in the same period last year. That was just ahead of analysts' mean forecast of 373 million euros.
Ferrari increased its industrial free cash flow guidance for this year to around 450 million euros from around 350 million, but left forecasts for net revenues and adjusted core earnings (EBITDA) unchanged. 
Its Milan-listed shares fell as much as 3.45% after the results. They closed down 1.9%.

Citi analysts said the unchanged earnings guidance, despite strong second-quarter results, raised concerns that margins were expected to come under pressure in the second half.

(Reuters) -Abbott Laboratories will pay $160 million to resolve claims that two of its units submitted false claims to Medicare by providing kickbacks to diabetes patients, including ""free"" or ""no cost"" glucose monitors, the U.S. Department of Justice said.
Monday's settlement resolves claims that Arriva Medical LLC - once the largest Medicare mail-order diabetes testing supplier - and its parent Alere Inc violated the federal False Claims Act from 2009 to 2016 by diverting Medicare funding from where it was needed.
The Justice Department said Arriva provided free glucose monitors, or glucometers, to induce patients to order more testing supplies, and routinely waived copayments.
Arriva was also accused of systematically charging Medicare, a U.S. government health plan, for glucometers given to ineligible patients, and submitting claims for 211 patients who had been dead at least two weeks.
Abbott, an Illinois-based medical device and nutritional products company, bought Alere for $4.5 billion in October 2017.
Arriva ceased operations two months later. Its founders, David Wallace and Timothy Stocksdale, agreed in April 2019 to pay $500,000 each to resolve Justice Department claims over the alleged kickbacks.
In a statement, Abbott did not comment on the settlement, but said Alere disclosed the matter in its financial filings. The defendants did not admit liability.
Gregory Goodman, a whistleblower and former $15-an-hour employee at an Arriva call center in Antioch, Tennessee, will receive $28.5 million from the settlement.
""Doing anything that defrauds the government or the Medicare program, it's fellow Americans who end up paying for it,"" Goodman, who turns 60 this week and recently retired from a career in sales, said in an interview. ""The decision to move forward was quite simple.""

Goodman's lawyer, Jerry Martin, a former U.S. attorney in Tennessee, said in an interview: ""It shows you the power of the False Claims Act and how it can be harnessed to get big results.""
The False Claims Act lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the federal government, and share in recoveries.

(Reuters) -Piedmont Lithium Inc said on Monday it will delay first shipments of lithium chemicals to electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and that it does not have a definitive date for when deliveries could begin. 
The decision was mutual, Belmont, North Carolina-based Piedmont said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The initial contract, signed last September, called for Piedmont to begin supplying Tesla sometime between July 2022 and July 2023 from a North Carolina lithium mine and processing facilities under development.
Reuters reported last month https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/push-supply-tesla-piedmont-lithium-irks-north-carolina-neighbors-2021-07-20 that North Carolina officials have voiced concerns about Piedmont's project - which would be one of the largest U.S. lithium mines - and may now block or delay it. The company plans to apply for a state mining permit this month.
Tesla, meanwhile, is building a plant in Texas that will convert Piedmont's spodumene concentrate into lithium hydroxide, a key building block for EV batteries. The automaker applied for Texas permits for its facility in April, according to state records, though it is unclear when that facility will be operational.
Piedmont said it is trying to sync its project development schedule with that of Tesla.
""We have built in some degree of flexibility based upon the needs of our customers and their timelines, and that consideration is mutually agreed upon,"" Piedmont spokesperson Brian Risinger said.

Piedmont is looking for investors to help fund the $840 million project. The company said on Monday it will apply next month for a loan from the U.S. Department of Energy's https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ceraweek-usa-granholm-idUKKBN2AV1YS Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan program.
A class action lawsuit was filed last month against the company alleging that Piedmont's executives mislead investors about its project development timeline. Piedmont said on Monday it believes the suit ""to be entirely without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.""

Furthermore, because the supply of semiconductor chips is projected to improve in the coming months, the industry is expected to soon exhibit solid growth. So, we believe auto manufacturers Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF), Honda Motor (HMC), and Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) should deliver handsome returns in the near term. These stocks are rated A in our proprietary stock ratings system. Read on to learn more.Rebounding global demand for automobiles owing to massive economic stimulus, coupled with rising interest in electric vehicles (EVs), has been driving the performance of the auto manufacturing industry. Also, with increasing concerns over the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19, auto sales are expected to increase as people avoid public transport. According to Fitch Ratings, U.S. light vehicles sales are expected to hit 15.6 million in 2021, up nearly 10% from 2020. With most countries seeking to address climate change concerns over the next decade, auto manufacturers are also ramping up the production of EVs in anticipation of a continuing increase in demand.
Although the industry is facing an acute semiconductor chip shortage, the supply of semiconductors is anticipated to improve in the coming months based on measures taken by governments and businesses. Investors’ interest in the auto industry is evident in First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund’s (CARZ) 9.6% increase over the past three months.
Given this backdrop, we think shares of auto manufacturing leaders Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG (VWAGY), Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) (DDAIF), Honda Motor Co. Ltd (HMC), and Mazda Motor Corporation (MZDAY) could be wise bets now. Our proprietary POWR Ratings system currently has an A rating for these stocks.

Nio, Li Auto and Xpeng compete with U.S. electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which dominates the EV market in China.
Nio, the maker of the ES8 and ES6 electric sport-utility vehicles, said it delivered a total of 7,931 vehicles in July, up 124.5% from a year earlier. Deliveries had more than quadrupled in July 2020.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 11:07AM ET</span>",Morrisons shares at eight-year high ahead of expected bid battle,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in British supermarket Morrisons hit almost eight-year highs on Monday on investor hopes that the rebuffed U.S. private equity group CD&R would return with a higher offer to counter Fortress' in the $8.8 billion bid battle.
At 272 pence per share, Morrisons' stock has jumped well above the 252 pence recommended offer from Softbank-owned Fortress. CD&R has until next Monday to make a counter bid. Investors are due to vote on the Fortress bid on Aug. 16. 
The battle for Britain's fourth-largest supermarket is the most high-profile looming takeover in the country amid a raft of bids and counter bids, reflecting private equity's appetite for UK Plc and the cash-generating capabilities of well-run supermarkets. 
Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) sparked speculation it would return with a higher offer for Morrisons when it did not exit the picture following the rejection of its earlier 230 pence a share offer, instead keeping its options open. 
It would likely have to match Fortress' commitments to retain the company's strategy and management, and could talk up the experience its senior executives would bring to the table, including adviser Terry Leahy and partner Vindi Banga.
Leahy, who became a senior adviser to CD&R in 2011, spent 32 years at Britain's biggest supermarket Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) , including 14 as CEO. Banga, a partner at the U.S. group, spent 33 years at Unilever (NYSE:UL), a key food and drink supplier. 
SUITABLE OWNERS
CD&R could also justify a higher price if it seeks an operational tie-up between the supermarket and the independent petrol station and convenience retail operator it owns, Motor Fuel Group, which could lead to Morrisons-branded forecourts. 
Morrisons rival Asda was recently bought by entrepreneurs, the Issa brothers, and TDR Capital, which combined its petrol stations with an existing petrol business they owned. 
Morrisons however is so far set on the offer from Fortress, which is backed by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Koch Real Estate Investments. 
It has described them as suitable owners for a business with more than 110,000 staff and a deeply integrated supply chain, that includes for example its own meat and fish processing sites. Morrisons is unique among British supermarkets in making half of the fresh food it sells.
But major Morrison shareholders do not appear to agree, with Silchester and M&G indicating the offer is too low. 
William Woods, an analyst at Berstein, said in a note that any buyer making a higher bid would likely have to sell off additional assets, such as factories, warehouses or stores, to make a return. ""We struggle to see the returns of the current offer without significant asset sales,"" he said.

To pass, the offer needs the support of shareholders representing at least 75% in value of voting investors at the meeting.

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 11:06AM ET</span>","Uber, Lyft seen boosted by return of riders, but driver shortage, stubborn virus cloud outlook","By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Ride hailing companies Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) promised Wall Street they would be back on the road to profitability and growth by the time they reported second-quarter results this week, thanks to cost-cutting done to survive the pandemic. 
Now, concerns over an ongoing driver shortage and the spreading Delta variant are clouding the outlook for making good on achieving profitable operations this year.
The ride-hail companies' core businesses are closely tied to broader economic activity and provide insights into the comfort levels of Americans and Europeans in resuming pre-pandemic activities. Uber has been moving to expand into goods and meal delivery to reduce dependence on rides. 
During the second quarter, many countries reopened their economies, and analysts expect Uber and Lyft will report revenues rebounded.
But a rapid spread of the more contagious Delta variant has prompted several health authorities to reimpose some restrictions. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sounded alarms on Friday with a report that the Delta variant is as contagious as chicken pox and can be passed on by people who are vaccinated.
""The continued uncertainty around the pandemic's trajectory will suppress both supply and demand for rideshare services until we see what the Delta variant's death toll really is,"" said Forrester analyst James McQuivey. 
The Delta variant complicates efforts by both companies to achieve profitability this year on a basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The adjustments exclude one-time costs, including stock-based compensation. 
Lyft said it would achieve that target by the end of the third quarter, Uber by the end of this year.
Lyft in May said it would take advantage of its leaner cost structure to make more money per ride as passengers return to the platform in greater numbers. Uber, also in May, said it would become profitable in the second half of 2021, requiring the company to quickly reduce losses.
DRIVER SHORTAGES PERSIST
During the second quarter, when it appeared the coronavirus threat was receding, Uber and Lyft were focused on luring drivers back with large pay incentives. 
Analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets in a note said the incentives were proving effective at getting more drivers on the platforms, allowing the companies to start strategically dialing back the extra pay.
KeyBanc said its proprietary data showed guaranteed fares per ride dropped 5.5% to $14.78 from June to mid-July.
Public data from regulators in Chicago and New York City, two of the companies' largest markets, shows a continued growth in trips and vehicles in recent months.
In New York City, the number of ride-hail vehicles has increased more than 20% from February to June, according to data from the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission. But total NYC vehicles in June are still more than 30% below their highest level in March 2019.
Several analysts said they expect rider demand to continue to outpace driver supply in the coming months. 
""Uber has had a bumpy ride through the pandemic but fresh signs that it's becoming a much smoother journey are expected in the upcoming numbers,"" said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
Lyft, which reports after the bell on Tuesday, is expected to post an adjusted second-quarter EBITDA loss of nearly $50 million on revenue of $697 million, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts on average expect Uber, which reports after market close on Wednesday, to post a $319 million adjusted EBITDA loss on revenue of $3.7 billion.

Uber has also used the pandemic to double down on its delivery business, with Uber Eats restaurant orders offsetting ride-hail losses. The company is further expanding into the delivery space through its acquisition of alcohol delivery company Drizly and partnerships with U.S. grocery store giants Albertsons Companies Inc and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST).
""This change in consumer behavior is likely going to continue after the pandemic, adding depth to Uber's business model,"" said Jake Sherman, analyst at investing.com.

Investing.com – First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) stock rose 2.5% Monday with at least three brokerages raising their price targets for the provider of solar panels and related services.
Susquehanna sees the stock at $120, Cowen at $105 and Piper Sandler at $89. Susquehanna’s target is approximately 36% higher than First Solar’s current price of $88.15.
According to Susquehanna analyst Biju Perincheril, supply chain disruptions arising out of labor issues in China’s Xinjiang appear to be translating to higher demand and pricing power for First Solar’s thin-film panels.
Xinjiang -- where advocacy groups and a panel of U.N. experts say Uyghurs and other minorities have been subjected to mass arbitrary detention and forced to work against their will -- produces roughly half of global supply of polysilicon, a material critical for solar panels and semiconductors, according to Bloomberg.
China has denied the allegations, saying they’re an attempt to undermine successful businesses.
While 2022 module prices are already set, recent strength suggests prices could be flat year-on-year in 2023 and perhaps show an uptick in 2024, according to Perincheril.
Both Perincheril and Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne sounded optimistic on the company commissioning new capacities in India and Ohio this year."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Facebook's acquisition of U.S. customer service startup Kustomer may hurt competition and boost its market power in online advertising, European Union antitrust regulators warned on Monday as they opened a full-scale investigation into the deal.
The move by the European Commission comes amid regulatory concerns on both sides of the Atlantic that a buying spree of startups by big firms, which normally don't trigger competition scrutiny because of the low value of the deal, may be so-called killer acquisitions aimed at closing down nascent rivals.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the world's largest social network, announced the purchase of Kustomer to scale up its instant messaging app WhatsApp in November last year.
The EU executive, which acts as the bloc's competition enforcer, said the deal may result in Facebook blocking rivals' access to its units WhatsApp, Messenger or Instagram, which are key to customer relationship management (CRM) software.
Kustomer sells CRM software to businesses so they can communicate with consumers by phone, email, text messages, WhatsApp, Instagram and other channels.
The EU watchdog also cited concerns about Facebook's ability to better personalise and target online display advertising services using Kustomer's client data, giving it an advantage over rivals.
""It is important to closely review potentially problematic acquisitions by companies that are already dominant in certain markets,"" Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said.
""This applies in particular to the digital sector, where Facebook enjoys a leading position in both online display advertising and in over-the-top messaging channels,"" she said.
Facebook said it would continue to cooperate fully with the Commission's review. 
""The transaction is pro-competitive and will bring more innovation to businesses and consumers in the dynamic and competitive CRM space,"" it said in a statement. 
The U.S. company had declined to offer concessions during the Commission's preliminary review of the deal.
The Commission took over the case, citing a rarely used power known as Article 22 and following an Austrian request even though the deal falls below the EU turnover threshold.

Germany's antitrust agency last month said it was looking to see if Facebook should also seek its approval for the deal, based on the effect in the country and if Kustomer is active to a significant extent there.
Its UK peer the CMA last month kicked off an investigation into the case.

The DOJ investigation follows lawsuits by U.S. investors claiming close to $6 billion in losses from the funds, saying Allianz failed to safeguard their investments during the coronavirus market meltdown.
Allianz, in disclosing the DOJ investigation, warned of a ""relevant risk"" that the matter could ""materially impact future financial results of Allianz Group,"" without providing an estimate.
In March 2020, Allianz was forced to shutter two private hedge funds after severe losses, prompting a wave of litigation from pension funds for truckers, teachers and subway workers, with new suits filed as recently as last month.
The suits allege that the Allianz Global Investors money management arm, in its Structured Alpha family of funds, strayed from a strategy of using options to protect against a short-term financial market crash.
Allianz disclosed last year that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was also investigating the matter. Allianz said it was cooperating with both investigations.
""We believe that the potential costs or provisions associated with the investigation could be substantial and might lead us to reconsider our view of the group's earnings or capitalization,"" ratings agency S&P said on Monday.

Shares of Allianz traded as low as 189.90 euros ($225.64) and were down 7.2% at 195.06 euros per share at 1422 GMT.
A spokesman for Allianz Global Investors declined to comment. The DOJ didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

But while the current low interest-rate environment is favorable for NLY, can the stock gain in the near term despite the company’s agreement to sell its commercial real estate business in March 2021? Let’s find out.Mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NLY) has been paying regular, quarterly dividends for more than two decades. The company paid a $0.22 quarterly dividend on July 30, which cumulates to an $0.88 annual dividend and yields 10.37%. Its four-year average dividend yield is 12.47%.
Because the Federal Reserve has indicated that interest rate hikes could come in late 2023, this could adversely impact NLY’s net interest spread. The uncertainty surrounding the timing of the Fed’s tapering also continues to worry investors. NLY has retreated 6.5% over the past three months and 4.4% over the past month to close Friday’s trading session at $8.49.

However, the company has been struggling to generate revenue growth in the consumer cannabis market. In addition, since there are still substantial hurdles to federal-level legalization of cannabis, is ACB a risky bet now? Read more to find out.Based in Edmonton, Canada, Aurora Cannabis Inc. (ACB) is a vertically integrated producer and seller of medical cannabis worldwide. While ACB’s medical businesses in Canada and Europe delivered high revenues and growth in the third quarter of 2021, it suffered in other markets due to COVID-19 headwinds. Its consumer cannabis net revenue declined CAD20.5 million ($16.43 million) to CAD18.0 million ($14.43 million) from the prior-year period, due primarily to a reduction in orders with slower demand in the consumer cannabis market and a decrease in cannabis derivative sales.
ACB’s share price has slumped 15.5% so far this year and 22.4% over the past month. Closing yesterday’s trading session at $7.02, ACB’s stock is trading 63% below its 52-week high of $18.98, which it hit on February 10. Although the cannabis operator has been making substantial progress in diversifying its portfolio by launching new proprietary cultivars and expanding its footprint in the rapidly growing medical cannabis market in the U.K., it has been struggling to generate consistent revenue growth.
While investors remain optimistic about the positive momentum in legalizing cannabis at a federal level, uncertainty surrounding the Senate’s stance on the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, which was introduced earlier last month, could lead to volatility in cannabis stocks in the coming months. So, ACB’s shares could retreat further in the near term.

Thus, we believe cheap momentum stocks  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL), Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG), and Guess? (GES) are solid picks now. Read on.Increasing COVID-19 cases due to the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Delta variants have been prompting new pandemic restrictions in the United States.

With the consumer price index still surging and fears of a slowdown in economic activity still lurking, market volatility is probably here to stay for the foreseeable future.

Investing.com –  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) stock rose 1% in Amsterdam as the world’s second-largest brewer reported more-than-doubling of operating profit for the first half of the year.
A cut-back in expenses helped the profits as the company chose to withhold marketing and sales spend in markets that were under lockdown. The company aims to raise those investments and restore them to the levels before the pandemic by 2023.
Beer volumes grew 9.6%, led by 20% growth in Heineken. As many as 50 markets grew in double digits as they reopened after the lockdowns and people stepped out to eat and drink.
The contribution came from Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe and the Americas. Premium beer volume outperformed the broader portfolio with growth in the mid-teens, led by Heineken.
Heineken Silver more than quadrupled its volume, driven by strong growth in China and Vietnam.
The non-alcoholic beer and cider portfolio grew in high teens as growth continues in Europe, and volume more than doubled in the Americas.
Heineken Chairman and CEO Dolf Van Den Brink warned of higher commodity costs hurting in the current half of the year. He said they will have “. . . a material effect in 2022. Overall, we expect full year financial results to remain below 2019”.
He said COVID-19 remains a factor, with the biggest impact currently in key markets in Asia and Africa.

Over the weekend, Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard had repeated the central bank's message that the labor market was still too far from its pre-pandemic condition of health for the Fed to reduce its asset purchases, while both she and noted 'dove' Neel Kashkari at the Minnesota Fed warned about possible headwinds from the spread of the Covid-19 virus. 
Sentiment was also helped by news over the weekend that Chinese regulators were seeking dialogue with the Securities and Exchanges Commission over the issue of Chinese listings in the U.S.  A barrage of regulatory measures by Beijing has created a strong impression recently that the Communist Party was increasingly hostile to the idea of Chinese companies reporting data to U.S. regulators.  Expectations of fresh stimulus from China are also high after last week's Politburo meeting and further evidence of the manufacturing sector slowing down in July. The Caixin PMI fell to its lowest since April 2020, according to figures released overnight.
News that the U.S. Senate had reached agreement on a draft of a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure was also received positively, albeit with the caveat that the bill is likely to be held up in the House of Representatives.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Dutch brewing giant Heineken (OTC:HEINY) expects the COVID-19 pandemic to weigh on key Asian markets for the rest of the year and rising costs to dent margins, it said after posting a better than expected doubling of first-half earnings on Monday
Chief Executive Dolf van den Brink, who has been at the helm of the world's second-largest brewer for a year, said the company was pleased with the strong first half, but expressed caution, with results expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2021 as a whole.
""Unlike last year, we now see significant impact on the business in southeast Asia,"" Van den Brink told Reuters in a telephone interview on Monday, referring to the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
He said Vietnam, a top three market for Heineken, was a concern, with lockdowns imposed in its strongholds in cities and the south of the country. Elsewhere, the company's Malaysia brewery is shut and reduced tourism is hitting Indonesian sales.
The maker of Europe's top-selling lager Heineken, Tiger and Sol, previously forecast an improvement in market conditions in the second half of 2021, depending on vaccine roll-outs. 
Rising commodity costs, including for barley, sugar and aluminium for cans, would start affecting Heineken in the second half of 2021 and would have a ""material effect"" in 2022, when hedging contracts were no longer mitigating the increases.
Marketing expenses would also be skewed towards the second half as bars reopened.
Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, last week reported a surge in beer sales in the second quarter, but higher can and transport costs curbed profits. 
Heineken sold almost 10% more beer in the first half than a year ago and Van den Brink said the company would seek to be ""assertive"" on pricing, having achieved nearly 10% higher prices per hectolitre of beer in the Americas and Africa/Middle East in the first half.
Its shares rose almost 2% in early trading before giving up most of the gains to stand 0.5% higher at 98.74 euros by 0830 GMT.
Trevor Stirling, beverage analyst at Bernstein said he expected consensus earnings estimates for this year to rise. 
""The inflationary environment will be much higher next year. How much can they recover in pricing?""

The company said more than half of the savings under its three-year plan to save 2 billion euros and restore profit margins to pre-pandemic levels by 2023, partly through cutting 8,000 jobs, should be achieved by the end of 2021.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The use of hydrogen power for mobility is an ""interesting alternative"" for India, especially as it would reduce dependence on lithium imports, the chairman of Maruti Suzuki, India's top-selling carmaker, said on Monday. 
Demand for lithium for batteries is soaring as governments across the world push automakers to meet stringent targets for cutting carbon emissions, partly by phasing out internal combustion engines. 
In India, however, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by carmakers has been slow due to the high cost of batteries, as well as insufficient charging infrastructure. India also does not have lithium reserves, the majority of which are controlled by China globally. 
This makes EVs a hard sell in a country like India where per capita income is around $2,000, or about 5% of that in Europe and Japan, and 95% of cars sold are priced below $20,000, Maruti Chairman R.C. Bhargava told shareholders in the company's annual report. 
""We need to recognise that our strategy for moving towards net zero emission has to be consistent with the economic and infrastructure conditions prevailing in the country,"" Bhargava said.
To reduce fuel consumption and emissions, Maruti is pushing sales of cars that operate on compressed natural gas (CNG), and is also investing in hybrid technology, he said, adding that ""the use of hydrogen is also an interesting alternative"". 
Suzuki Motor Corp, which controls Maruti, is also prioritising development of clean technologies suitable for the Indian market, Bhargava said, adding that Suzuki's alliance with  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp in Japan would prove valuable for this effort.
Bhargava's comments come as debate around EVs is gathering steam in India, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc lobbying the government to lower import duties on electric cars.

Tesla's demands have polarised India's auto industry, with South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co - which has a share of about 18% of the country's car market and is Maruti's closest competitor - supporting a tax cut on imports.
Maruti's comments in support of hydrogen also come weeks after Mukesh Ambani, chairman of refiner Reliance Industries, said it would invest $10 billion in clean energy, including setting up giga factories to produce fuel cells and green hydrogen.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Australia's record merger-and-acquisition (M&A) boom can only intensify in the near term as ultra-low interest rates and confidence that the economy will rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to drive deal activity, bankers said.
The market received a boost on Monday after U.S. payments firm  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) said it would purchase buy now, pay later pioneer Afterpay Ltd for $29 billion in the biggest-ever buyout of an Australian company.
On the same day, Oil Search (OTC:OISHY) Ltd agreed to a raised $6.2 billion takeover bid from Santos Ltd. The deals helped M&A activity in Australia to its highest-ever year, Refinitiv figures showed.
The deal announcements came even as Australia struggles to stop the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus, with Queensland state on Monday extending social lockdown measures in Brisbane, while soldiers began patrolling Sydney to enforce stay-at-home rules.
Though Australia's vaccination drive has lagged many other developed economies, it has fared better in keeping infection numbers relatively low, with just under 34,400 cases.
""It's not just Australia, but globally there is a lot of confidence for M&A right now. Locally, Australia up until recently had done very well managing COVID-19. Sydney is in lockdown now and investors think that is likely to be short lived,"" said KPMG M&A partner Daniel Teper. 
There has been $174 billion worth of M&A deals announced in Australia in 2021, according to Refintiv data, an all-time high and about six times the value in the same period last year.
Australia's total accounts for about 22% of M&A deals value in Asia excluding Japan this year, its highest share in the region since 2011, the data showed.
""Australian M&A is being driven by ... low interest rates driving cheap debt, record equity markets, market stimulus, significant cash reserves sitting on balance sheets and in superannuation funds, and a focus on what next beyond the pandemic,"" said Duncan Hogg, EY Oceania head of M&A.
The Monday deals helped elevate Australia's benchmark stock index, the S&P/ASX200, to close up 1.34%.
Australian deals in 2021 have unfolded across sectors as varied as technology, gaming and aviation. Square's takeover of financial technology firm Afterpay comes two weeks after Sydney Airport Holdings Pty Ltd turned down a $16.6 billion bid from a consortium.
""The conditions are going to be favourable for some time,"" said PwC deals business leader Rob Silverwood. ""There is an abundance of capital in the corporate sector and private equity, we think we will see these high levels of activity for the next six to 12 months.""
As a result of the increased dealmaking, investment banks in Australia are getting their best payday in a decade, with M&A fees so far at $364.3 million, up nearly 50% from a year prior.

Australia has been a very good fee contributor to the region's M&A business, said a senior banker with a Wall Street lender that oversees Asia, who was not authorised to speak to the media and so declined to be identified.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which Refinitiv ranks first and second on Australia's league table for announced M&A deals, are advising Afterpay and Square, respectively.

1062,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 09:18AM ET</span>",China’s Elite Role in Emerging Markets Has Traders Creeping Back,"(Bloomberg) -- A recovery in Chinese stocks following a meltdown at the start of last week underscored how investors in emerging markets have few alternatives that are as big and liquid.
After ditching the Asian nation’s assets amid the turmoil, there are already signs that folks are creeping back. Traders piled a net $975 million into Chinese exchange-traded funds last week, more than all other developing nations tracked by Bloomberg combined. The benchmark CSI 300 Index rose as much as 2.7%, its best day since May 25.
“There’s no way that any global investor can ignore China unless there’s a complete embargo by the U.S. government,” said Mark Mobius, a veteran investor in emerging markets who spent three decades at Franklin Templeton Investments. “But that’s very unlikely.”
Despite all the risks associated with investing in the world’s second-largest economy, the sheer breadth of the market and its outsized share in key indexes means money managers often have no choice but to look past bouts of turbulence and maintain exposure.
Listen to the EM Weekly Podcast: China Turmoil, Central Bank Decisions, Peru
While the latest manufacturing data out of China point to a slowdown in activity, the nascent rebound in the nation’s battered equities may have room to run if funds begin to rebuild their positions and liquidity injections restore calm in financial markets.
Unsubstantiated rumors that Washington was going to restrict funds from investing in China and Hong Kong exacerbated the rout last week, which kicked off as Beijing widened a regulatory crackdown on its burgeoning tech industry. On Sunday, China’s securities regulator called for talks with its American counterpart after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission halted the initial public offerings of Chinese companies.
Regulatory Crackdown
At the height of the panic, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down almost 10% from last Friday’s close. Technology giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. shed about a fifth of its value and Meituan tumbled as much as 30% in the week.
But as the dust settles, focus is already turning to the money that eventually poured back into the country’s assets after an epic stock-market bust in 2015 and amid government efforts to stem steep declines in 2018. Exchange-traded fund investors were seen buying the dip in China last week, as cash flowing into U.S.-listed emerging market ETFs were led by inflows to funds tracking Chinese assets.
China makes up about one-third of MSCI Inc.’s emerging-market index, which means that it’s almost guaranteed to attract funds from money managers who track the benchmark. The promise of juicy gains will only help -- equity investors in China pocketed twice the average return across the developing world over the past decade.
“If one wants out, one could divest from China and invest the proceeds pro-rata across other countries,” said Gustavo Medeiros, London-based deputy head of research at Ashmore Group Plc. “But this is extreme.”
The economy’s closed nature can also insulate assets from volatility, with some investors even snapping up government bonds as an alternative to U.S. Treasuries. Inflows drove the yield on 10-year Chinese benchmark debt down almost 30 basis points this year, the most among major markets.
Low Correlation
So far in 2021, total assets invested in China via ETFs reached $252 billion, compared with about $10 billion in Brazil and $2.5 billion in South Africa.
“It’s very uncorrelated with other markets so not sure you can say who else would benefit,” said Charles Diebel, a money manager at Mediolanum SpA. “Because of the size of China, no alternative exists with the same risk profile.”
Last week’s rout also offered an opportunity to buy up assets on the cheap. The forward price-earnings ratio of the Shanghai Composite Index fell to a one-year low, bringing China’s valuation discount versus U.S. stocks to 45%, compared with a 20-year average of 11.4%.
“We see this selloff as an opening to add to some of our existing positions,” said Ali Akay, the London-based chief investment officer of hedge fund Carrhae Capital, which manages about $760 million in assets, pointing to “very attractive valuations.”
That’s not to say investors aren’t scouring other emerging markets for opportunities after the shake-up.
For Sergey Dergachev at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH in Frankfurt, markets that benefit the most from lower U.S. Treasury yields such as Russia and Turkey stand out. The benchmark MSCI equity index for emerging markets rose 1% Monday led by technology and health care stocks.
Still, there’s a sense that are few places within the asset class to escape if the market turns south again. “If the selloff in China credit continues, there would not be many places to hide in EM,” said Paul Greer, a money manager at Fidelity International.

A growing number of countries are looking at switching to different COVID-19 vaccines for second doses, a measure particularly necessary in Denmark after health authorities discontinued inoculations with AstraZeneca's vaccine in April over rare side-effect concerns.
More than 144,000 Danes, mostly frontline personnel in the health sector and the elderly, received their first jab with AstraZeneca's vaccine but were subsequently vaccinated with either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna's shots. 
""The study shows that fourteen days after a combined vaccination program, the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is reduced by 88% compared to unvaccinated individuals,"" the State Serum Institute (SSI) said. 
That is a ""high efficacy"", SSI added, comparable to the 90% efficacy rate of two doses from Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine, confirmed in a different Danish study. 
The study, published last week, covered a span of more than five months between February and June this year, a period in which the Alpha-variant of the coronavirus was predominant.

It could not conclude whether the same protection applied to the Delta-variant, which is now the most widespread in Denmark. 
It also provided no efficacy data on COVID-19 related deaths or hospitalisations, since none took place following the combined vaccination programme.

Investing.com –  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) stock was trading 0.5% lower as the company announced the acquisition of two smaller retailers for a combined $1.1 billion.
It is buying athletic retailer WSS for $750 million and Japan’s Atmos for $360 million. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. 
The stock traded higher with 0.5% gains for a while thereafter before giving up the gains.
The acquisitions are part of the company’s game-plan to move out of high-rental malls, a shift accelerated by the pandemic, which has hastened the growth of online commerce.
With the acquisition of WSS, that primarily operates on the West Coast, Foot Locker also gets to cater to the rapidly growing Hispanic consumer demographic.
WSS operates 93 off-mall stores and its community-driven business benefits from deep relationships with customers. Approximately 80% of its sales come from customers who are members of its loyalty program. WSS generated approximately $425 million in 2020.
Atmos is famous for its streetwear and fueling sneaker culture. Atmos has 39 stores in Japan and 10 elsewhere. Of its $175 million revenue in 2020, more than 60% was generated through digital channels.
Both the transactions are expected to close in the third quarter and will be funded with cash."

Agustin Carstens, general manager of the BIS, and three colleagues at the Basel-based institution said in a paper published Monday that the current system “is likely to fall short of an adequate response” to Big Tech’s move into finance.
“The current framework does not address the potential (possibly global) systemic impact of big tech operations and of possible spillover effects to the financial sector,” the officials wrote. Current licensing requirements for payments firms “were formulated with small remittance service providers in mind.”
The paper highlighted the surge in users of of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google, and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). as well as the more than 90% market share of mobile payments in China held by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. Tech firms can grow quickly in financial services because they can quickly roll out new products to their massive user bases, the BIS executives said.
The paper shows the growing concerns among central bankers and financial authorities over new forms of technology that are outside the traditional core of the banking system.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last month pushed top U.S. financial regulators to accelerate their consideration of new rules to police stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that’s seen rapid recent growth and remains largely unsupervised.

The company is buying California-based WSS for $750 million and Japanese streetwear retailer Atmos for $360 million, it said in separate statements.
Pent-up demand for sneakers and athletic gear from U.S. shoppers, as well as government stimulus have boosted  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL)'s sales this year, but the company has said it was looking to focus beyond malls whose traffic has been pressured by the pandemic and a surge in online shopping.
WSS has a fleet of 93 off-mall stores across California, Texas, Arizona and Nevada, and has a largely Hispanic consumer base which Foot Locker is looking to tap into.
Atmos, which has most of its 49 stores in Japan, is popular for its collection of special edition footwear in collaboration with brands including  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE). 

WSS and Atmos will continue to operate under their own names. Both the deals, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, will be funded through available cash, Foot Locker said.

The tariffs, dating back to 2009, will be extended until 2026, the EU official journal said on Monday.
The European Commission, which reviewed the case, concluded that U.S. producers could increase to full capacity and also divert sales from some of their exports from less profitable markets to the European Union, the world's largest market. 
It said U.S. producers were already selling to third countries at prices below those in the United States, meaning they were being dumped.
It also said U.S. producers were benefiting from subsidies, including tax credits, grants and loan guarantees.
The anti-dumping duties range from zero to 198.0 euros ($235.36) per tonne, and duties related to subsidies from 211.2 to 237.0 euros per tonne. The duties are not cumulative, so whichever is the higher rate of the two forms of duties applies.

They will continue to be imposed on a range of companies, including Archer Daniels Midlands Co and Cargill.
The initial case was brought by the European Biodiesel Board on behalf of EU producers such as France's Saipol and Germany's Verbio.

Investing.com – Stocks of BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) were up in Monday’s premarket trading as the companies landed new deals with the European Union to supply more COVID vaccines at substantially higher prices.  
BioNTech jumped 4% and Moderna 2%.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which jointly markets its vaccine with BioNTech, was up 1%. Expenses and profit from the vaccine are split equally between Pfizer and the German company.
According to the Financial Times, Pfizer and BioNTech will be paid 19.50 euro ($23.20) a shot, up more than 25% from their first contract, while Moderna will get $25.50, up over 10% from the previous price. The deals are for up to a total of 2.1 billion shots through 2023.
Vaccination in most parts of the world barring Israel, the U.K. and a few other countries, has been patchy. While governments struggle with vaccine hesitancy amongst people and try to procure vaccines from manufacturers, the virus continues to rage with varying intensities in many parts of the world.
The total addressable market for Covid-19 vaccines is expanding as countries start to introduce booster shot programs, against a backdrop of evidence that these provide longer-lasting immunity against the disease. Israel started rolling out booster shots to all those over 60 whose first jab was over five months ago. The U.K. government meanwhile is planning to offer booster shots to some 32 million adults from next months, the Telegraph newspaper reported on Sunday. Vaccine makers have also lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for booster shots, but the FDA's response so far has been non-committal. 
Last week, Pfizer said it expected $33.5 billion in revenue from sale of its COVID-19 vaccines. This reflects 2.1 billion doses expected to be delivered in 2021 under already-signed contracts as of middle of this month. It could supply up to 3 billion doses if expansion at current sites happens and new suppliers are added, the company said.
The issue of booster shots is open to controversy, given that many of the world's poorer countries are still struggling to source doses for their initial vaccination campaigns. Low rates of vaccination in emerging countries are making them particularly vulnerable to the delta variant of Covid-19, which is over twice as infectious as the initial strain."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, continuing the recent positive tone on the first trading day of August as investors digest generally strong corporate earnings and a dovish message from the Federal Reserve.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 95 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 17 points, or 0.4%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 55 points, or 0.4%.
The major U.S. indices posted their sixth straight month of gains in July, with the broad-based S&P 500 gaining over 2%, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 1.3% and the Nasdaq Composite 1.2%.
Helping the tone were comments over the weekend from Fed officials Lael Brainard and Neel Kashkari, both of whom warned of risks to the economic outlook and the big progress still needed to reach pre-pandemic employment levels. 
Additionally, the U.S. Senate looks set to complete work this week on a $1 trillion infrastructure investment bill, adding even more stimulus to the markets.
The major focus, however, has been on the corporate earnings season, which so far has been generally positive. Nearly two-thirds of the S&P 500 companies have reported second-quarter figures so far, and according to FactSet 88% have beaten consensus expectations. Companies' forward guidance hasn't been so uniformly positive, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all warning of various risks ahead.
Investors will get a fresh batch of reports in the week ahead from companies such as Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Uber (NYSE:UBER), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
Away from earnings, Square (NYSE:SQ) will be in focus after the payments company agreed to buy Australian fintech company Afterpay (ASX:APT) in an all-stock deal valued at $29 billion, which represents a roughly 30% premium to Afterpay’s last closing price.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) will also be in the spotlight after the drugmakers agreed a new contract with the European Union for their Covid-19 vaccines which included a substantial price rise.
Also, the Wall Street Journal reported that  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) will buy two retailers for a total of about $1.1 billion in cash deals.
The economic data slate includes the Institute of Supply Management’s final purchasing managers index for July, which is expected to stay close to historic highs.
Earlier Monday, China’s Caixin Manufacturing PMI fell to 50.3, its lowest since April last year, while Germany's final Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 65.9 in July from 65.1 in June.
Elsewhere, oil prices weakened Monday in response to the Chinese factory data slowing sharply in July, suggesting weakening economic growth in the largest crude importer in the world.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% lower at $72.67 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.4% to $74.34.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,811.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1889.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Police cleared climate activists from the heart of Zurich's financial district on Monday after dozens blocked entrances to offices of Switzerland's two biggest banks to protest against their financing of fossil fuel projects, authorities said.
Police in Switzerland's financial hub said they had taken around 30 people into temporary custody during the peaceful protest that was still under way around midday. 
Police led or carried away singing and chanting activists who had taken up positions at the entrances to the headquarters of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and a major UBS office block on Paradeplatz square in central Zurich after they refused to disperse. 
Credit Suisse and UBS have so far failed to respond adequately to the climate crisis, Frida Kohlmann, spokesperson for the Rise Up for Change group, said in a statement. ""That is why the climate justice movement is occupying the Credit Suisse headquarters and the nearby UBS office today to draw attention to the consequences of the Swiss financial institutions' inaction."" 
In response UBS said in a statement: ""Climate protection is a top priority at UBS ... We are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our business to net zero by 2050, with science-based interim targets for 2025, 2030 and 2035.""
Credit Suisse had no comment on the protest, but said: ""Credit Suisse is committed to climate protection and achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement,"" referring to the 2015 international treaty on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. 
It noted it was working help clients transition to low-carbon business models, aiming to provide at least 300 billion Swiss francs ($331.5 billion) in sustainable financing over the next decade. It also provides sustainable finance solutions for customers and was working to reduce its own carbon footprint.

The protest comes amid a wave of civil disobedience by activists in Switzerland, where the climate is warming at about twice the pace of the global average and changing its famed mountain landscapes.

The variant, first identified in India, is now the dominant one worldwide and has led to a spike in infection rates that has stoked widespread concerns over a economic recovery.
Labcorp said it saw a sequential decline in COVID-19 testing each month through the year with tests performed in month of June falling below the second-quarter average of 54,000 PCR tests per day.
""July was the first month, frankly, that we've seen the level of COVID testing higher than the prior month,"" said Glenn Eisenberg, Labcorp's Chief Financial Officer.

Based on Square’s closing price of $247.26 on July 30, this represents a price of A$126.21 per Afterpay share, a premium of approximately 31% to Afterpay’s Friday closing price of A$96.66. Following the transaction, Afterpay shareholders are expected to own approximately 18.5% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis.
BNPL platforms reaped the benefit of COVID when people, short on cash, have used them to buy products and services now and pay later.
Square attributed the Afterpay purchase to shifting consumer preferences away from credit cards, especially among younger consumers, consistent demand from merchants for new ways to grow their sales, and the global growth in omnichannel commerce.
Much of Afterpay’s revenue comes from retail merchants, who pay the company on a revenue-share basis on each order placed by the customer along with a fixed fee.
Backed by Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, Square plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units, enable even the smallest of merchants to offer BNPL at checkout and give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 05:35AM ET</span>",Dorsey-led $29 billion deal delivers prompt payday for Afterpay founders,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - A tweet by Kim Kardashian promoting Afterpay as a way to buy her beauty products may have proved pivotal for the Australian buy now, pay later pioneer, whose founders have since joined the reality TV superstar as billionaires.
Kardashian's recommendation in 2018 helped Afterpay, which has agreed a record $29 billion buyout by Square, the payments firm of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, crack the U.S. market.
Afterpay's rapid rise, which has culminated in Australia's biggest-ever deal and powered its stock market to record highs, began when an eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) vendor noticed young people avoiding credit cards after the 2008 financial crisis.
""It all started from seeing a shift in 2008 of millennials toward debit cards over credit cards,"" Afterpay co-founder Nick Molnar said in a 2020 Reuters interview. 
Molnar, 31, sold jewellery from his bedroom while studying commerce at University of Sydney, and he and Melbourne-headquartered Afterpay co-founder Anthony Eisen were neighbours.
He and Eisen, a 49-year-old former fund manager who specialised in tech firms, will each pocket A$2.46 billion ($1.8 billion) from the Dorsey-led deal, and stay on at the company.
Australian media have widely reported that Molnar is the country's youngest self-made billionaire. Alongside Eisen, he was ranked fifth richest among Australian executive directors, the Australian Financial Review reported in July.
The friends' success is built on the idea that they could offer shoppers a small loan that they would pay back in instalments, with the incentive that they could make more purchases if they repaid on time.
Afterpay would take a cut of 4-6% of the shelf price from the merchant, who would use its services to drive business.
They took the business live in 2014, picking up big-name clients like Woolworths, Myer Holdings and Wesfarmers' Officeworks. 
And just three years later it merged with its technology supplier, Touchcorp, to create an all-in-one service.
From 2017, Afterpay could vet shoppers and direct them to stores, while processing loans and repayments. Due to its low dollar value loans and its appeal to shoppers, Afterpay says it has lower default rates than other consumer loan methods.
However, the ride to riches for Molnar and Eisen has not always been smooth as Afterpay came under regulatory scrutiny both in Australia and the United States.
In 2019 Australia's anti-money laundering agency ordered an independent audit of Afterpay, citing ""concerns with its compliance"" and the rapid growth of buy now, pay later. It was subsequently given the all-clear.
And in 2020, Afterpay paid A$1.5 million to Californian regulators who said it was operating illegally since it started writing business there before it had a licence. The company denied any illegal behaviour.
PANDEMIC PAYDAY 
Afterpay bagged a Tencent investment in May 2020, sparking a protracted run-up as investors aligned their portfolios with the Chinese online giant.
And a boom in online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by fiscal stimulus cheques, sealed its lofty valuation. 
Its shares broke through A$100 in October and by February 2021 had hit A$160. 
Although Afterpay has yet to turn a net profit, it is one of Australia's 20 largest companies, alongside financial powerhouse Macquarie and telecoms giant Telstra (OTC:TLSYY).
Monday's deal locks in a stock valuation that some analysts have said is overpriced amid uncertainty around the COVID-19 Delta variant, varying levels of government relief funding and warnings that interest rates must rise from record lows.

""It's a market defining transaction. It really moves the needle and validates the work that Afterpay have been doing,"" said Emanuel Datt, founder of Datt Capital which bought Afterpay shares around A$7.00 in 2018 and predicted a buyout this year.

Europe's second-largest insurer after Allianz (DE:ALVG) said it made nearly 4 billion euros of net profit in the first half, more than double the 1.43 billion euros a year earlier.
It said its company-focused Axa XL unit, hit last year by business interruption and event cancellation claims, recorded 619 million euros in underlying income from an 843 million euros loss a year ago.
Axa Chief Executive Thomas Buberl told reporters a turnaround at the unit was showing its first results.
""Taking advantage of the continued favourable pricing momentum, Axa XL is well positioned to deliver its euro 1.2 billion earnings target in 2021"", Buberl also said in a statement. 
Axa's underlying profit rose 93% in the first half to 3.64 billion euros. Excluding last year's COVID-19 related claims, underlying earnings rose by 12%, Axa added.
Shares in Axa were up 3.29% at 0845 GMT, topping France's CAC 40 index.
""Axa's results are a clear beat to consensus expectations, with Axa XL's underlying earnings up +40% (ex-COVID) being a particularly pleasing source of strength"", analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
However, Axa warned that July's devastating floods in Germany and Belgium will cost it around 400 million euros before tax and net of reinsurance in a preliminary estimate.
The company in June reached a 300 million euro settlement with restaurant owners in France over pandemic-related insurance claims.
Chief Financial Officer Alban de Mailly Nesle said nearly half of the restaurant owners involved had expressed interest in the settlement.
""The campaign is going very well on the ground"", de Mailly told reporters.
In a separate statement, Axa said its board of directors had proposed renewing Buberl's mandate as CEO and board member.

The proposal will be put to shareholders in April 2022 at the annual general meeting.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>","HSBC doubles profit, hints at share buybacks as bad loan fears ease","By Alun John and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -HSBC Holdings beat forecasts on Monday with first-half pretax profit that more than doubled from last year when it set aside $7 billion to cover pandemic-related bad loans.
Encouraged by an economic rebound in its two biggest markets of Hong Kong and Britain, HSBC reinstated dividend payments, flagged higher payouts in the future, and released $700 million that had been set aside as provisions. It also said share buybacks were under review as an option after ruling them out earlier this year.
Like rivals, Europe's biggest bank is benefiting from better-than-hoped for resilience on the part of companies grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic. That said, a decline in revenue underscored longer-term challenges.
HSBC reported pretax profit of $10.8 billion, higher than the $4.32 billion in the same period a year earlier and a consensus estimate of $9.45 billion compiled by the bank. 
Revenue fell 4% due to a low interest rate environment especially in Asia, where it makes most of its money, and a weaker performance from its investment bank compared to a strong first half last year. 
Growth should come from managing more wealthy customers' money and shifting investment banking resources from Europe and the United States to Asia, Chief Executive Noel Quinn told Reuters.
""We're still in the early days of the economic rebound, we need to see all those numbers become the trend for the future, we are encouraged but there is more still to go,"" he said.
Quinn said he did not expect any decline in investment appetite for China after regulatory crackdowns have upended norms for the country's tech, property and private tutoring sectors, leaving some overseas investors bruised and uncertain.
""We see strong liquidity seeking investment opportunities in Hong Kong and Asia,"" he said.
In a separate call with analysts, Quinn also said HSBC was targeting bolt-on acquisitions in Asia outside China to expand its wealth management business, adding the bank was ""looking at three or four as we speak"" in areas including insurance and asset management. 
HSBC's shares rose 0.7% in London, in line with a 0.9% gain in the benchmark FTSE index. 
INCOME SQUEEZE
Unlike its competitors, HSBC has failed to benefit from a frenzy in stock listings and tech company fundraisings after opting not to join the current boom in special purpose acquisition company (SPACs) listings.
""It has been a very conscious decision to stay away from SPACs because that sector runs an elevated risk of litigation,"" Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told Reuters.
Revenue for HSBC's investment bank slid 23% in the second quarter against the same period a year ago at a time when Wall Street banks and U.S.-focused rivals such as  Barclays  (LON:BARC) have seen strong performances.
The bank also saw pretax profit from Asia declining 6%, a drop Stevenson said was ""almost entirely driven by the reduction in interest rates"". Both longer and shorter term Hibors, the benchmark lending rates in Hong Kong, were near 10-year lows for much of the quarter.
On a more positive note, HSBC said given the brighter outlook globally as economies recover faster than expected from the pandemic, it expects credit losses to be below its medium-term forecast of 0.3%-0.4% of its loans.
It said that for the year, it might be able to make a net release of funds from earlier provisions rather than add to them, but it was hard to give a definite view due to the unknown impact of government support programmes, vaccine rollouts and new strains of the virus.

It also said it would move to within its target payout range of 40-55% of reported earnings per share within 2021.
HSBC plans to pay an interim dividend of seven cents a share after the Bank of England scrapped payout curbs last month. That compares with its interim dividend of $0.31 per share in pre-pandemic 2019.

Garuda and its lessor, Aercap Ireland Limited, signed a global side letter agreement on July 28 to stop legal proceeding, following Aercap's bankruptcy lawsuit in June at the New South Wales Supreme Court, Garuda said separately in a stock exchange filing. 
The nine aircraft are the total number of jets leased from Aercap, Irfan said in a text message, adding that details of the return were still being discussed with the lessor.
""The company agreed, among other things, to fly and relocate nine leased Boeing B737 800NG aircraft to an approved location,"" the filing issued at the weekend said.
An Aercap spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
Separately, Garuda has been brought to an Indonesian court after failing to pay a debt to an air cargo firm PT My Indo Airlines. 
Garuda has been trying to return surplus planes due to the travel disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, seeking early termination, lease holidays or pay-by-the-hour schemes in a bid to reduce its fleet size and cut costs, company executives told a parliament hearing. [J9N2JW02B]
As of June, Garuda had returned 20 planes to lessors and was negotiating to return more.
Garuda is only flying 41 planes of the 142 in its fleet due to low demand for travel caused by the pandemic. 

The airline had also said it wanted to maintain a workforce in line with the number of planes.
Garuda, which employed more than 7,800 people before the pandemic, has reduced its staff by 2,300 thought offering early retirement and contract terminations.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, helped by strong results from banking giant HSBC and French insurer AXA as well as healthy German retail sales.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.9% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1%.
This quarterly earnings season has generally been positive so far in Europe, and  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA), Europe’s largest bank by assets, continued the theme Monday. The banking giant posted pretax profit for the first half of the year of $10.8 billion, more than double the performance for the same period last year. It also reinstated its dividend payments and released $700 million that had been set aside to cover potential bad loans. Its stock rose 1.2%.
Heineken (OTC:HEINY) stock slipped 0.1% after the world's second-largest brewer beat first-half earnings expectations, but warned of weakness in the rest of the year as costs cut into margins. The Dutch AEX index nonetheless hit a new all-time high, thanks to further strength in chipmaking names ASML and BE Semiconductor, and a rebound in Prosus (OTC:PROSF) stock. 
AXA (PA:AXAF) stock rose 3% after Europe’s second-largest insurer reported an 180% increase in net income in the first half, rebounding from last year's Covid-19 hit.
There was not such good news from Allianz (DE:ALVG), its stock falling 5.4% after the German insurer and asset manager warned of a potential hit as the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation into its Structured Alpha Funds.
Elsewhere, aero-engineer  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT) stock soared 58% after U.S. firm Parker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH) said it would buy the U.K. rival in a deal that values it at 6.3 billion pounds ($8.76 billion).
In economic news, German retail sales rose 4.2% in June, much more than expected following an easing of Covid-19 restrictions, and followed an upwardly revised increase of 4.6% in May. 
German manufacturing PMI data also came in better than expected, rising to 65.9 in July, from 65.1, which bodes well for Europe as a whole as the German economy tends to be the region’s main driver.
Asia markets traded higher Monday, creating a positive handover for Europe, as Chinese equity markets stabilized after last week’s heavy selloff on the back of the crackdown by local regulators on the tech and education sectors. The tone was helped by a call from Chinese regulators for dialogue with their U.S. counterparts over Chinese companies' listings in the U.S.
Elsewhere, oil prices weakened Monday in response to the Chinese factory data slowing sharply in July, suggesting weakening economic growth in the largest crude importer in the world.
At 4:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $73.03 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.2% to $74.53.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,811.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1867.

MUFG, which owns about 20% of Wall Street investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), reported profit of 383.1 billion yen ($3.49 billion) for the three months to June 30, against 183.5 billion yen a year earlier.
The bank retained its full-year profit forecast of 850 billion yen. That compared with an average forecast of 859 billion yen from nine analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
Japanese banks have been struggling with years of ultra-low interest rates and a shrinking population. In the past financial year, three major lenders including MUFG collectively booked 1.1 trillion yen in credit-related costs, which nearly doubled year on year, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
MUFG's credit-related costs in the first quarter came in at 5.1 billion yen, versus 145 billion yen in the same period last year.
The lender had estimated 350 billion yen of credit-related costs for the current financial year which runs through March.
In contrast, net interest income - mainly derived from its traditional lending business - came in at 496.9 billion yen for the quarter, marking a 5.9% on-year rise, as corporate clients rushed to borrow to overcome the pandemic fallout. 

Peers Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group Inc and Mizuho Financial Group Inc last week both reported their net profit for the quarter more than doubled as credit-related costs dropped.

It's a new week, a new month and time for a fresh start - but the problems niggling at markets this morning are still the same.
Chinese stocks' continued rebound after a selloff caused by Beijing's regulatory crackdown lifted markets across Asia. European and U.S. equity futures are also higher thanks companies' second-quarter earnings that are up 120% and 90% respectively year-on-year.
Add to that more fiscal stimulus in the United States where senators unveiled a sweeping $1 trillion infrastructure plan that could pass this week.
But releases of Asia purchasing manager indexes (PMI) show clouds on the horizon; rising input costs and a new wave of coronavirus infection overshadowed solid global demand, highlighting the fragile nature of the region's recovery.
Manufacturing activity rose in export powerhouses Japan and South Korea, but China readings confirm that growth is indeed slowing amid rising costs and extreme weather in the world's second largest economy.
China's central bank pledged over the weekend to maintain a prudent, flexible and targeted monetary policy to support growth while keeping the digital economy in check.
The growth concerns sent oil 1% lower and kept the dollar just above a one-month low.
More PMI readings are due today and Wednesday, but this week's biggest datapoint is Friday's U.S. payrolls --- the last major jobs reading available to the Fed before its Jackson Hole summit, where many expect it to say when it will start tapering bond-buying.
Then there are geopolitical tensions. The United States and Britain have pointed the finger at Iran, blaming it for last week's attack on an Israeli-managed petroleum product tanker that killed two people.
Back on the earnings front, HSBC continues the run of forecast-beating Q2 numbers, reporting first-half pretax profit that more than doubled from last year when it made huge provisions for pandemic-related bad loans.
Heineken (OTC:HEINY), the world's second-largest brewer, reported first-half earnings above expectations but said the rest of the year could be less rosy given cost pressures and COVID-19.
Finally, the U.S. debt ceiling suspension expired on the weekend, forcing the Treasury into extraordinary measures to get by. Later on Monday, it will announce its overall refunding plans.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Monday, helped by a degree of stability in Asia overnight and strong results from banking giant HSBC.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
Asia markets traded higher Monday, creating a positive handover for Europe, as Chinese equity markets stabilizing after last week’s heavy selloff on the back of the crackdown by local regulators on the tech and education sectors. The tone was helped by a call from Chinese regulators for dialogue with their U.S. counterparts over Chinese companies' listings in the U.S.
However, China’s factory activity growth slowed sharply in July, with the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers’ index falling to 50.3, its lowest level since April 2020.
Also helping the tone Monday were strong quarterly results from HSBC (LON:HSBA), Europe’s largest bank by assets. The banking giant’s pretax profit for the first half of the year came in at $10.8 billion, more than double the performance for the same period last year. It also reinstated its dividend payments and released $700 million that had been set aside to cover potential bad loans.
Elsewhere, Heineken (OTC:HEINY), the world's second-largest brewer, beat first-half earnings expectations, but warned of weakness in the rest of the year as costs eat into margins.
AXA (PA:AXAF) reported an 180% increase in net income in the first half, as Europe’s second-largest insurer rebounded from last year's Covid-19 hit.
In economic news, German retail sales rose 4.2% in June, a slowdown from a revised rate of 4.6% the previous month, but most attention will be on manufacturing PMI data for the European region as a whole which could show a slowdown.
Across the Atlantic, the July U.S. jobs report on Friday will be the main economic release this week, as this could influence the U.S. Federal Reserve’s thinking over when to start reducing its bond purchases. Fed board member Lael Brainard restated the central bank's focus on further labor market progress at the weekend.
Elsewhere, oil prices weakened Monday in response to the Chinese factory data.

No formal announcement about the pay raise has been made and it was unclear which other levels of employees at the investment banking division have also been given salary increases, the report from the financial and business news website said.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Investment banks have raised pay for first- and second-year associates this summer in an attempt to ease the strain on these workers and compensate them more for their work supporting more senior staff in a year of unprecedented deal making. 
Citi Group,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) and Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) have already increased pay for their first-year analysts to around $100,000, a raise of about $15,000.

In February, a group of junior bankers in Goldman's investment bank told senior management they were working nearly 100 hours a week and sleeping 5 hours a night to keep up with an over-the-top workload and ""unrealistic deadlines."" Half of the group, which consisted of 13 first-year employees, said they were likely to quit by summer unless conditions improved.
Goldman's Chief Executive Officer David Solomon has said the bank was working to hire more associates to help with the workload, and vowed to enforce the ""Saturday rule,"" which prohibits employees from working between 9 p.m. Friday night and 9 a.m. on Sunday, except in certain circumstances.

However, U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci warned that ""things are going to get worse,” even as he added that the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines could mean that a return to the lockdowns seen in 2020 is unlikely.
Investors remained cautiously optimistic.

Shares of Evergrande declined more than 2% in early trading on Monday on continued worries over its financial health, while HengTen jumped more than 30%. Shares of HengTen resumed trading on Monday after a suspension on Thursday. 
Worries over the developer's debt and the potential for systemic financial risk have intensified after Evergrande said in June its project companies had not paid some commercial paper on time, but it said it was arranging payment.
Fitch downgraded its credit rating on Wednesday, signalling its concern of a potential default.
To ease the pressure, Evergrande will sell a 7% stake at HK$3.20 per share to a unit of Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. for HK$2.07 billion and a 4% stake to an unidentified buyer for HK$1.18 billion. The filing did not give a timing for the sale.
Before the transaction, Evergrande held a 37.55% stake in the company, while Tencent held 16.9%.

(Reuters) - German-Australian start-up Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd said on Monday it has signed a deal to supply lithium to  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY), the latest move by an electric vehicle maker to lock down supply of the battery metal ahead of a projected surge in demand.
Vulcan will supply 6,000 to 17,000 tonnes of lithium annually to the French automaker from its geothermal brine deposits in Germany starting in 2026, the companies said. The five-year deal is renewable if both parties agree. 
Renault (PA:RENA), with brands including Alpine and Dacia, has said it would like 90% of Renault models to be fully electric by 2030. The company said Vulcan's geothermal lithium production process, which has no carbon emissions, was the main appeal.
Vulcan plans to invest 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) to build geothermal power stations and facilities to extract lithium, with a goal to start production of the white metal in 2024.
Geothermal projects typically involve extracting super-hot lithium-rich brine from underground reservoirs and using the heat to produce electricity, after which lithium is extracted from the brine.
The brine is then reinjected into the earth, making the process more sustainable than open-pit mines and brine evaporation ponds, the two most-common existing methods to produce the white metal.
Vulcan is backed in part by Hancock Prospecting, led by Executive Chairman Gina Rinehart, one of Australia's leading investors. 

Vulcan last month signed a long-term deal to sell lithium hydroxide from its German project to the battery unit of South Korea's LG Chem. 
Vulcan has also signed a memorandum of understanding for lithium supply with Stellantis NV, the world's forth-largest automaker.

1096,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2021 05:05PM ET</span>",Vonovia to make new Deutsche Wohnen offer at 53 eur/shr,"By Arno Schuetze and Matthias Inverardi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -German real estate company Vonovia is launching a fresh attempt to buy rival Deutsche Wohnen (OTC:DTCWY) with a sweetened bid valuing the company at 19.1 billion euro ($22.7 billion), it said on Sunday.
Vonovia is planning to submit a new offer at 53 euros per Deutsche Wohnen share, subject to approval by German financial watchdog BaFin. Last month, Vonovia narrowly missed the 50% threshold with its agreed bid worth 52 euros a share.
The country's biggest merger this year would create a European real estate giant with 550,000 apartments whose combined book value stands at more than 80 billion euros. It comes as Deutsche Wohnen has become the focus of popular anger in Berlin over tenant rights and affordable housing.
Since the failure of its offer last month, Vonovia has secured just below 30% of the shares in its rival, some of them by buying treasury shares at 52 euros apiece. It now needs a Bafin waiver - which is seen as a formality - to immediately file a new offer and not wait for a year with a new bid.
Vonovia is keeping key terms of the transaction unchanged, including the minimum acceptance threshold of 50%. 
But according to the new offer Vonovia will not strike a domination agreement with Deutsche Wohnen for three years, giving hedge funds an incentive to tender their shares quickly.
""With that, we kill the speculative element"", Vonovia Chief Executive Rolf Buch told Reuters, adding Vonovia introduced an additional clause that provides shareholders get their money sooner if they tender their shares quickly.
The offer announced in May failed as some shareholders declined to tender their shares on a view it undervalued Deutsche Wohnen. 
Separately, a number of hedge funds tendered none or only a small amount of their holdings in anticipation of getting more for their shares at a later stage.
Under German law, any acquirer can strike a so-called domination agreement once it crosses a 75% share ownership threshold, allowing it control of the target company's cashflows. The acquirer must, however, in that case offer compensation to holdouts that is typically above the original offer price.
""We have taken the speculative elements out of the deal structure"", Buch said, referring to the fact that no such domination agreement is planned for three years. 
An initial attempt in 2016 by Vonovia to buy Deutsche Wohnen failed on resistance by the target, but this time Deutsche Wohnen's CEO favours the deal, which Deutsche Wohnen reiterated was still the case on Sunday.
The merger plans of Germany's two biggest listed landlords are controversial in Germany because of tensions over soaring rents ahead of general elections in September. Executives have promised the merged company would work with politicians to provide affordable housing.

""We stand by our commitments as a reliable political partner to use our combined strength to tackle the challenges of the housing market"", Buch said.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2021 03:00PM ET</span>","Zoom reaches $85 million settlement over user privacy, 'Zoombombing'","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -Zoom Video Communications Inc agreed to pay $85 million and bolster its security practices to settle a lawsuit claiming it violated users' privacy rights by sharing personal data with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and LinkedIn, and letting hackers disrupt Zoom meetings in a practice called Zoombombing.
A preliminary settlement filed on Saturday afternoon requires approval by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California.
Subscribers in the proposed class action would be eligible for 15% refunds on their core subscriptions or $25, whichever is larger, while others could receive up to $15.
Zoom agreed to security measures including alerting users when meeting hosts or other participants use third-party apps in meetings, and to provide specialized training to employees on privacy and data handling.
The San Jose-based company denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.
In a statement on Sunday, Zoom said: ""The privacy and security of our users are top priorities for Zoom, and we take seriously the trust our users place in us.""
Saturday's settlement came after Koh on March 11 let the plaintiffs pursue some contract-based claims.
Though Zoom collected about $1.3 billion in Zoom Meetings subscriptions from class members, the plaintiffs' lawyers called the $85 million settlement reasonable given the litigation risks. They intend to seek up to $21.25 million for legal fees.
Zoombombing is where outsiders hijack Zoom meetings and display pornography, use racist language or post other disturbing content.
Koh said Zoom was ""mostly"" immune for Zoombombing under Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability over user content.
Zoom's customer base has grown sixfold since the COVID-19 pandemic forced more people to work from home.

The company had 497,000 customers with more than 10 employees in April 2021, up from 81,900 in January 2020. It has said user growth could slow or decline as more people get vaccines and return to work or school in-person.

Pension funds for truck drivers, teachers and subway workers have lodged lawsuits in the United States against Allianz Global Investors, one of the world’s top asset managers, for failing to safeguard their investments during financial market instability during the coronavirus pandemic.
Market panic around the virus resulted in billions of dollars in losses last year, hitting many investors, but no other top-tier asset manager is facing such a large number of lawsuits in the United States connected to the turbulence.
Allianz said that its Allianz Global Investors unit has received a voluntary request for documents and information from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and that Allianz is fully cooperating with the DOJ as well as with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Allianz' management has reassessed the matter and come to the conclusion that there is a relevant risk that the Structured Alpha Funds issue could materially impact future financial results of Allianz, it added.
For now, it was not feasible to reliably estimate the amount of any possible resolution including potential fines and no provision has been recognised at the current stage, the insurer said.
The U.S. lawsuits allege that Allianz Global Investors, in its Structured Alpha family of funds, strayed from a strategy of using options to protect against a short-term financial market crash.

Last year, Allianz was forced to shut two private hedge funds after severe losses, prompting the wave of litigation which the company has said is ""legally and factually flawed"".
Together, the various suits filed in the U.S. Southern District of New York claim investors lost a total of around $4 billion.

OSHKOSH, Wis (Reuters) - The wings of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX airliner swept over green fields populated by colorful small planes, lending a rare corporate touch to the world's largest grassroots air show this past week.
EAA AirVenture brought together more than half a million aviation enthusiasts and thousands of vintage or homebuilt aircraft and aerobatic showstoppers to Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK), Wisconsin, for a celebration dubbed the Woodstock of aviation.
For one week, the annual summer event becomes the world's busiest airspace with well over 100 takeoffs or landings every hour.
With marquee events like the Paris Airshow cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, Oshkosh provided a tempting showcase this year for corporate industry leaders like Boeing and United Airlines - a reminder of what's at stake for an industry still overcoming its worst crisis.
A year ago U.S. airlines were grappling with a pilot surplus. Now as travel demand snaps back more quickly than expected, they are rushing to fill hiring pipelines and woo youth to the industry, a change from the slow pace of recovery from previous crises.
""If you had told me last year that I'd be in this event, that I'd have an avenue to get to United Airlines, I would have told you, you were crazy,"" said John Pama, a 21-year old graduate of Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University.
Pama was among 30 prospective young pilots United flew into Oshkosh on a brand-new 737 MAX brandishing the ""Aviate"" logo for its pilot recruitment program.
The airline plans to hire 350 pilots this year, 1,500 by 2022 and 3,000 by 2023.
The Boeing 737, dwarfed by its larger 777 cousin at airports like United's Chicago O'Hare, stood out against the sea of small planes dotted about the Wisconsin countryside, many with pitched tents under their wings where spectators stay for the week-long event.
Elsewhere at the show, Boeing joined forces with rival Airbus for a presentation on efforts to prevent the spread of viruses like COVID-19 during flight.
Yet unlike the prominence given to corporate messaging at the more widely noticed air shows in Paris and Farnborough, England, only a handful of people attended.
By contrast, packed forums nearby featured experts discussing topics for small planes such as ""How healthy is your engine,"" all while war birds and stunt planes zipped above.
The jamboree, which was itself canceled last year because of the pandemic, wraps up Sunday after what organizers expect will be record attendance, despite a sharp decline in international visitors due to continued COVID-19 travel restrictions.
""The crowd this year is an overwhelmingly U.S. domestic audience,"" said Dick Knapinski, spokesman of the show's organizers the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA).

The statement does not make clear where the project, called EV City, will be located.
The design and construction tendering process will be during the 2011/22 fiscal year, said KPA's General Manager Yousef al-Abdullah al-Sabah.

""KPA is able to provide all port and logistics services to the biggest global companies manufacturing electric cars,"" Sabah said, adding that the project was in line with Kuwait's Vision 2035 economic diversification plan.

Morrisons rejected an unsolicited 5.52 billion pound ($7.68 billion) proposal from CD&R in June and this month backed a 6.3 billion pound offer from a group led by SoftBank Group Corp-owned Fortress.
The Sunday Times said CD&R was understood to have been preparing equity and debt financing for a counter bid which could come in the next few days.
If successful, CD&R would open Morrisons convenience stores at fuel stations operated by Motor Fuel Group, which CD&R owns, and it would work alongside the existing Morrisons' management team, the Sunday Times said.
Britain's Takeover Panel, which regulates corporate transactions, said last month it had given CD&R until Aug. 9 to announce a firm intention to make an offer or walk away.
A spokesman for CD&R declined to comment on the Sunday Times report.
Last week, British money manager M&G, which owns a 1.08% stake in Morrisons, joined criticism of the Fortress-led bid, saying it did not reflect the true value of the company.
Morrisons' largest shareholder Silchester has also said it is not inclined to support the offer for Britain's fourth-largest supermarket chain.  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Plc, also an investor in Morrisons, is still considering how it will vote. 
A third private equity suitor Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) said last month it would not pursue a solo offer for Morrisons but could join the Fortress consortium.

Shareholders in Morrisons are due to vote on the Fortress offer on Aug. 16.

The potential bid process is being managed by UK Government Investments, the paper reported https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/07/31/olympics-broadcaster-lines-bid-channel-4, adding that a deal was not expected to be completed until the middle of next year.
Discovery did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Britain's government on July 6 announced a consultation on the sale of Channel 4, and it was considering changes to the operating model of the broadcaster, including its ownership, remit and obligations.
The advertising-funded Channel 4, whose hit shows include ""The Great British Bake Off,"" was set up with a remit to provide challenging and distinctive programming for audiences under-served by traditional broadcasters.

Rival UK broadcasters  ITV  (LON:ITV) Plc and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Sky are also exploring a bid for Channel 4, Telegraph reported.
In its 2020 annual report, Channel 4 said its revenues were 934 million pounds, down 5% from 2019, with a pre-tax surplus of 74 million pounds, the highest in its 38-year history. Viewing share for its TV channel portfolio rose 2% to 10.1%, its first year-on-year increase since 2011. It set a target of doubling viewing by 2025.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement that it had taken note of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) new requirements for disclosure regarding Chinese companies' listings and that the two sides should ""uphold the spirit of mutual respect"" and ""strengthen communications on regulating China-related stocks.""
The CSRC has always been open to companies choosing where to go public and ""China's basic national policy of advancing reform and opening up is unswerving, and the financial opening to the outside world will continue,"" it said on its website.
The SEC said on Friday it would require Chinese companies to disclose ""uncertainty about future actions by the government of China that could significantly affect the operating company's financial performance,"" before allowing them to raise capital through U.S. stock markets.
Chinese issuers must also disclose if they were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges and the risks that such approval could be denied or rescinded, the SEC added.
China has been tightening its regulatory grip on overseas share issuance after it launched a cybersecurity probe of ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc last month, just days after its listing in New York.

China's cabinet said on July 6 that it would strengthen supervision of all Chinese firms listed offshore.
Following suit, China's cyberspace regulator said that any company with data for more than 1 million users must report for a cybersecurity review before seeking overseas listings. China's central bank has also said that non-bank payment firms must report plans for overseas listings.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 08:05PM ET</span>",Airbus production plans expose strategy rift with engine makers,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -A rift between Airbus and engine makers over plans for higher jet output blotted strong aerospace earnings this week, with worries over the supply chain's industrial capacity masking a deeper tug of war over contrasting business strategies.
With travel demand snapping back in key U.S. and Chinese markets, Airbus wants to almost double jet production in a few years as it capitalises on a bulging order book for new jets and the recent woes of embattled U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).
In May, it issued a mix of firm targets and scenarios that could lift narrowbody output to 75 jets a month by 2025 from 40 now, and 60 before the COVID pandemic.
That has rattled engine makers and others who fear the world's largest planemaker will upset their own recovery by flooding markets with new jets too quickly, forcing existing ones straight into retirement rather than their repair shops.
""The engine makers look at the production plans and see them displacing older airplanes that are still profitable for them,"" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.
The standoff could accelerate efforts by engine makers to adapt their service-dependent business models by charging more upfront for their engines, Aboulafia said. 
Doing so is potentially risky since planemakers also eye a bigger slice of their suppliers' service revenues. 
Public differences over production can unsettle the whole supply chain, reducing the appetite for risk, suppliers say.
Few quibble with a smooth return towards pre-crisis levels for in-demand narrowbody jets, through Boeing remains more cautious as it emerges from a separate crisis over its 737 MAX.
""They (planemakers) can feel the momentum coming back,"" the head of the world's largest engine maker GE Aviation, John Slattery, told a Eurocontrol podcast, while pledging to support a return to pre-crisis levels by early 2023 for narrowbodies.
But industry sources say GE's French engine partner  Safran  (PA:SAF) was speaking for many suppliers when it questioned plans to take output swiftly beyond that to uncharted levels.
""I have to say we are not sure that the market has the appetite for such rates and that rates well above 60 can be sustainable,"" Safran CEO Olivier Andries told analysts on Wednesday, echoing previous warnings against over-production.
Also speaking to analysts at mid-year results, Greg Hayes, CEO of Pratt & Whitney parent Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), expressed surprise at ""pretty aggressive"" Airbus output plans.
Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury defended the plans, saying he was ready to ""do the math"" with suppliers based on solid orders. ""I'm really disappointed to see that some usual partners are still challenging the rates,"" he told analysts.
In public, the debate revolves around the resilience of both demand and a weakened supply chain.
Behind the scenes, the argument aggravates differences that have been simmering for years, some industry sources said.
""There is a legitimate point to make about the industrial worries and appetite for risk among lower-tier suppliers. But it is also legitimate to say that engine makers have to get work out of airplanes already in service,"" one industry source said.
SPLIT BUSINESS MODELS
Both jetmakers and engine makers have reaped a bonanza from demand for popular narrowbodies used by low-cost carriers, but the way they recoup their investments is generally different.
While planemakers get paid on delivery of new jets, allowing them to absorb fixed costs fairly quickly, engine makers rely on servicing older jets and have to wait years to make money back.
Until now, a strong economy left room for both models and supported record new jet orders while keeping older planes flying long enough to generate lucrative service visits.
But Airbus' plans have triggered disagreement over how the burden of the crisis should be shared. Engine makers already face delays in future parts revenues, because the maintenance clock has paused on thousands of jets idled during the crisis.
""It is rather surprising to see production going to the highest levels ever seen while the number of stored airplanes is also at the highest level ever seen,"" one industry source said.
CFM, a GE-Safran venture which powers all Boeing and some Airbus narrowbody jets, and Pratt & Whitney, which competes with CFM on Airbus jets, have voiced private concerns over the long-term impact of the plans, industry sources said.
CFM, Pratt & Whitney and Airbus declined to comment.
As sole supplier on the 737 MAX, which was hit by a recent safety crisis, CFM will also be wary of the signal it sends to the U.S. company if it helps Airbus assume too flamboyant a lead in the market with its A320neo family, one industry source said.
Planemakers say they are the primary risk takers and argue the whole industry has feasted off demand for their products. 
They argue that although engine makers see their margins diluted in the short-term by delivering engines for little or no immediate cash, they reap high margins on later repairs.
Tensions over production are just one threat to a fragile balance between business models in the $150 billion jet sector.
Airlines are also under pressure to retire jets sooner for environmental reasons, sometimes in return for COVID bailouts. That too could reduce the number of prized engine overhauls.
A trend towards shorter lifespans was revealed in recent climate reports from Airbus and Boeing, calculating emissions from their jets based on a life around 22 years.
That's lower than the mantra of 25 years underpinning a growing air finance industry and has potential implications for aircraft prices, leasing profits and future airplane orders.

""The market is going to dictate how many engines the engine makers will produce,"" Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said in a recent interview.
""Ultimately I think you are seeing a convergence in the number of engines and airframes being produced.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday and registered losses for the week as Amazon.com shares dropped after the company forecast lower sales growth, but the S&P 500 still notched a sixth straight month of gains.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares sank 7.6% - their biggest daily percentage drop since May 2020 - after the company reported late on Thursday revenue for the second quarter that was shy of analysts' average estimate and said sales growth would ease in the next few quarters as customers ventured more outside the home.
Shares of other internet and tech giants that did well during the lockdowns of last year, including Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), were mostly lower as well.
""Overall earnings have been good. But Amazon ... and some of last year's winners are taking some of the air out of the market today,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""This market has been driven by big tech and when tech does well, the market seems to go right along with it, and when it doesn't,"" it falls.
Data on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending rose more than expected in June, although annual inflation accelerated further above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 149.06 points, or 0.42%, to 34,935.47, the S&P 500 lost 23.89 points, or 0.54%, to 4,395.26 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 105.59 points, or 0.71%, to 14,672.68.
For the month, the S&P 500 rose 2.3%, the Dow gained 1.3% and the Nasdaq added 1.2%, while for the week all three of the major indexes posted declines.
Strong earnings and the continued rebound in the U.S. economy have helped to support stocks this month, but the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus and rising inflation have been concerns.
""There are still some distant jitters, whispers about the Delta variant, about cases rising, and I think some underlying worries about a slowdown of the reopenings and possible reversal,"" Dollarhide said.
Also on the earnings front, Pampers maker Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co rose 2% as it forecast higher core earnings for this year, and U.S.-listed shares of Canada's Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc jumped 5.1% after the Burger King owner beat estimates for quarterly profit.
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc, however, plunged 18.2% after saying U.S. user growth was decelerating as people who used the platform for crafts and DIY projects during the height of the pandemic were stepping out more.
 Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) shares also fell, ending down 2.7%, even though the company posted a rise in second-quarter adjusted profit on the back of a recovery in global economic activity.
S&P 500 company results on the quarter overall have been much stronger than expected, with about 89% of the nearly 300 reports so far beating analysts' profit estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Earnings are now expected to have climbed 89.8% in the second quarter versus forecasts of 65.4% at the start of July.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.86 billion shares, compared with the 9.74 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 65 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 84 new highs and 98 new lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Peru's currency tumbled to a record low on its largest daily decline in over seven years after new President Pedro Castillo appointed a member of his Marxist party as prime minister and did not yet name a finance minister, leaving the direction of policy and the economy uncertain.
The appointment of Guido Bellido as premier dimmed investor hopes for a moderate administration and sent bond prices lower, with spreads to safe-haven U.S. Treasuries at their widest in over a year.
The 2060 bond issue was down 2 cents on the dollar to trade at 88.3 cents, the 2032 bond fell 1 cent and its century bond was down 2.8 cents, Refinitiv data showed.
The local stock index dropped almost 6% at its session low and posted its lowest close since November. On Wall Street, stocks of Peru based financials Credicorp (NYSE:BAP) and Intercorp Financial Services (NYSE:IFS) fell 16.3% and 10.1% respectively, while miner Buenaventura dropped 5.6%.
The local sol currency lost 3.6% to the greenback to set a record closing low of 4.068 per U.S. dollar.
The decline was the largest for any day in over seven years despite $293 million sold by the central bank to protect the sol. 
Peru's currency is ""likely to stay under pressure as the political process plays out,"" said Citi analysts in a note. ""We expect the central bank to intervene to smooth volatility.""
Bellido's appointment on Thursday indicated the influence that the far-left Free Peru party may have in Castillo's administration, set to last until 2026.
""It's probably too early to make conclusions, but the opening gambit isn't a positive one,"" said Sailesh Lad at Axa Investment Managers. 
""We think there is going to be volatility, but I don't think panic has set in and we are at the stage where (investors) need to exit the country,"" Lad said. ""At the same time, we haven't reached the stage where we see opportunities."" 
Spreads of Peru's hard currency bonds over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) EMBI Global Diversified index have risen nearly 30 basis points in the last week to 200 bps - the widest gap since May 2020.
Castillo's failure to appoint a finance minister exacerbated investor concerns, JPMorgan said in a note.
""The extremely atypical political situation reinforces our call for a persistent scenario characterized by political, institutional, and economic uncertainty,"" the bank's Diego W. Pereira wrote.
The cost of insurance against a default in Peru's dollar debt rose to its highest in over a year, breaching 102 basis points from 84 earlier this week.
Castillo swore in most of his cabinet on Thursday evening, but the favorite for the finance job, moderate leftist economist Pedro Francke, left the venue shortly before the ceremony started, raising questions over whether he had rejected or lost the job at the last minute.
Castillo, who faces a balancing act between maintaining the faith of investors and improving life for the largely rural base that voted for him, has said he wants to raise taxes on mining companies to fund health and education reforms.
""A possible constitutional change – and therefore its final outcome – is likely to hamper long-term investment as firms should remain cautious,"" said Andre Loes, economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

""What is left to support growth is the external backdrop, which should remain solid, except for copper, Peru's main export item, whose prices are likely to drop due to lower demand.""
Peru is the world's second-largest copper producer. Its 2022 fiscal deficit targets are likely to be revised higher, with about $4 billion of external bond issuance expected in the second half of 2021, Sebastian Vargas at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a note.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks dropped on Friday to pull further from record highs as an underwhelming earnings report from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dampened the market mood, while the dollar bounced from its lows but still suffered its worst week in nearly two months.
After making record profits during the pandemic, Amazon said late on Thursday that its sales growth would slow in the next few quarters as people ventured outside their homes post-pandemic and reduced online shopping.
Investors sold Amazon stock as the online retailer revenue of $113 billion in the second quarter was $2 billion shy of analysts' forecasts.
Amazon shares slumped 7.6%, dragging the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite down 0.7%. That fed profit-taking elsewhere, with the S&P 500 losing 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.4%. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow struck record highs on Thursday.
""Amazon's weak report and the impact on futures immediately made its impact felt on global markets,"" said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, LLC. 
But Hickey also said: ""Just because investors haven't reacted to the company's recent reports with excitement doesn't mean Amazon has been a poor performer,"" adding that the shares have climbed 17% in the past year.
Still, Amazon's warning of slowing growth gave investors a reason to cash in profits.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.45% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the world shed 0.74%.

The dollar, which hit a one-month low on Thursday, bounced following remarks by St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard that the Fed should start reducing its monthly bond purchases this fall.
The dollar index rose 0.275%, and a firmer greenback pushed the euro down 0.23% to $1.1859. [USD/]

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian billionaire Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's plan to launch an ultra-low-cost airline, could give planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) a chance to regain lost ground in India after the fall of one of its biggest customers, Jet Airways, two years ago, industry executives say.
Jhunjhunwala, known as ""India's Warren Buffett"" for his successful stock investments, plans to team up with former CEOs of IndiGo, the country's biggest carrier, and Jet Airways to tap into demand for domestic air travel.
While Jhunjhunwala's Akasa Air comes at a time when India's aviation industry is reeling from the impact of the pandemic, with airlines losing billions of dollars, the sector's long-term prospect makes it a hot market for planemakers Boeing and Airbus.
""There will be a big fight between Airbus and Boeing,"" said Nitin Sarin, managing partner at law firm Sarin & Co, which advises lessors and airlines. 
""For Boeing this is a great opportunity to step in and up their game, considering they don't have any other major operator for their 737 aircraft in India apart from SpiceJet,"" Sarin said, referring to Boeing's narrowbody aircraft.
One industry source said the new venture was already moving towards what could be one of the biggest deals of the year outside the United States to acquire purchased or leased 737s.
Boeing did not comment on Akasa's plans, but said it always seeks opportunities and talks to current and potential customers about how it can best support their fleet and operational needs. 
Details of the venture, including any decision on plane orders, have not been formally disclosed, but Jhunjhunwala told Bloomberg he plans to have a 40% stake in Akasa, which will have 70 aircraft of up to 180 seats within four years. 
Jhunjhunwala, valued at $4.6 billion by Forbes, did not respond to an interview request. 
Indian skies are dominated by low-cost carriers (LCCs) including IndiGo, SpiceJet, GoFirst and AirAsia India, with the majority of them operating a fleet of Airbus' narrowbody planes.
Boeing dominates India's widebody market of 51 planes but fare wars and high costs have led to casualties among full-service carriers, including  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines in 2012 and Jet Airways in 2019, making LCCs and Airbus even more dominant. 
Boeing's share of India's 570 narrowbody planes fell to 18% after Jet's demise from 35% in 2018, data from consultancy CAPA India shows. Jet was recently rescued from bankruptcy and is expected to fly again.
Indian carriers have over 900 planes on order of which 185 are Boeing 737 aircraft and 710 are Airbus, which counts IndiGo as one of its biggest customers globally.
""If you have to lease an aircraft there is an abundance and lessors would be happy to provide competitive rates, even better than pre-COVID times,"" Sarin said. 
He warned, however, that India is still a difficult place to do business, with regulatory hurdles and expensive and under-developed airports making LCCs less efficient than elsewhere.
Even as Akasa faces tough competition in a battered, post-COVID market which has pushed airlines to renegotiate terms with lessors and vendors, raise fresh funds and trim costs, starting with a clean slate and good capital will give it an advantage.

Akasa's other co-founders are Aditya Ghosh, who spent a decade with IndiGo and was credited with its early success, and Vinay Dube, former CEO of Jet who has also worked with Delta. 
""It will be a long haul and the new airline will be very severely tested but the capitalisation and the start team gives confidence that it is possible for them to be successful,"" CAPA India head Kapil Kaul said.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 04:25PM ET</span>",Robinhood turns higher on day after weak debut; Cathie Wood's Ark buys 1.3 million shares,"(Reuters) -Shares of  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) closed higher Friday, a day after the ARK Innovation ETF, managed by star stock picker Cathie Wood, said it picked up 1.3 million shares of the online brokerage during its grim market debut.
Robinhood’s shares closed up just shy of 1% at $35.15, after falling earlier in the session and losing more than 8% in its Thursday debut. Market watchers cited a comparatively cold reception from retail investors who have fueled rallies in shares of so-called “meme stocks,” as well as Robinhood's decision to reserve as much as 35% of its shares for its users.
The stock remained below its initial public offering price of $38 a share. 
That poor showing has not dissuaded Wood, who gained fame on the strong performance of her funds in 2020. According to ARK's daily update for its actively managed ETFs on Thursday, it bought 1,297,615 shares of Robinhood in its ARK Innovation ETF. At Thursday’s closing price, that would have been worth around $45.2 million. 
The Ark Innovation ETF owned 3,623,092 shares of Robinhood as of Friday, making up 0.55% of the fund's portfolio and worth $126 million, according to data on the fund's website.
Ark did not immediately respond to request for comment
Other investors stayed on the sidelines, citing concerns about valuation, the risk of regulation and lingering anger with the company's imposition of trading curbs during the meme stock trading frenzy in January.
“Calls itself Robinhood, steals from the people. Gotta love it,” said one user on Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets, where retail investors have gathered this year to coordinate buying that has helped drive big rallies in Gamestop, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings and other names. 
Retail investors bought a net $18.85 million of Robinhood stock on Thursday, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research, a relatively low amount compared with other initial public offerings, the firm said. Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc saw retail investors buy $69 million on its debut, while Bitcoin exchange Coinbase took up more than $57 million earlier this year. 

Data from Fidelity Investments showed customers on its brokerage platform placed 31,736 buy orders for Robinhood's stock and 7,451 sell orders on Thursday. 
In an unusual move, Robinhood had said it would reserve between 20% and 35% of its shares for its users. The company warned in its IPO registration that the participation of retail investors could trigger a rollercoaster ride in its shares that could prove too risky for those seeking long-term sustainable gains.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped Friday, paced by a decline in energy and Amazon-led weakness in tech stocks.
The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.4%, and the Nasdaq fell  0.7%.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) slumped 7.5% for the day, after reporting weaker-than-expected guidance and second-quarter revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates.
Revenue was held back by “customers spending less time in the home as restrictions and lockdowns eased in some of the company’s largest markets,” Wedbush said. “Initial Q3:21 guidance was for revenue of $106.0 – $112.0 billion, well below our $119.5 billion estimate and the consensus estimate of $118.9 billion.”
Other megacap tech stocks, with exception of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), failed to pick up the slack as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were in the red.
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) slumped 18% after its better-than-expected earnings and revenue were overshadowed by monthly active numbers that missed Wall Street estimates.
Global monthly active users, or MAUs, rose 9% to 454 million, missing estimates of 484.4 million, while U.S. MAUs slipped 5% to 91M million, below estimates of 96.1 million.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), a major Dow component, slipped 3% even as the industrial equipment maker reported quarterly results that topped analysts estimates.
Energy also played a role in the broader market selloff, down more than 2%, as oil majors  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) fell despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly results.
Still, the quarterly earnings season so far has mostly surprised to the upside, with earnings on track for the highest annual growth since 2009.
About 59% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported results, according to FactSet. “The index is currently reporting the highest year-over-year growth in earnings since Q4 2009,” it added.
Sentiment on the broader market has also been sourced by fresh fears about the impact of the delta variant on the recovery.
“An internal CDC report leaked to the public claims that the Delta variant of COVID-19 is as infectious as chickenpox and can cause more serious illness. The document also suggests that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may be able to transmit the disease at near the same rate,” DA Davidson said in a note.
In other news, Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), up about 3%, clawed back some its losses following its 8.4% slump on its trading debut on Thursday."

Consider These 4 High-Yield Tech Stocks,"Amid rising concerns regarding the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, which could precipitate a market correction, dividend-paying companies are ideal for hedging that risk. Also, given the tech industry’s solid growth prospects, betting on dividend-paying tech stocks could be even more rewarding. Therefore, we think tech stocks International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Seagate (STX), Hewlett Packard (HPE), and Xerox (NYSE:XRX), which deliver high dividend yields, could prove to be valuable additions to one’s portfolio now. Read on.Dividend stocks have been regaining momentum recently because investors have been hedging their portfolios against a decelerating economic recovery and surging market volatility by seeking holdings that deliver steady income streams. This is evidenced by iShares Select Dividend ETF’s (DVY) 2% gains over the past five days versus the benchmark S&P 500 index’s 0.9% returns.
Despite major indexes hitting their all-time highs over the past two weeks, rising investor concerns regarding the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, and consequent re-imposition of mask mandates and potentially other restrictions in the United States, have increased market volatility significantly. The CBOE Volatility index has gained 14.3% over the past month. Furthermore, the decelerating economic recovery is evidenced by the disappointing 6.5% GDP growth rate in the second quarter. It is nearly two percentage points short of the Dow Jones 8.4% consensus estimate. With the Fed recently reiterating its near-zero interest rate stance, high-yielding dividend stocks could be ideal investment bets for income investors. Furthermore, tech stocks are expected to perform well amid rising COVID-19 related concerns as companies continue to operate through remote structures.
Given this backdrop, we believe high-yield tech stocks International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ), Seagate Technology Holdings plc (STX), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), and Xerox Holdings Corporation (XRX), with stable dividend payout histories, should be the good bets now.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 03:51PM ET</span>","Monte dei Paschi capital would be wiped out by slump, EU bank stress test shows","By Huw Jones, Valentina Za and Jesús Aguado
LONDON (Reuters) -All of Monte dei Paschi's capital would be wiped out by a long slump, a European Union stress test of banks showed on Friday, as the Italian lender headed for government-sponsored merger talks with domestic peer UniCredit.
The exercise by the European Banking Authority showed that EU banks took a 265 billion euro ($314.7 billion) hit in a test of their resilience to economic shocks, which still left them with two-thirds of their buffers intact.
The EBA tested the resilience of 50 top lenders to economic shocks, though there is no formal pass or fail mark. The banks account for 70% of EU banking assets. 
Under the harshest scenario spanning three years to 2023, which baked in a prolonged fallout from COVID, the aggregate core ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets fell by nearly 500 basis points, pushing the ratio down to 10.2% from 15%.
Monte dei Paschi, however, ended the test with a core capital ratio of minus 0.1% under the adverse scenario, the worst performer. UniCredit came in at 9.59%.
Monte dei Paschi said it would have had a core ratio of 6.6% after its proposed 2.5 billion euro capital increase. The bank had also fared worst in the EU's stress test five years ago, in a sign of how deep-rooted problems at the world's oldest bank have yet to be sorted out.
None of the other Italian banks tested - Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), Banco BPM and Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) - reached the 10% sector aggregate though several were very close.
HSBC's French arm was the next worse performer after Monte dei Paschi, with a score of 5.91%. HSBC agreed last month to sell it to Cerberus-backed My Money Group.
Sweden's banks were all above 10%, with Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken at 17.4%.
Among top banks, France's Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) and BPCE and the Netherlands' ING showed the largest capital buffers over requirements, giving them room for larger payouts via dividends and buybacks, according to consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal.
Credit Agricole had 565 basis points of excess capital, followed by BPCE at 475 basis points and ING at 440 basis points, said Fernando de la Mora, a managing director at Alvarez & Marsal. 
Investment banks  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), in the midst of turnarounds, both performed below average under the adverse scenario, with scores of 7.56% and 7.73%, respectively. BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) came in at 8.28%, with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) at 8.52%.
""This outcome is all the more encouraging because the strong profit growth we delivered in the first half of 2021 is not reflected in this exercise,"" said Deutsche's chief financial officer, James von Moltke.
Just one of four Spanish banks tested, Bankinter, was above 10%.
The results of the tests, which were delayed from last year due to COVID-19, are seen as critical to banks resuming dividend payouts, which were barred during the pandemic in order to conserve capital.
""Since the start of COVID, there has been a problem of visibility of banks' relative asset quality. This stress test will increase transparency across the industry,"" said Javier Garcia, a partner at consultants Oliver Wyman.
ECB TEST
The European Central Bank said the stress test results showed that the euro area banking system is resilient when faced with a challenging macroeconomic scenario.
The ECB's separate test of 51 medium-sized lenders not part of the EBA exercise showed an average fall in capital from 18.1% at the start of the test to 11.3% at the end.
Three of Greece's top banks were among those whose capital levels fell below 8% by the end of the ECB test, as well as Portugal's Novo Banco, Bank of Cyprus, Italy's Carige and Banque Internationale Luxembourg.
After an ECB ban on dividends last year, which is set to be lifted, some banks this week have already begun guiding shareholders on dividends, and Garcia said this could not have been done without the lenders having emerged unscathed from the stress test.
More domestic focused banks suffered bigger hits to capital in the test compared with their cross-border peers.
The overall result is seen by EU regulators as being in line with stress tests by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.
Marco Troiano, an analyst at Scope credit rating agency, said the depletion of capital at each bank under the test's harshest scenario will be closely scrutinised, and could potentially lead to hostile takeovers.
Last month, U.S. banks cleared a Federal Reserve stress test and will no longer face pandemic-era restrictions on payouts. Britain's banks this week have also flagged dividends after their stress test results were announced earlier this month.
Although there was no pass or fail mark in the EU test, the results will be used by the bank's supervisor, which is the European Central Bank in the euro zone, to determine capital requirements.
Stress tests, now held every two years in the EU, were introduced annually in the aftermath of the global financial crisis over a decade ago, which forced taxpayers to bail out undercapitalised banks.
At the outset, pass or fail results were used to plug capital gaps, but as lenders became sufficiently capitalised, supervisors ditched the thresholds and have used the exercise to spot vulnerabilities and shape supervision.

Friday's test was the first that did not include UK lenders due to Britain leaving the EU last December.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 03:45PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC says Chinese IPO hopefuls must provide additional risk disclosures,"By Echo Wang, Scott Murdoch and Kane Wu
(Reuters) -The U.S. securities regulator will not allow Chinese companies to raise money in the United States unless they fully explain their legal structures and disclose the risk of Beijing interfering in their businesses, the agency said on Friday, confirming an exclusive report by Reuters.
In a statement, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said he had also asked staff to ""engage in targeted additional reviews of filings for companies with significant China-based operations.""
The development underscores U.S. policymakers' concerns that Chinese companies are systematically flouting U.S. rules that require public companies to disclose to investors a range of potential risks to their financial performance.
Chinese listings in the United States have reached a record $12.8 billion so far this year, according to Refinitiv data, as companies swooped in to capitalize on the U.S. stock market reaching daily record highs. 
Deal flows slowed substantially this month after Chinese regulators banned ride-sharing giant Didi Global Inc from signing up new users just days after its blockbuster IPO. They followed up with crack-downs on technology and private education companies. 
In an interview with Reuters earlier this week, SEC Commissioner Allison Lee said that Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges must disclose to investors the risks of the Chinese government interfering in their businesses as part of their regular reporting obligations.
On Friday, Reuters reported that the agency was not processing registrations for the issuance of Chinese company securities pending SEC guidance on how to disclose the risks they face in China.
Following that report, Gensler issued Friday's statement saying that in light of Beijing's crackdown, he had asked staff to seek additional disclosures from Chinese companies before making their registrations effective. 
These should include that investors face ""uncertainty about future actions by the government of China that could significantly affect the operating company’s financial performance"" and the enforceability of certain contractual arrangements.
Chinese issuers must also disclose if they were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges and the risks that such approval could be denied or rescinded. 
In addition, Chinese companies should disclose when Chinese law requires them to list in the United States via an offshore shell company, which carries additional legal risks. 
""I believe these changes will enhance the overall quality of disclosure in registration statements of offshore issuers that have affiliations with China-based operating companies,"" said Gensler. 
For a FACTBOX see: 
LATEST SALVO
The SEC's move represents the latest salvo by U.S. regulators against corporate China, which has frustrated Wall Street for years with its reluctance to submit to U.S. auditing standards and improve the governance of companies held closely by founders.
The agency has been under intense pressure from U.S. lawmakers to take a tougher line. A group of senators including Republicans John Kennedy and Bill Hagerty wrote to Gensler this week urging ""thorough investigations of U.S. listed Chinese companies' concerning lack of transparency.""
Last month, the SEC removed the chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which has been unsuccessful in a push to ensure independent auditing of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. The SEC is also under pressure to finalize rules on the delisting of Chinese companies that do not comply with U.S. auditing requirements. 
A total of 418 Chinese companies are listed on U.S. exchanges, according to Refinitiv. The S&P/BNY Mellon China Select ADR Index, which tracks the American depositary receipts of major U.S.-listed Chinese companies, has lost 22% of its value year-to-date, compared with an 18% rise in the S&P 500 index. 
No major U.S. IPO of a Chinese company is in the works following Didi, as the business community in China tries to come to grips with the regulators' intentions. 
Chinese officials said last week they would bar tutoring for profit in core school subjects to ease financial pressures on families that have contributed to low birth rates, sending shockwaves through the country's private education sector. This came on the heels of a broad crackdown on China's massive internet sector amid concern in Beijing over the safety of the personal data of its citizens.
China's securities regulator met with executives of global investment banks on Wednesday to calm financial market nerves, reassuring them that policies will be rolled out more steadily to avoid volatility, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

State-backed newspaper China Daily also said Beijing remained supportive of domestic companies seeking to list overseas.
Some Chinese companies canceled their U.S. IPOs this month proactively. LinkDoc Technologies pulled its offering to raise $211 million soon after Didi's troubles emerged, while Hello Inc this week announced its U.S. listing plans were on hold.,

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 03:40PM ET</span>",Amazon faces more than slowing sales growth: it needs more warehouses,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Danielle Kaye
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) needs to spend billions of dollars to expand its warehouse and delivery system, adding pressure to its shares which dropped 7% on Friday after it forecast lower sales growth.
The company is racing to meet demand even though shoppers are venturing more outside the home and it is returning to a pre-lockdown sales trajectory.
Last year, Amazon turned goods away from warehouses for weeks because it lacked the people and space to fulfill them safely. It still is playing catch-up, said Andrea Leigh, vice president at e-commerce optimization firm Ideoclick, who formerly worked at Amazon.
""Amazon is running out of available space,"" she said. ""They're also running out of labor.""
Even after the company almost doubled its warehouse and transportation network in the prior 18 months, it sees significant investment ahead, not to mention costs from hiring and training staff. A tight labor market forced Amazon to raise wages early and add signing bonuses to attract full and part-time employees, who now number 1,335,000.
It also has to get back on track to its goal of one-day Prime deliveries in the United States. ""This is all part of a multi-year investment cycle for us,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts Thursday.
For shareholders, Amazon's spending to capture long-term gains at the risk of near-term profit is in a playbook it has deployed over 27 years, sometimes testing the patience of Wall Street.
""Slower growth & increased investments make the shares more challenging,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said in a note.
Amazon plans to add 517 facilities to its global distribution infrastructure in the coming years, according to logistics consultancy MWPVL International. That is 176 million square feet on top of the 402 million it already has.
Amazon did not comment on the accuracy of those estimates, but said its infrastructure rollout already is ramping up. Over the past 12 months, capital expenditures and equipment leases jumped 74% to $54.5 billion, almost double the growth rate a year ago.

That may be par for the course for a $1.7 trillion retailer that wants to get bigger.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said Amazon's ramp-up in capital expenditures is more important than its revenue guidance.
""The consumer responds positively to higher/faster service levels,"" they said in a note. ""Unit volume accelerated following one day Prime delivery launch in 2Q19 – we believe it is only a matter of time before we see a similar impact as Amazon deploys fulfillment assets into the Holidays.""

The move comes as U.S. health officials said earlier this week Americans fully vaccinated against COVID-19 should go back to wearing masks in indoor public places in regions where the coronavirus is spreading rapidly.
All market, regional and divisional employees who work in multiple facilities and all campus office workers have to be vaccinated by Oct 4, the retailer said in a memo. 
The world's largest retailer had said in May fully vaccinated employees could work without masks.
Grocer Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co also said on Friday it would ""strongly encourage"" all customers and employees, including those who are vaccinated, to wear a mask when in its stores and facilities to stop the spread of the Delta variant.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) retail workers will post signage at its stores to encourage customers to wear masks, according to a separate company memo. Retail workers would also receive an incentive of $150, double the amount it had been paying, to get inoculated, with those already paid $75 set to receive the rest next month.

Store managers should regularly check the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website for potential changes to mask guidance in different locations, the company said.
Bloomberg News reported earlier this week Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s plans to restore its mask requirement policy at most of its U.S. retail stores, even for vaccinated customers and staff.

The global foodservice market is expected to reach $3978.83 billion by 2026, registering a 4.7% CAGR.

Therefore, we think financially sound Mexican restaurant companies,  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc . (NYSE:CMG),  Yum! Brands Inc . (NYSE:YUM),  Fiesta Restaurant Group Inc . (FRGI), and Del Taco Restaurant Inc. (TACO), with their iconic brands, are well-positioned to optimize their revenues.

Furthermore, the Federal Reserve's reaffirmation that interest rates will remain unchanged in the near term has created a positive outlook for small-cap tech companies such as Impinj (PI) and ZIX Corporation (ZIXI). So, Wall Street analysts are bullish about these two stocks and expect them to rally by more than 50% in the coming months. Let’s discuss.As people and businesses grow more reliant on technology, tech companies are widening their bases and expanding their offerings to capitalize on the growing demand. Furthermore, with widespread digitalization across nearly every industry, and the increasing deployment of the 5G networks, investors are becoming evermore bullish about the industry. This is evidenced by the iShares U.S. Technology ETF’s (IYW) 20.5% return over the past six months.
Because the Fed has declared that it will keep benchmark interest rates near zero for now, with no plans to raise them in the soon, small-cap companies have much scope to grow by taking advantage of the ‘cheap money’ environment. In fact, with mega-cap tech shares experiencing a sell-off on investors’ expectations of a market correction due to the COVID-19 resurgence, small-cap tech stocks could be safer bets now.
As such, Wall Street Analysts expect fundamentally sound small-cap technology stocks Impinj Inc. (PI) and Zix Corporation (NASDAQ:ZIXI) to rally by more than 50% over the next 12 months.

(Reuters) - A contractor sued  LyondellBasell Industries  (NYSE:LYB) in May, alleging lax safety measures led to a workplace accident at the same plant that leaked chemicals this week, killing two contractors and injuring 30 workers. 
Tuesday's accident was one of the worst U.S. chemical plant disasters since a 2019 Texas blast forced the evacuation of some 60,000 people the day before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. 
The suit, filed in a Texas District Court in Houston against LyondellBasell Acetyls, said the company failed to provide a safe work environment at its facility in La Porte, leading to a pair of accidents last year.
In December 2020, plaintiff Adam Good was injured while working in a below-ground excavation trench box after a valve broke and forcefully pushed water and other liquids into the area. Good's lanyard became entangled, preventing him from exiting, the lawsuit said. As a result he nearly drowned and was injured.
The suit alleges Lyondell had knowledge that the method used to secure the valve was ineffective but did not intervene. It also said a similar incident had recently occurred at that unit. 
On Tuesday, Lyondell's acetyls unit in La Porte leaked some 100,000 pounds of a mixture including acetic acid, leading to the two worker deaths and multiple injuries. The leak did not prompt an evacuation of the surrounding area. 
Good and his lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A separate lawsuit against Lyondell was filed on Thursday by Bryant Hinojosa, a worker injured earlier this week. That suit, which seeks monetary damages exceeding $1 million, alleges that negligence on the part of Lyondell led to the accident.
The suit claims Lyondell discovered the leak on Tuesday and called out a company that specializes in sealing and correcting industrial leaks. Lyondell was told the leak needed to be sealed and repaired, but opted to call other contractors up to temporarily fix the leak, putting off permanent repairs until later, the suit said. 
Hinojosa and his lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
LyondellBasell said it is aware of the lawsuits but does not comment on pending litigation.

(Reuters) - An Illinois jury on Friday refused to hold Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) liable for a woman's death from ovarian cancer, which her family blamed on decades of using its talc-based powders.
Relatives of the late Elizabeth Driscoll had sought up to $50 million in damages, saying J&J knew its baby powder and Shower to Shower products were dangerous.
Driscoll died in September 2016 at age 69, eighteen months after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The lawsuit was brought by her niece Colleen Cadagin, who oversees her estate. 
Jurors in St. Clair County, Illinois ruled for J&J after a three-week trial.
In a statement, J&J said the verdict reflected the jury's ""careful consideration of the science and facts presented,"" while adding that ""we deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from cancer and know they are seeking answers.""
Leigh O'Dell, who represented Driscoll's family, said the evidence linking genital talc to ovarian cancers remains overwhelming.
""This decision will not dissuade us from seeking justice for the thousands of women who have become victims of this disease through the corporate negligence and greed of Johnson & Johnson,"" she said.
The verdict came after the trial judge on Monday held the company in contempt because a defense witness failed to show up for cross examination, the family's lawyers have said.
J&J, based in New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey, said this week it faces about 34,600 lawsuits over talc-based powders, up from 20,600 a year earlier.
In June the U.S. Supreme Court rejected its bid to overturn a $2.12 billion damages award in Missouri to 22 women who blamed their ovarian cancer on its talc products.

J&J in 2020 set aside $3.9 billion for legal expenses, primarily for talc-related liabilities.
The company is exploring whether to move talc liabilities into a new company that would then seek bankruptcy protection, seven people familiar with the matter have said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate voted by a wide margin on Friday to take up a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, as Republicans and Democrats alike advanced President Joe Biden's top priority of renovating roads and bridges. 
The 66-28 vote was hailed by lawmakers of both parties as a sign that Washington was capable of working through sharp partisan differences on a package that would boost the economy and restore vital but aging transportation links that Americans depend upon.
The vote was suspended for more than 45 minutes as lawmakers questioned how it would affect broadband internet access, in a sign of the complexity of both the bill and the politics surrounding it. Several lawmakers said it was difficult to determine details of the bill because aides were still drafting legislative text.
Senators were scheduled to work through the weekend on the sweeping plan, which would dramatically increase the nation's spending on roads, bridges, transit and airports. Supporters predicted it would ultimately pass the Senate and House, eventually reaching Biden's desk for him to sign it into law.
""Basically we're on the right track,"" said Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who was part of a bipartisan group that crafted the bill with the White House over months of negotiations.
The package includes about $550 billion in new spending, on top of $450 billion that was previously approved. It also includes money for eliminating lead water pipes and building electric vehicle charging stations.
The bill does not include funding for most climate change and social initiatives that Democrats aim to pass in a separate $3.5 trillion measure without Republican support.
Both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, have been upbeat about prospects for the bill.
McConnell was one of 16 Republicans who voted with all 50 Democrats to advance the bill.
Democrats hold razor-thin margins in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning the party must stick together to achieve its legislative goals. Progressive (NYSE:PGR) members of the House Democratic caucus have already suggested the $1 trillion package is inadequate.

Biden on Thursday said the separate $3.5 trillion bill should include a pathway to citizenship for the ""Dreamer"" immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. It was unclear whether that would be possible under the Senate's complex rules.
Schumer said he plans to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Democratic climate and social spending bill before senators take their summer break, which was supposed to start in the second week of August.

1136,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 01:09PM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank, SocGen Among Weakest in European Stress Test","(Bloomberg) --  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA emerged among the weakest of the large European lenders in a stress test that regulators will consult when vetting plans on investor payouts.
The German lender’s common equity tier 1 ratio, one of the most important measures of financial strength, fell 620 basis points to 7.4% in an adverse scenario that assumes a prolonged period of low interest rates and a steep contraction of the economy over three years. Societe Generale’s ratio dropped 562 basis points to 7.5% in the European Banking Authority’s assessment, published late Friday.
“Deutsche Bank shows its resilience in a potential economic crisis even in a harsher and unfavorable scenario,” Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said in statement. He pointed out that the bank’s rising profits in the first half of 2021 weren’t factored into the test.
The EBA’s exam, which looked at 50 banks in the region, doesn’t have a pass or fail grade, but it guides the European Central Bank and other regulators in assessing the financial system’s capital needs, as well as the appropriateness of dividend levels and staff bonuses at the banks they supervise. The ECB announced earlier this month that economic conditions have brightened enough for it to lift the restrictions on dividends in September.
The EBA’s adverse scenario showed banks on aggregate are better prepared after the pandemic to deal with a severe economic crisis than they were three years ago. They built up a CET1 ratio of 15% at the end of last year, the highest since the tests began. The measure dropped to 10.2% in the adverse scenario, slightly better than in the last round of simulations three years ago.
“Banks have continued building up their capital base,” the EBA wrote in a release late Friday. “This was achieved despite an unprecedented decline of the EU’s GDP and the first effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.”
But the EBA also pointed to dispersion in individual banks’ performance, with lenders focused on domestic activities or with lower interest income worst hit.
For Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) and SocGen, the results represented a steeper drop than in some past tests. Deutsche Bank’s CET1 ratio fell to 8.1% in the 2018 test and 7.8% in the 2016 exam. SocGen’s ratio fell to 7.6% and 7.5% in those past tests. Capital rules require banks to maintain a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, plus other buffers that can be adjusted by regulators as needed.
Italy’s Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA saw its CET1 ratio slump to a negative 0.1% in the adverse scenario, the worst among the lenders sampled. The world’s oldest bank, still state-owned after a bailout, is now in talks about being acquired by UniCredit SpA, according to a statement late Thursday.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA, one of the lenders hit hard by the ECB’s dividend restrictions, saw its ratio drop to 8.2%, slightly better than SocGen and Deutsche Bank. Its among ten of the biggest euro-area banks that have more than 22 billion euros ($26 billion) set aside to reward shareholders, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Banco Bilbao (NYSE:BBVA) Vizcaya Argentaria SA,  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV, Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) SpA and Nordea Bank Abp (OTC:NRDBY) also have big reserves.
SocGen said in June it could potentially boost dividends when it has enough clarity on the regulatory framework and the outlook for the economy. The lender currently has a payout ratio of 50% of underlying net income including share buybacks.
Deutsche Bank has said it wants to resume paying dividends next year after Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing suspended them in 2019 to fund an extensive restructuring. Because it didn’t pay a dividend at the time, it wasn’t affected by the ECB’s de-facto ban last year.
The ECB imposed the ban partly as a trade-off for extensive regulatory relief granted to ensure credit kept flowing to businesses hurt by the crisis. Some bank executives have criticized the decision, saying it impaired their ability to raise capital because it’s made banks less attractive for investors.
The ECB has said it will “assess the capital and distribution plans of each bank” individually, indicating that the removal of the cap doesn’t mean it will allow banks to set payout levels at will. The 2021 stress test results will factor into those talks, it said.
When the ECB lifted the dividend cap, it also renewed its call on banks to tread carefully on bonus payments as part of its effort to keep banks from making large discretionary payouts to staff or investors that would deplete their capital cushions. The supervisor earlier this rejected the compensation plans of several banks including BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and UniCredit, forcing them to cut their bonus pools, Bloomberg News has reported.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 01:06PM ET</span>","Chevron tops profit estimates, joins share buyback stampede","By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) -Chevron Corp on Friday reported its highest profit in six quarters and joined an oil industry stampede to reward investors with share buybacks, as rebounding crude oil prices carried earnings and cash flow to pre-pandemic levels. Oil and gas are trading near multi-year highs as fuel consumption has thrown off pandemic losses and natural gas has soared on weather demand. OPEC's decision to carry production curbs into next year has kept oil above $70 per barrel.
The company cut its annual capital spending forecast to about $13 billion, now below what it had spent last year. It had earlier budgeted $14 billion to $16 billion a year in annual capital spending through 2025.
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) last year cut expenses to allow profits to flow at above $50 a barrel. Lower costs and higher prices generated the highest cash flow in two years, enabling it to pare debt and resume share repurchases, officials said. Share buybacks will resume this quarter at an annual rate of between $2 billion and $3 billion, said Chief Executive Michael Wirth, about half the annual rate it had planned.
The company and its rivals halted purchases early last year as the pandemic cut oil demand. Chevron now joins Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), TotalEnergies and Equinor in resuming buybacks.
""We've always said we would begin buybacks when we were confident that we could sustain it, and our breakeven is $50 per barrel and we are now well above it,"" Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber told Reuters.
""We're trying to win back investors... demand for our products has fully recovered, demand for our stock is recovering.""
The second-largest U.S. producer's oil and gas production unit earned $3.18 billion in the quarter compared with a loss of $6.09 billion a year ago.
Total production rose 5% to 3.13 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), while Chevron sold its U.S. oil for $54 a barrel last quarter, compared with $19 a year earlier. 
Chevron expects output from the Permian basin to be almost same as last year's, but said it will add drilling rigs in the second half. Its production rate from the top U.S. shale basin is expected to be 600,000 boepd by 2021 end.
""It's still a fundamentally oversupplied world and that's why we're being cautious... We're not going to be driven by an output target or a production target,"" Jay Johnson, Chevron's upstream executive vice president told analysts.
Meanwhile, top U.S. oil producer  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) said it expects more spending on key projects, including Guyana and Permian, in the second half of this year.
Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors, said Chevron's Permian additions ""still seem measured"" and the two U.S. producers seemed to be focusing on cashflow over production.
Crude oil prices this year through June were up 57%, while hard-hit refining and chemicals improved with better plant utilization rates and margins.
The United States accounted for most of a $839 million profit at Chevron's refining operations in the quarter as Asia units suffered from weak margins.

CFO Breber said cost-cuts are largely over and it has achieved targeted savings from its 2020 takeover of  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL). It is aiming to raise up to $2 billion from asset sales this year. Its adjusted profit of $1.71 per share beat Wall Street estimates of $1.59, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The company's shares were down 0.9% at $101.65 in afternoon trade after opening higher amid a broader drop in energy stocks.

The extra costs, which would range between $350 million and $400 million, could be incurred in the third quarter, Aon Chief Financial Officer Christa Davies said on a post-earnings call with analysts.
Earlier this week, the companies said they had mutually decided to pull the plug on their $30 billion merger that would have created the world's largest insurance broker, due to regulatory objections.
The termination of the deal was hailed as a victory for the Biden administration. Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice sued to block the merger. 
""Despite regulatory momentum around the world ... we reached an impasse with the U.S. Department of Justice,"" Aon Chief Executive Officer Greg Case had said.

The U.S. regulators' stand was in contrast to that of their European counterparts who had approved the deal on condition the companies sell certain assets.
London-based Aon on Friday reported a 5% drop in second-quarter net income attributable to shareholders.

(Reuters) -Procter & Gamble Co expects higher core earnings this year despite warning of a nearly $2 billion hit from rising commodity and transportation expenses, relying on price increases and cost cuts to cushion the hit to its margins.
Shares of the company, which also named a new CEO on Thursday, rose 2.7% to $143.28 after it reported fourth-quarter results that beat estimates.
Higher freight and commodity costs for everything from palm oil to plastics due to pandemic-led disruptions have forced many consumer goods firms to raise prices, including P&G, which hiked prices in emerging markets and on products such as Pampers diapers in the U.S. earlier this year.
P&G still faced significant input costs across most of its commodity basket, with pulp, resin and polypropylene being some of the top drivers, CFO Andre Schulten said on Friday.
The company also expects a $100 million higher transportation bill this year, mainly in the United States, where a driver shortage is causing disruptions, Schulten added.
Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Reckitt Benckiser Group are some of the other major consumer goods companies to warn of soaring costs squeezing profits this year.
Consumer spending in the United States rose more than expected in June, partly due to higher prices, with annual inflation accelerating further above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
P&G expects a roughly $1.9 billion after-tax hit from input costs this year, which it plans to offset through an increase in sales, cost cuts across the company and further price hikes.
On Thursday, the company said David Taylor would be stepping down as chief executive officer in November, handing over the reins to company veteran Jon Moeller.
Moeller, the company's current chief operating officer, said on Friday that he currently does not expect any major strategy changes after taking over.

Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) forecast fiscal 2022 core earnings per share to rise 3% to 6%, to between $5.82 and $6.00, the mid-point of which was above the $5.90 that analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The company expects full-year net sales to rise 2% to 4%.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 12:41PM ET</span>","Earnings bounce, bond-yield drop help keep party going for U.S. stocks","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rebound in corporate profits and the recent drop in bond yields are helping to moderate U.S. equity valuations, bolstering the case for owning stocks even as markets stand near records and economic growth is expected to slow. 
The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed more than 17% so far this year, galloping higher despite concerns over a surge in inflation and a projected fall-off in economic growth. 
At the same time, however, stock valuations have edged lower since the start of the year. The S&P 500’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a commonly used measure of the market's valuation, stands at 21.4 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv Datastream. That is still well above its 15.4 historical average, but below the 22.7 level from January. 
Meanwhile, a rally in Treasury markets that has seen the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fall 50 basis points since late March as bond prices shot higher has also helped raise the allure of stocks as an investment. 
“I think the stock market is still the place to be,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. “Even though valuations are lofty, the fundamentals are good, most companies are having excellent quarters and the outlook is pretty good.” 
The focus on valuations comes as investors assess various cross-currents that can sway markets over the next few months, including an expected slowdown in growth, a resurgence of U.S. COVID-19 cases and the Federal Reserve’s plans for unwinding the easy money policies that have helped support asset prices since the pandemic-fueled sell-off in March 2020.
Investors will get a fresh snapshot of the economy next week with the monthly U.S. jobs report and another batch of earnings reports from companies such as Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
Expectations of strong future earnings have been the key driver of the S&P 500’s gains this year, according to a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysis of the index’s year-to-date performance that compared change in stock valuations with changes in expected earnings. 
Continued better-than-expected earnings are poised to keep valuations in check. Earnings are now expected to have climbed 87.2% in the second quarter versus forecasts of 65.4% at the start of July, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
“If you have an environment like the one we are in where the companies are beating expectations by 18-20%, that means that the P/E is lower than the official number,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse projects the S&P 500 will end the year at 4,600, about 4% above Thursday's close of 4,419.15.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) have been among the season’s big earnings beats. Investors were less happy with Thursday’s report from e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), whose shares took a hit after it said sales growth would slow in the next few quarters. 
The fall in bond yields, with the 10-year yield dropping recently to about 1.25%, has also boosted the relative attractiveness of stocks. 
The equity risk premium - a comparison of the earnings yield on stocks to the interest rate on bonds - currently is at a level that has historically corresponded to an average 12-month gain for the S&P 500 of 15.2%, according to the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent note that its S&P 500 year-end target of 4,300 is predicated on a 10-year yield at 1.9%. A yield of 1.6%, still more than 30 basis points above where yields stand currently, would lift Goldman's fair value estimate for the S&P to 4,700 by year end, keeping the modeled growth and other factors constant, the bank said.
Still, some investors have grown nervous over stock valuations, which are elevated by many historical measures despite recent earnings blowouts.
One valuation metric flashing warning signs is the cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio, which takes a longer-term view to adjust for gyrations in business cycles. It has climbed to its highest level in more than 20 years.

The rise in the CAPE ratio was one factor that Cresset Capital Management considered before modestly scaling back its overall equity exposure earlier this year for its portfolios that have at least a 7-year investment horizon, said Cresset chief investment officer Jack Ablin.
“Stock valuations are expensive, extremely expensive,"" he said. ""From that lens, the market does not have a very compelling long-term future.”

In May, Horta-Osorio had bought 1.1 million Swiss francs worth of shares in the group.
The former Lloyds (LON:LLOY) chief executive is looking at the bank's risk management and culture in the wake of two major crises as well as reviewing the bank's strategic options. 

His purchase comes a day after a review found a ""lackadaisical"" attitude towards risk and ""a lack of accountability"" were to blame for its $5.5 billion loss on investment fund Archegos as the bank reported a near 80% fall in second-quarter profit.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 12:28PM ET</span>","Farm produce giant Dole falls in market debut, valued at $1.4 billion","By Sohini Podder
(Reuters) - Dole Plc shares fell more than 6% in their New York Stock Exchange debut on Friday, giving the fruit and vegetable grower a valuation of nearly $1.4 billion. 
The company's stock opened at $15, below the initial public offering (IPO) price of $16, even after Dole slashed its marketed price range earlier this week.
The company sold 25 million shares in the IPO, lower than its target of 30.3 million shares, to raise about $400 million. Of the shares sold, a little over 2.46 million shares were offered by the company's existing investors.
Dole was formed through the merger of Ireland's Total Produce PLC and Dole Food Company Inc, in a deal that led to the departure of its 98-year-old billionaire owner David Murdock.
Originally a real estate investor, the American billionaire took over Dole in the 1980s by purchasing its parent company Castle & Cooke. He took Dole private in 2003, only to float it publicly in 2009 and then buy it out again four years later.
The IPO is one of the final pieces of the merger between Total Produce and Dole Food.
The COVID-19 pandemic had hit certain parts of the company's business, particularly its food-service segment on the Total side, Chief Executive Officer Rory Byrne said in an interview.
But sales of its fresh produce through retailers more than offset the weakness in the food-service unit, Byrne added. 
Dole posted pro forma revenue of $9 billion for fiscal 2020, of which nearly half came from the North American business while Europe accounted for about 45%, a regulatory filing showed.

It had about 40,000 employees as of Dec 31, 2020.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities and Davy were the lead underwriters for the offering.

Investing.com – Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) stock soared 30% Friday as the company’s fourth-quarter results left brokerages impressed, with at least seven of them raising their price targets.
In the words of Co-founder and Co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes, the company had “a ripper of a quarter”.  It added over 23,000 new customers, to pass the 200,000-mark.
“We have a lot of confidence in Atlassian, but the truth is we expected the cloud transition to be a bit choppier than it’s been to date. Perhaps the upside surprise has been a master class in expectations management, but more likely it’s that the firm has built cloud products that customers want and that they see value in making the cutover,” Canaccord Genuity analyst David Hynes wrote, according to StreetInsider.
Total revenue rose 30% to $559.5 million for the fourth quarter and topped $2 billion for the year for the first time.
The seven new price targets for the stock range between Truist Securities’ $270 and  Mizuho  Securities' (NYSE:MFG) $370. At 1152am ET, the stock traded at $331.50, still around 11% away from the Japanese brokerage’s target.

(Reuters) -European stocks fell from record highs on Friday as concerns about the fast-spreading Delta variant and regulatory actions in China outweighed optimism around the quarterly earnings season and an economic recovery. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.5%, but rose for a sixth straight month in July, its longest winning streak since 2012-13 when it rose for 12 months in a row. 
""We've seen moves in both directions this week, but they've lacked any sort of conviction,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. 
""The overriding concern being whether the second half of the year will be able to match up to some of the decent numbers we've seen from various company updates this week.""
Travel and leisure stocks and miners were the top decliners. 
Italy's UniCredit gained 2.8% after posting higher-than-expected net profit, and said late on Thursday it had embarked on formal talks with the government over the possible acquisition of rival Monte dei Paschi di Siena. Monte dei Paschi added 3.4%.
EssilorLuxottica rose 3.4% as the Ray-Ban maker raised its full-year guidance after revenue doubled in the second quarter.
Overall, out of half the STOXX 600 companies that have reported so far, 67% have topped analysts' profit estimates, according to Refinitiv IBES data. While that is below the 72% beat-rate in the first quarter, it still tops the 51% rate in a typical quarter.
""We have had exceptional expectations, yet the companies have managed to beat those expectations,"" said Oliver Collin, fund manager of European equities at Invesco. ""Interesting thing in Europe is those beats, quite different to the U.S., were rewarded in some sort of positive share price momentum."" 
Collin believes European equities' slant toward cheaply valued cyclical sectors and a stronger recovery momentum in the second quarter played a part in prompting the recent positive market response.
The euro zone economy grew more strongly than expected in the second quarter as the bloc rebounded from a recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, preliminary data showed.

Emergent came under regulatory scrutiny after an error led to millions of vaccine doses being ruined at its manufacturing facility in Baltimore, which was producing bulk drug substance for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April halted operations at the plant after it discovered that ingredients from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine, also being produced there at that time, contaminated a batch of J&J's vaccines.
Emergent in a filing https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/node/20661/html on Friday said it has received ""preliminary inquiries and subpoenas to produce documents"" from the lawmakers, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and Maryland and New York Attorneys General.
The Department of Justice declined to comment on the matter.
Emergent said it was producing and has produced documents as required in response and will continue to cooperate with the government inquiries.
An FDA inspection in April turned up a long list of sanitary problems and bad manufacturing practices at the facility, including failure to train personnel to avoid cross contamination of COVID-19 vaccines from J&J and AstraZeneca.

Emergent said on Wednesday production at the Baltimore facility will now resume, following remedial actions, additional reviews and collaboration with the FDA and its manufacturing partners.
An FDA spokesperson said on Thursday the facility has not yet received any authorization for a COVID-19 vaccine, but may produce vaccine substance in advance of future inspections by the health regulator.

(Reuters) - Two Native American tribes have formally asked a U.S. federal court to prevent Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp from excavating its Thacker Pass lithium mine site in Nevada, which they say contains their ancestors' bones and should not be disturbed.
The Reno-Sparks Indian Colony and Atsa koodakuh wyh Nuwu/People of Red Mountain filed their preliminary injunction request late Thursday, a filing that had been expected. The tribes say federal regulators did not adequately consult with them before approving the project in January.
The project would become one of the largest U.S. producers of the electric vehicle battery metal. First, though, Lithium Americas needs to conduct archaeological digging at the site in order to catalog historical artifacts. It has not yet obtained necessary permits from federal officials to do so. 
The tribes' injunction request essentially asks the court to prevent that archaeological digging even if the company obtains those permits. 
""The excavators and shovels could harm the very human remains the archaeologists would be looking for,"" the tribes said in the filing.
Chief Judge Miranda Du of the U.S. District Court for Nevada asked for responses from Lithium Americas and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management - which manages the federal land atop the lithium deposit - by August 12. 
Vancouver-based Lithium Americas and the BLM declined to comment on the filing. 

Du denied a similar injunction request last week from environmentalists who argued the project could harm wildlife. Earlier this week, though, the judge allowed the tribes to join the lawsuit to argue their concerns the project could harm historical sites.
Beyond the injunction requests, Du is considering whether former President Donald Trump's administration erred when it approved the entire project in January. That ruling is expected by early 2022.

The spin-off is a necessary step for the Treasury to meet terms agreed with UniCredit as Italy's no.2 bank and the Rome government negotiate a potential purchase of MPS by Unicredit (MI:CRDI) 
UniCredit said late on Thursday it had signed a termsheet with the Treasury detailing the conditions on which it could buy ""selected parts"" of the Tuscan lender. The conditions include protection from any actual and potential non-ordinary risks stemming from MPS's pending lawsuits.
Such risks would be spun off from the bank and be kept in the Treasury's hands, said the source, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The spin-off scheme needs clearance from European Union competition authorities, which want any potential solution to comply with EU state aid laws.

UniCredit also said it would not take on any of MPS's impaired loans and would be allowed to offload MPS's performing loans that appear risky. Reuters reported on Thursday that state-owned bad loan manager AMCO would take on MPS's problem loans.
The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italian-American vehicle maker CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI) on Friday raised its revenue and free cash flow forecasts for this year, confident an industry cyclical upturn would help it offset a severe impact from supply chain constraints.
""It's the worst supply chain situation I've seen in my career,"" Chief Executive Scott Wine told analysts. ""I recently equated our tireless efforts to manage this crazy supply chain situation to a game of whack-a-mole.""
The maker of farm machinery, Iveco commercial vehicles, construction equipment and powertrains said it now estimated an impact from raw material cost increases, freight costs and other supply chain bottlenecks worth around $1 billion in 2021.
The CEO however said a ""robust environment"" contributed to expand CNH's order books and to an ""excellent"" performance across all its main businesses in the second quarter of this year and that it was poised for a ""noteworthy second half"". 
The group now sees its sales from industrial activities to grow by 24%-28% this year versus a previous forecast of between 14%-18%. Free cash flow is seen in excess of $1 billion, from a previous forecast of $0.6 billion-$1.0 billion.
The outlook improvement came as CNH said its adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) of industrial activities stood at $699 million in the second quarter, versus a $58 million loss a year earlier. That compares with a $496 million forecast in an analyst poll compiled by Reuters.
Sales at the group's industrial activities rose 65% in the April-June period to $8.49 billion, topping a $7.06 billion analyst forecast.
Milan-listed shares in CNH turned positive to rise as much as 1.7% after results were published. By 1515 GMT they were up 0.1%.
CNH, controlled by Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, last month announced a $2.1 billion deal to buy U.S.-based Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) Industries to bolster its agricultural equipment business, as it prepares to spin off its truck, bus and engine operations.

Asked whether he saw interference from potential rival bidders, Wine said he believed CNH was the ""right owner"" for Raven.
""We think that we're going to bring this home and quite confident,"" he said, adding he saw no impediments to complete the deal - expected to be finalised in the fourth quarter - ""in a timely fashion"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wealthy families that set up investment funds known as ""family offices"" to manage their personal wealth would face stricter oversight from U.S. regulators under a bill advanced by a U.S. congressional panel late on Thursday.
The bill was among 11 that lawmakers hope will address failings highlighted by March's meltdown of family office Archegos Capital which led to billions of dollars in losses for some banks and January's GameStop (NYSE:GME) saga.
Whether they pass or not, the bills considered by the House Financial Services Committee would increase the pressure on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to take swift action, analysts said. 
The legislation targets family offices with more than $750 million in assets, retail trading practices and short selling.
The bills also target January's GameStop meme stock saga during which retail investors trading on low-cost brokers like  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) banded together to burn hedge funds that had bet against the retailer. 
One bill directs the SEC to study restricting ""payment for order flow"" whereby brokers route orders to wholesale market makers in return for a fee. Critics say the practice creates conflicts of interest that can push up prices for retail investors.
Any changes to the model could hurt Robinhood, which had a miserable stock market debut on Thursday, partly due to investor worries over regulatory risks.
Another bill directs the SEC to require investors to disclose their positions monthly instead of quarterly, and to include certain derivatives and ""short"" bets that stocks will fall.

Several industry insiders said Wall Street will fight the changes. 
Thomas Handler, a partner at law firm Handler Thayer which has over 300 family offices as clients, said the proposal for family offices to register with the SEC would become an ""intrusion of privacy.""

(Reuters) -Exxon Mobil on Friday posted its biggest quarterly profit in more than a year that also sailed past analysts' estimates, boosted by higher oil prices and record earnings at its chemicals business.
The upbeat results following a contested board fight over the company's direction highlighted how oil producers are taking advantage of a recovery in oil prices to cut debt and boost shareholder payouts rather than spend more to raise production.
""Positive momentum continued during the second quarter across all of our businesses as the global economic recovery increased demand for our products,"" Chief Executive Darren Woods said.
Exxon said its 2021 capital spending is expected to be at the lower end of the prior range of $16 billion to $19 billion. 
Earlier in the day, rival  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) cut its 2021 budget, although both U.S. producers expect higher spending in the second half of the year as they resume investments on key projects, including the prolific Permian basin.
""ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) continued the parade of major oils companies with rapidly improving results, recovering from the depths of the COVID crisis during the second quarter last year,"" Third Bridge Group's Peter McNally said.
Exxon again used higher cash flow to pare a massive debt built up to preserve its shareholder dividend amid historic losses. The company cut debt by $2.7 billion, bringing total reductions to about $7 billion since the end of 2020.
While Exxon backed shareholder returns through dividend, Chevron said it would resume share buybacks at an annual rate of between $2 billion and $3 billion.
Exxon also said it was on pace to achieve cost savings of $6 billion through 2023 relative to 2019. In the first half of 2021, it cut over $1 billion in costs, on top of reductions of $3 billion last year.
Exxon earned $1.10 per share in the second quarter, beating market expectations of 99 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Late last month, the company had given a broad indication about its results, prompting several analysts to reduce their earning projections.
Shareholders had cast out three Exxon directors in May for a hedge fund's nominees, promising to boost returns and better prepare the company for a low-carbon world.
CEO Woods said the company started working with the new directors in June with in-depth reviews of its businesses and the first in-person regular meeting of the board took place this week following virtual sessions. 
Earnings from its chemicals and plastics business rose nearly fivefold from a year ago to a record $2.32 billion as margins expanded on strong demand for plastic packaging, tight industry supply and shipping constraints.
Higher oil prices pushed earnings in the company's exploration and production business to $3.19 billion. Output fell 2% to 3.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day during the quarter.
The company said it expects higher oil and gas volumes in the current quarter due to reduced planned maintenance.
However, refining and marketing business is yet to recover and posted a loss of $227 million, hurt mainly by maintenance costs and product oversupply. 
Exxon's U.S. refining business has lost money for six quarters in a row. Outside the United States, refining operations have run in the red in five of the last six quarter.

Shares of the company, which have risen 43% this year after plunging during the height of the pandemic, were down 2.3% at $57.59, amid a broader drop in energy stocks. 
Net income for the second quarter came in at $4.69 billion, compared with a loss of $1.08 billion a year ago, which included a gain related to reversing an inventory writedown.

Below, we provide a look at three residential construction stocks investors should avoid as the housing market begins to cool. Those stocks are as follows:  Toll Brothers  (NYSE:TOL), NVR (NYSE:NVR), and D.R. Horton (DHI).0.The housing market is cooling off as demand falls with rising prices. This is not surprising based on recent earnings report from homebuilders.
Sales of new homes in the United States declined in June, dropping down to the lowest level since the initial month of the ongoing pandemic. It is clear many of those interested in buying a home are now willing to wait out the market. It is quite possible the end to the nationwide eviction ban and the mandatory resumption of mortgage payments will move the pendulum back in favor of homebuyers.
The plain truth of the matter is home prices increased much too quickly, largely because so few homes were on the market this past year. If the pandemic ends at some point in the second half of 2021, homeowners will feel more comfortable selling, ultimately bringing the housing market back to equilibrium. Below, we provide a look at three residential construction stocks investors should avoid as the housing market begins to cool. Those stocks are as follows: Toll Brothers (TOL), NVR (NVR), and D.R.

So, read on for a closer evaluation of these funds.U.S.-listed Chinese stocks recently suffered their biggest two-day loss since 2008 due to investors’ pessimism around Beijing’s crackdown on its tech and education sectors. Amid heightened tensions between the world’s two largest economies, China’s cyberspace regulators on July 10 introduced sweeping draft rules for cybersecurity reviews of domestic internet companies that seek overseas listings.
However, these stocks’ price tumble has made many China ADRs solid bargains considering their long-term growth prospects that are based on a thriving domestic economy.

(Reuters) -Caterpillar Inc on Friday reported higher quarterly earnings but said profits will suffer in the current quarter because of rising costs, sparking a sell-off in its shares.
American manufacturers of all sizes are grappling with the strongest inflationary pressure in three decades as a result of supply bottlenecks and a relentless rise in raw-materials prices in the past 13 months.
The Illinois-based manufacturer of heavy machinery said it has carried out price increases twice this year to offset higher raw material costs. Still, higher materials and freight costs, marketing and R&D spending and employee compensation are expected to hurt the company's operating profit margin in the quarter through September.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT)'s shares were the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday, having outperformed the blue chip index so far this year. The industrial giant's shares were down 4% at $203.94 in morning trade.
""Moderating margin expectations is probably not enough to drive additional near-term excitement,"" analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) wrote in a note.
The company said materials and freight costs will be higher in the second half of the year. Short-term incentive compensation is estimated to shave off $1.5 billion from company profits this year.
It did not provide an earnings forecast for this year, citing a highly fluid environment. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield told Reuters the company does not expect to offer profit per share guidance this year.
In an interview, Bonfield said the company still faces supply chain challenges and is using innovative ways such as securing supplies from non-traditional sources to deal with shortages of resin and semiconductors.
""It is a challenge, and we are dealing with it,"" he said.
Caterpillar is prioritizing orders that dealers have received from customers over those placed to replenish stocks at showrooms, he said. As a result, the company does not expect a significant change in dealer inventory this year, Bonfield said.
The company, an industrial bellwether and proxy for global economic activity, has been benefiting from the strongest global growth since 1976 on the back of unprecedented public spending.
A run-up in commodity prices is also encouraging miners to invest in new machines.
Caterpillar expects equipment demand to remain strong in the current quarter. Sales of construction machines in China are also expected to recover after a modest decline in the latest quarter to end the year flat.

Adjusted profit for the second quarter came in at $2.60 per share, up from $1.27 per share a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, expected earnings of $2.40 per share.
Equipment sales increased 31% year-on-year in the quarter to $12.2 billion, with sales rising across all regions and businesses.

1162,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 11:26AM ET</span>",Global bonds in July notch up best month since 2020 COVID meltdown,"By Yoruk Bahceli
(Reuters) - Government bonds enjoyed their biggest monthly rally in July since at least March 2020, driven by risks from the COVID-19 Delta variant and central bank assurances that a paring back of monetary support was still far off.
Concerns that the economic recovery was not as strong as expected prompted an initial rally, amplified by those who had bet against bonds rushing back into the market, investors say. 
Central bankers remain supportive. U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said on July 14 the U.S. job market ""is still a ways off"" from the progress it wanted to see before reducing bond buying, comments that changed more hawkish perceptions that followed the Fed's June meeting.
The European Central Bank's July 22 meeting signalled its determination to achieve a new 2% inflation target, while China cut banks' reserve requirements this month in a sign economic momentum was faltering.
As bond prices rallied, German and Australian 10-year government bond yields were set for their biggest monthly falls since January 2020, down over 20 basis points each by 1426 GMT on Friday. British 10-year bonds dropped nearly 15 basis points.
U.S. 10 Treasury yields have seen their biggest drop since March 2020, the height of last year's market panic triggered by the spread of coronavirus. 
Graphic: Government bond yields plunge in July: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jnvwegbejvw/HYsyJ-government-bond-yields-plunge-in-july%20(1).png 
""It has been one of the best months we had because of the massive price return in most of our investments. Most of the performance has been led by the govvie, Treasury rates,"" said Pascal Perrone, portfolio manager at Eric Sturdza Investments. 
Inflation-linked bonds led the rally. Governments' ""real"" 10-year borrowing costs, which strip out the effects of anticipated inflation, tumbled to record lows, dropping around 30 basis points in Germany and the United States. 
Payouts for such bonds rise or fall in line with inflation over the life of the instrument, making them an important hedge against rising prices. 
U.S. inflation-protected securities, known as TIPS, attracted a record $3.2 billion of inflows in the week to Wednesday, after data earlier in July showed consumer prices at 5%, rising at the fastest pace in 13 years.
Germany's 10-year real yield is set for its biggest monthly fall since July 2012, when then-ECB President Mario Draghi promised to do ""whatever it takes"" to tide the euro zone over its debt crisis and preserve the euro.
July marked another seminal moment for euro zone debt as the ECB pledged to keep rates at record lows for even longer to meet its new symmetrical inflation target and said it would tolerate temporary overshoots of that target.
But record low real yields are often seen as a worrying sign, as they reflect a pessimistic view on future economic growth, which is why many bond bears remain undeterred because they expect a big bounceback for economic growth this year. 
Graphic: Real yields: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkvlgmaggpb/realyield.PNG 
Fifteen of the 23 banks and asset managers canvassed by Reuters said they still expect 10-year U.S. yields to end 2021 around 2%.

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and BofA both predicted 10-year German yields at just below 0% by year-end, from -0.45% now.

1163,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 11:21AM ET</span>",Daimler to keep 35% stake as trucks business goes solo,"By Christoph Steitz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Daimler will keep a 35% stake in the trucks division it plans to spin off this year, the luxury carmaker said on Friday, giving more details on a landmark corporate split it hopes will boost share values.
The spinoff of Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck Holding AG as a separate listed entity, first announced in February, will be voted on by Daimler shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on Oct. 1.
They will receive one share in the trucks division for every two Daimler shares they own.
Daimler, in turn, will be renamed Mercedes-Benz Group AG to reflect its focus on the car and van business, including the Mercedes-Benz brand, and efforts to challenge Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other rivals in the market for electric premium cars.
""Daimler's realignment makes one success story into two,"" Daimler Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius said.
""With this courageous step into a new future, we are creating added value with two pure-play companies for our customers, employees, shareholders and partners.""
Daimler will provide Daimler Truck Holding AG with net liquidity of 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) until the end of the year, when the truckmaker's shares are expected to start trading, so that it can achieve an investment-grade rating.
Spin-offs, under which existing shareholders get shares in the new vehicle for free, have been a prominent way for large corporations to unlock value and respond to investors demanding a sharper business model.
Daimler shares are up about 17% since the spin-off announcement, in line with the broader European automotive sector.
""Up until now, we had to travel in a convoy. In the future, we will be able to plan our own route and choose the best route for us,"" said Martin Daum, designated chief executive of Daimler Truck Holding AG.
Of the 35% Daimler plans to retain in the division, which is the world's largest truck and bus maker and will be a contender for Germany's blue-chip DAX index, 5% will be transferred to the carmaker's pension fund.

As of Jan. 1 2021, Daimler Truck Holding AG shareholders' equity on a pro-forma basis stood at about 11.1 billion euros, equivalent to an equity ratio of 22%, Daimler said.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 11:16AM ET</span>","Exchange operator Cboe tops profit view, grows footprint","By John McCrank and Niket Nishant
(Reuters) -Cboe Global Markets Inc on Friday reported second-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations, helped by both transactional and non-transactional revenues from the exchanges it operates around the globe, ahead of more overseas expansion.
Excluding one-time items, such as acquisition costs, Cboe earned $1.38 per share, 2 cents above the mean analyst estimate, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
A soft spot during the quarter was in U.S. equities, where more volume moved to off-exchange trading venues and overall industry volumes were down 15% from a year earlier, as the spike in trading after the start of coronavirus pandemic began to normalize. Cboe runs four U.S. stock exchanges.
Cboe's revenues from options trading, futures trading, global foreign exchange trading, and European equities - which benefited from the July 2020 acquisition of pan-European clearinghouse EuroCCP - all saw gains. 
The Chicago-based company said it won regulatory approvals this month for its new European derivatives market, which is on track to go live on Sept. 6. It said it was moving forward with plans to launch a new equities block-trading venue in Canada in February 2022.
""Our overall business in Europe was exceptionally strong in the second quarter, and we expect the launch of Cboe Europe derivatives to build on this momentum,"" Cboe Chief Executive Officer Ed Tilly said on a call with analysts.
Net income dipped 2% from a year earlier, to $105.2 million, or 98 cents per share, from $113.3 million, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier, largely due to the softness in U.S. equities. 
Cboe recorded a 19% jump in operating expenses, mainly related to compensation, benefits and other professional fees.

Total revenue, excluding costs, rose 18% to $350.6 million.
Cboe shares were up 2.67% at $118.62 in early trading.

(Reuters) -Drugmaker  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) on Friday raised its 2021 profit forecast on expectations that a rapid uptick in demand for its Botox anti-wrinkle injection due to the easing of COVID-19 curbs would continue for the rest of the year. 
Sales of the drug for cosmetic uses rose two-fold to $584 million in the second quarter, trouncing analysts' estimates of $483 million as vaccinations encouraged people to resume non-essential procedures after being holed up at home for months. 
The company acquired the drug last year as part of its $63 billion purchase of Allergan (NYSE:AGN). Company executives said on an earnings call that sales of products gained through the deal were on track to outpace Allergan's historical performance. 
Increased investment in Botox and other aesthetic products is helping boost demand, Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez said. 
""About two-thirds of the performance, I think, is fundamental demand and maybe one-third of it is pent-up demand,"" Gonzalez added.
The company forecast full-year adjusted earnings between $12.52 and $12.62 per share, compared with $12.37 to $12.57 per share previously. Analysts expected 2021 earnings per share of $12.61, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
AbbVie also reported a 4.8% rise in quarterly sales of its best-selling drug Humira to $5.07 billion, roughly in line with expectations.
But sales of the drug, which is facing rivals in Europe, fell 6% on a reported basis in international markets while rising 7.1% in the United States.
AbbVie said the recent approval of Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Alzheimer's disease drug had increased interest in treatments that clear brain plaques, a likely contributor to the disease.

The company expects to start testing a drug for Alzheimer's that works on the same mechanism by the end of the year or early next year.
Its shares were 1.7% lower at $116.88 in early trading.

(Reuters) - German healthcare group Fresenius raised 2021 targets though it saw a weaker third quarter, saying progress on its cost-cutting plan should offset troubles at its dialysis unit.
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected healthcare groups in different ways as demand for coronavirus-related products and services coincided with the evolution of new coronavirus variants and higher rates of patient deaths.
Fresenius said that while it earlier expected lower pandemic effects in late 2021, new coronavirus variants and exposure to high-risk patients at its dialysis unit Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE:FMS) could threaten those assumptions in the third quarter.
""We obviously need to watch the further development and the related knock-on effects of the pandemic here very closely,"" Fresenius' chief executive Stephan Sturm said in a conference call on Friday.
However, higher 2021 numbers are still possible thanks to better-than-expected savings from Fresenius' cost-cutting plan, Sturm said.
""For starters, we expect low double-digit million euro savings already this year,"" the CEO said.
At the same time, the company still did not specify savings measures for FMC (NYSE:FMC), saying it would issue an update in autumn.
Earlier this year, Fresenius sparked speculation it might divest the unit, but Sturm dismissed that possibility on May 21.
""FMC gets us more scale, a higher level of attractiveness in the debt markets and advantages on the tax front,"" Sturm said on Friday, adding Fresenius is still analyzing its group structure and may give a further update in February.

In a statement released earlier on Friday, Fresenius said it now saw 2021 net income growing in a low single-digit percentage range and kept expected revenue growth at a low to medium single-digit percentage range, both in constant currency. In May, it said it expected at least broadly stable net income.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will not process registrations of securities by Chinese companies unless they provide disclosures on the implications of a regulatory crackdown by Beijing and other risks, the agency said on Friday, confirming an exclusive https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-us-regulator-freezes-chinese-company-ipos-over-risk-disclosures-2021-07-30 Reuters report.
The following is an outline of three categories of risks that SEC Chair Gary Gensler says all China-based operating companies seeking to register securities with the SEC - either directly or through a shell company - must disclose about their businesses before the agency gives the nod to list shares on U.S. exchanges: 
OFFSHORE STRUCTURES 
In a number of sectors in China, companies are not allowed to have foreign ownership and cannot directly list on overseas exchanges. Many China-based operating companies therefore raise money overseas through an offshore entity that then contracts with the China-based operating company - a structure that creates additional legal risks for investors. 
The SEC said Chinese issuers must disclose that U.S. investors are purchasing shares of a shell company, not shares of a China-based operating company, that maintains service agreements with the associated operating company. 
CHINA GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE 
Given Beijing's tight grip on the U.S. economy and markets, the SEC will require that Chinese companies disclose that they face ""uncertainty about future actions by the government of China that could significantly affect the operating company's financial performance"" and the enforceability of certain contractual arrangements. They must also disclose whether the shell company and its investors are affected by these risks.
The regulator will also require disclosure in cases when an operating company and the issuer may have received or were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges. Companies must spell out the risks that such approval could be denied or rescinded.
OTHER RISKS

Companies must also tell investors that the 2020 Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which requires that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board be permitted to inspect the issuer's public accounting firm within three years, may result in the delisting of the operating company in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect the firm.
Companies will be also subject to targeted additional reviews of filings for companies with significant China-based operations, the SEC said.

(Reuters) - Rick Ornelas got into  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD)'s initial public offering (IPO) every way he could.
As a user of the trading app, the Houston-based author of life-coaching books applied for and received 50 Robinhood shares in its IPO. When the shares traded down more than 10% in their debut on Thursday, he doubled down by acquiring 75 more shares through Fidelity Investments, where he holds his main trading account. 
""I know IPO shares can be volatile, but I just don't want to miss the opportunity in case this pops. I believe in the company's long-term valuation,"" Ornelas said.
More than a fifth of Robinhood's $2.1 billion IPO was snapped up by the app's users such as Ornelas. Some put on a brave face after Robinhood shares ended their first day of trading down 8.4%, valuing the company at $29 billion. 
Many of the retail investors who drove the Robinhood app's meteoric rise did not come through for its IPO, however. They cited concerns over its frothy valuation, the risk of regulators cracking down on Robinhood's business, and lingering anger with the company's imposition of trading curbs when the 'meme' stock trading frenzy flared in January. [L1N2P405G]
Mike Reed, one of the Robinhood customers who participated in the IPO, said he was staying the course. He bought 26 shares at the IPO price of $38 and placed an order to sell them once the share price hits $72. The shares closed at $34.82 on Thursday instead.
""I was hoping it would end up in a little more positive territory,"" said Reed, who works for a cybersecurity firm in Austin, Texas. 
A Robinhood spokesperson declined to respond to a request for comment.
Many IPOs benefit from excluding retail investors, who end up fueling a first-day trading pop by snapping up shares in the open market. By letting many retail investors under the IPO tent, Robinhood made big gains less likely for investors on the first day. Also weighing on the shares was Robinhood's modification of the traditional six-month IPO lock-up that allowed insiders to sell 15% of their shares straight away. 
Some investors drew similarities with the IPO of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) in 2012. That IPO was also offered at $38 per share and a quarter of it was snapped up by retail investors. The stock plunged on its second day of trading and took more than a year to get back up to its IPO price. It handsomely rewarded the investors who stuck with it - Facebook is now worth more than nine times its IPO price.

Benhamish Allen, a 42-year-old teacher from California, said he borrowed to invest in Robinhood shares, a risky practice known as investing on margin that can amplify losses as well as profits, based on how a stock performs. He said he would stick with Robinhood's shares for now.
""I never sell stocks when they're lower than what I bought them for,"" Allen said.

U.S.-listed stock of the Toronto, Ontario-based restaurant chain rose 4% as it also said it would repurchase about $1 billion of its shares over the next two years.
Several U.S. restaurant chains, including KFC parent Yum Brands and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), have been investing in their loyalty programs and launching new menu items to boost sales at a time when dining in at restaurants is bouncing back.
Restaurant Brands' Popeyes brand rolled out its first-ever rewards program in June to tackle competition from McDonald's and KFC, while its Burger King brand launched its own hand-breaded fried chicken sandwich this year.
""(The) chicken sandwich continues to show healthy volumes in restaurants around the country, double the previous chicken sandwich, and has expanded Burger King's demographic attracting ... those with higher incomes and spending power,"" Chief Executive Officer Jose Cil said in an earning call.
Comparable sales at Burger King in the United States increased 13% from a year earlier, above estimates of 12.3% and pre-pandemic levels two years ago.
Total revenue for Restaurant Brands jumped 37% from a year earlier to $1.44 billion, beating Refinitiv IBES estimates of $1.37 billion.
Net income attributable to common shareholders more than doubled to $259 million, or 84 cents per share. Excluding items, it earned 77 cents per share, beating 62 cents estimates.

The better-than-expected results came even as Popeyes posted a surprise decline in comparable sales and Tim Hortons missed Wall Street expectations due to coronavirus curbs in Canada.
Cil, however, said sales at Tim Hortons have improved sequentially in July, with Ontario, which houses nearly half of its restaurants, relaxing curbs on eateries.

(Reuters) -Michael Kors parent Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) Ltd on Friday raised its annual forecasts for the second time after trouncing Wall Street estimates for quarterly results, as shoppers splurge on its high-end clothes and bags.
The global luxury goods industry is betting that a resumption of social events and parties following speedy vaccinations will encourage more shoppers to spend on fashion after being stuck at home for more than a year.
Shares rose as much as 16% as revenue at Michael Kors nearly tripled, making it the biggest boost to total sales and signaling a recovery from pandemic lows.
""While it is clear, the world will continue to see challenges as the global pandemic evolves, including regional closures and temporary restrictions, ...the ultimate path to recovery remains strong"", said Chief Executive John Idol.
The company's European peers Louis Vuitton-owner LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) have also reported a rebound.
LVMH posted record profitability and revenue at its Fendi, Loewe and Celine brands, while Kering said Yves Saint Laurent had reached a critical scale with sales bouncing back in all regions.
Capri, meanwhile, raised its forecast for annual revenue to about $5.3 billion, just about a month after predicting $5.15 billion, while warning that the Delta variant could dampen some expectations around a quick recovery in Europe. 
However, its outlook did not account for any significant additional store shutdowns, extension of closures or fresh government curbs that could hurt traffic and sales trends.

The Versace and Jimmy Choo owner forecast annual adjusted profit to be about $4.50 per share, higher than the $3.80 to $3.90 range predicted earlier.
Overall revenue nearly tripled to $1.25 billion in the first quarter compared to a year ago when stores were largely shut. Excluding items, the company earned a better-than-expected $1.42 per share.

""Having obtained updated valuations of its legal advisors, (RCS) has decided that the conditions for the recording of provisions for risks do not exist,"" the company said in its first-half results statement.
Last month, Blackstone requested a court in New York to merge two lawsuits related to the disputed property sale, while seeking damages for more than $600 million from the Italian company.
RCS said on Friday the damage request was ""based on general and unsubstantiated allegations"".
The publisher of influential daily Corriere della Sera launched arbitration proceedings in late 2018 to nullify the 2013 sale to Blackstone, saying the U.S. investment firm had paid too low a price at a time when RCS faced financial difficulties.
Blackstone, which paid 120 million euros ($142.5 million) for the offices, in turn accused RCS of falsely claiming it still owns the building and of improperly blocking its sale to Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) but the case in the U.S. was suspended until the arbitration outcome.

In May, a Milan arbitral tribunal ruled in favour of Blackstone, rejecting all claims by RCS.

There was a rotation into cyclical stocks this year, but don't count growth out yet. There are still plenty of growth stocks that are trading at attractive valuations such as Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD) and Jabil (JBL).According to the investment media's stock market narrative, money justly moved out of tech and growth stocks toward value stocks after an epic bull run during the thick of the pandemic. Though the talking heads on the top financial networks often point to specific reasons for the rise and fall of specific groups of stocks and the overarching market, the truth is that market movement is often difficult to explain.
If the mainstream investment media's narrative is true and the pendulum rightfully swung in favor of value stocks following the influx of money into tech as the pandemic roared, it is only a matter of time until the pendulum swings back. The bottom line is money will gravitate toward growth stocks in the long run, simply because growth stocks have considerable upside.
Below, I provide an in-depth look at two growth stocks investors should take a look at in the days, weeks, and months ahead. These two stocks are Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD) and Jabil (JBL).

However, given that it could still be some time before VTRS becomes a viable growth company, is the stock worth betting on now? Let’s find out.
Global pharmaceutical company Viatris Inc. (VTRS) manufactures and distributes complex generic drugs, biosimilars, and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) worldwide. The company was created in November 2020 from  Pfizer  Inc.’s (NYSE:PFE) generic medicine unit’s (Upjohn Business) spin-off and its merger with Mylan (NASDAQ:VTRS) N.V., a specialty pharmaceuticals company. VTRS is based in Canonsburg, Pa.
VTRS’ diverse global portfolio and progress in advancing key pipeline programs have accelerated the company’s sales and growth opportunities. In addition, its new product launches helped it generate $163 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2021.
The stock has gained 5.7% over the past three months on the news of tentative FDA approval of its new drug application. But its shares are down 24.1% year-to-date and 11.9% over the past year. The stock is now trading 24.2% below its all-time high of $18.86. While the recent FDA approval of its first interchangeable biosimilar product has helped the stock attract investor attention, the company has incurred significant operating losses in its last reported quarter due to higher expenses. Since rapid growth and profitability are unlikely to be in the picture for the stock, we think its near-term prospects look uncertain now.

During this period, the tech index was down by 9% while the other indices were up by 6%, 8%, and down 3% respectively. Of course, this followed many months during which the Nasdaq composite was the clear leader as many tech stocks saw an incredible surge in earnings and revenue due to the pandemic.
However, the Nasdaq has resumed its leadership role since mid-May with a 13.8% gain. One major catalyst for this outperformance is the drop in longer-term rates which has correlated to lower growth expectations. This tends to lead to money moving from value, cyclical, and financial stocks into tech and growth stocks which are heavily represented in the Nasdaq. Additionally, there were concerns that tech stocks would see a decline in earnings due to elevated comps from the pandemic.

PARIS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -An easing of coronavirus travel restrictions is generating the first signs of recovery at Air France-KLM, the airline group said on Friday, as its unveiled a smaller loss for the second quarter coupled with positive cash from operations.
While passengers are returning to the air, uncertainty over COVID-19 rules continues to be a problem. KLM said with a majority of Europeans now fully vaccinated, countries should move quickly to harmonize regulations enabling more air travel.
""Obviously the first quarter was terrible and probably even more so for KLM due to the very specific measure of double testing,"" Pieter Elbers, head of the group's Dutch unit, said in an interview, referring to a requirement in the Netherlands for passengers to provide two negative tests on return flights. 
""In the second (quarter) we see a significant improvement. We see the numbers picking up even within the second quarter, June was better than April and in July, the first week of July, Amsterdam was the busiest airport in Europe,"" he told Reuters. 
But Elbers said people are still reluctant to travel and called for European countries to reopen the borders.
The Franco-Dutch group posted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 248 million euros ($294.57 million) for the quarter - marking a 532-million-euro improvement from heavy losses a year earlier when the pandemic had triggered global lockdowns.
Third-quarter EBITDA is expected to be positive, it said, adding its medium-term operating margin goal remained unchanged.
Air France-KLM shares rose less than 1% in early trading.
With long-haul capacity rising again following the reopening of the North Atlantic to Americans visiting Europe, Air France-KLM now expects capacity at 60%-70% of 2019 levels in the third quarter, compared with 55%-65% estimated in May.
In contrast, British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) took a more cautious bet, saying summer capacity would rise to 45% of pre-pandemic levels.
With U.S.-bound travel still closed to the majority of Europeans, Air France-KLM, however, held back from giving capacity forecasts for the fourth quarter and called for reciprocity in the opening of borders as well as faster vaccination rollouts worldwide.
While Americans are slowly returning to Europe, Elbers said, ""I hope that also the U.S. will open its borders soon again and we can see a further uptick of travel. If I see the trend of the past few months, we can really be kind of positive.""
For the first time since the start of the crisis, operating free cashflow after lease repayments was positive at 210 million euros. Both of its main carriers were cash-positive on the back of rising ticket sales.
The group sees ""good"" summer bookings in Europe, though they are coming in later than usual, Chief Financial Officer Steven Zaat said.
The airline's revenue surged to 2.75 billion euros from 1.57 billion euros.

Fuel costs rose by about 300 million euros, mainly due to the extra capacity as well as a slight impact from rises in oil prices, cushioned by more favourable hedge contracts.

MILAN (Reuters) - Unicredit (MI:CRDI) is well placed to secure a beneficial deal with the Italian government in talks to take over Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which it sees as the best M&A option at present, its chief executive Andrea Orcel said. 
Orcel defended the merits of a possible MPS acquisition as UniCredit posted a higher than expected second-quarter net profit, a day after agreeing to enter exclusive negotiations over the bailed-out rival.
Italy's No.2 bank said late on Thursday it had signed an accord with the Treasury setting guidelines for a potential takeover of MPS, in which Rome owns 64% having rescued it in 2017 at a cost of 5.4 billion euros ($6.4 billion). 
UniCredit, which had long rebuffed government pressure to buy MPS, said it would only acquire ""selected parts"" of the lender in a deal that would leave its capital buffers unchanged while boosting earnings per share by a double-digit percentage.
Discussions will unfold over the next few weeks with a decision expected by mid-September, Chief Executive Andrea Orcel, who took over in April, said.
""We feel strongly that, with the principles we have highlighted, given the timing and the ability to (select what we buy), Monte dei Paschi is the best option, and the only option on the table at this point,"" he told analysts. 
Orcel said the deal would allow significant cost cuts and boost UniCredit's market position in Italy, where it has fallen behind Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) which last year snatched rival UBI to become Italy's biggest bank.
""Not only MPS would come at the right terms if the principles we have agreed are upheld, but also help us rebalance our presence in Italy towards the centre-north ... away from (the country's poorer) centre-south, and that is healthy.""
UniCredit would be shielded from legal risks weighing on MPS following years of mismanagement and would not take on any problem loans or performing loans it deems too risky.
""The terms set out for negotiations tick all of the boxes for the equity market to potentially like a final deal,"" broker Autonomous said.
Shares in UniCredit rose 2.5% by 1230 GMT. MPS surged 7%. 
MPS faces a capital shortfall of up to 2.5 billion euros and banking stress test results due later on Friday are set to turn the spotlight on to its frail finances.
IMPROVED OUTLOOK 
On Friday UniCredit improved its 2021 outlook for loan loss charges, after lower-than-expected provisions, as well as higher revenue, drove second-quarter profit above market forecasts.
UniCredit now expects its 2021 underlying net profit, excluding one-off items, to be above 3 billion euros versus a previous estimate of around 3 billion, while it stuck to revenue and cost targets.
Net profit for the April-June period came in at 1.03 billion euros versus a company-provided analysts' average estimate of 736 million.
That compares with 420 million euros a year earlier, when the group wrote down loans to the tune of 937 million euros to prepare for the fallout from the pandemic.
Loan-loss provisions totalled 360 million euros in the period, below the 647 million euros analysts had estimated. 
UniCredit said it now expects its cost of risk, which measures provisions against loan volumes, to be below 50 basis points, compared with below 70 basis points forecast earlier.
Shrinking loan losses also helped drive profits at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Santander (MC:SAN) earlier this week.
Revenue totalled 4.4 billion euros, above an average 4.3 billion analyst forecast, with fees rebounding by 21% from a year ago when Italy enforced a strict lockdown to fight the pandemic.
Higher fees and trading income more than offset the yearly decline in interest income.
Profit from the core lending business, long a sore spot for UniCredit, edged higher from the previous quarter thanks to the contribution from funds borrowed at negative rates from the European Central Bank as well as a pick-up in volumes. 
UniCredit has pledged to boost its lending business, with Orcel - hired after predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier fell out with the board over strategy - saying a phase of ""active retrenchment"" for the bank was now over.

Investing.com – Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock was trading 2.5% higher after the company rode higher sales, more volumes and increases in its product prices to beat all estimates for the fourth quarter.
Traders seemed to look through its warning of higher commodity costs and freight costs for the ongoing financial year.
A 7% rise in net sales to $18.9 billion resulted in the Ariel detergent maker to beat analysts’ estimate of $18.37 billion.
The company benefited from higher sales of its costlier products. This happened with the company’s health care segment and skin and personal care category, where products typically carry prices higher than company-average selling prices.
The company raised product prices to pass on higher costs of raw materials that go into making its products. 
Year-on-year changes in sales of different category of products varied from geography to geography and where those economies stood last year and where they are now, depending on the Covid situation and the level of lockdown.
So as work resumed and more people started to go to offices and meet friends and relatives, sales of Head & Shoulders shampoo and grooming products like Gillette shaving blades and cream bounced back.
But sales of appliances fell as they had increased disproportionately last year when people stayed home and indulged in do-it-yourself activities.
Diluted net earnings per share were $1.13 for the quarter, a 6% increase versus the prior year reported EPS due to a 4% increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding. It was ahead of the $1.09 that analysts expected.
Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer Jon Moeller, who replaces David Taylor as President and Chief Executive Officer from November 1, has his targets cut out.
P&G expects sales in the ongoing financial year to come between $77.62 billion and $79.14, growing by 2%-4% from 2021 levels.

PARIS (Reuters) -France's biggest listed lender BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) joined rivals to slash provisions for unpaid loans, as they cashed in on unprecedented government support to keep the economy afloat during the coronavirus pandemic.
Although the virus continues to loom over the global economy, billions of euros of state handouts across Europe, from worker furlough schemes to assistance for businesses, have helped borrowers keep up repayments, shielding banks' profits.
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Laurent Bonnafe said he was preparing for a ""solid recovery"" after the euro zone's biggest lender on Friday reported a 26.6% jump in second-quarter net income. 
The government ended France’s third national lockdown in mid-May and has been gradually relaxing other restrictions since.
Like other European countries, France borrows to pay for public spending, which it has ramped up dramatically during the pandemic.
The national public auditor has said Paris should gradually withdraw COVID-19 support this year and next but only turn to cut its budget deficit from 2023. 
This would postpone any economic hangover from the pandemic, a boon to borrowers and banks, as well as their shareholders.
Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA), Russia's second-largest lender VTB, and Britain's NatWest have similarly cut provisions for soured credit, banking on an economic improvement.
""Clearly they are benefiting from massive state support. It is support for the economy, the borrowers. So they benefit indirectly,"" said Jerome Legras of Axiom Alternative Investments.
BNP Paribas posted a net profit of 2.91 billion euros as its cost of risk, reflecting provisions for bad loans, fell 43.8% to 813 million euros. 
Revenue rose 0.9%, as a 9.5% rebound in retail banking helped make up for lower corporate and investment banking sales.
The pandemic has also influenced the behaviour of its customers. Deposits, for instance, rose by 7.5% compared with a year earlier, as lockdowns made it harder to spend, while loans were up by 4%.
Lockdowns and curfews accelerated a shift to online banking, with a jump of a quarter in daily connections to mobile apps, the bank said. 
The general improvement in retail banking helped offset a slump of more than 40% in earnings in fixed income, currencies and commodities trading.
In corporate banking, where BNP Paribas has been making a push on advising clients on mergers, revenue was down 1.6%, lagging Wall Street rivals.

The bank said business volumes in finance raised for clients on credit, bond and equity markets was down 37%.
It also said it would pay shareholders an additional dividend of 1.55 euro per share this year, and its shares, up about a fifth this year, rose again on Friday, though lagged the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index.

Magnit, which on Thursday reported a drop in quarterly net profit of 6%, is trying to close the gap on market leader X5 and finalised its purchase of rival Dixy earlier this month for 87.6 billion roubles ($1.2 billion).
The ready-to-eat project has been launched in two Russian cities, with around 40 items available at almost 50 stores, and Magnit said it would decide on expansion plans once the pilot was complete. 
Ruslan Ismailov, Magnit's deputy CEO and director for retail chain management, said the retailer wanted to tap into the rapid rise in popularity of ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook items and that it planned to ramp up its production capacities.
""We're also looking for alternative ways to develop the project, including, among other things, via construction of our own 'kitchen factories',"" Ismailov said in a statement. 
Russian food delivery services are exploring dark kitchens and stores, which bypass restaurants and high-street shops to cater directly to online customers, to meet growing demand.

""Although there are signs that the supply bottlenecks for semiconductors are beginning to ease, we expect a very challenging third quarter from a supply perspective,"" Alexander Seitz, chief financial officer of VW's namesake brand, said.
Volkswagen had said on Thursday that lost production due to the crisis, which started to hit the automotive industry at the end of 2020, currently stood at a high six digit number of vehicles.
Volkswagen still managed to crank out record profits for the first half of 2021, favouring high-margin Porsches and Audis in its allocation of chips, a key component in modern vehicles.

LONDON (Reuters) -British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) said summer capacity would rise to 45% of pre-pandemic levels, a more cautious bet than rivals as its transatlantic business has yet to fully reopen. 
IAG's 45% Q3 capacity plan is a significant jump over the 22% it flew in the March-June quarter, but puts it some way behind Air France-KLM, easyJet (LON:EZJ) and Ryanair, which IAG's CEO blamed on the partial closure of the U.S. market. 
""The weight of our network is balanced to the Atlantic,"" Chief Executive Luis Gallego told reporters on Friday, adding that it was possible that IAG would beat its 45% plan this quarter.
""That's what we think we are going to fly, but we are ready to fly more,"" he said. 
For the October-December quarter, IAG was ready to fly up to 75% of its 2019 capacity, he said. 
British Airways, usually IAG's most profitable airline, has been hammered by restrictions in its home market that have been tighter and lasted longer than those in Europe, allowing the group's Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling to recover faster.
They are set to fly around 70% of their capacity this summer, showing how UK restrictions and last minute rule changes have dragged on BA. 
Britain will lift more restrictions on arrivals from the United States on Monday, allowing a partial reopening of the transatlantic, but the United States continues to be closed to UK and European arrivals.
Shares in IAG traded down 3% in early deals. The stock has gained 24% over the last six months. 
""Further opening up of the U.S. market during Q3, which may yet happen, would be a significant catalyst for the stock,"" said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska. 
Air France-KLM, which compared to BA has benefited from the earlier opening of Europe to U.S. passengers, said on Friday it expected third quarter capacity at 60-70% of 2019 levels. 
Short-haul rivals EasyJet and Ryanair are also ahead of IAG, aiming for 60% summer capacity and July passenger numbers at two-thirds of 2019 levels respectively.
Low levels of flying due to ongoing pandemic restrictions meant that for the three months to the end of June, IAG reported an underlying operating loss of 1.045 billion euros ($1.24 billion), in line with a consensus forecast for a 1.036 billion euros loss. 
The group declined to give a profit forecast, citing COVID-19 uncertainty. It said it had liquidity of 10.2 billion euros and it continued to preserve cash by reducing its cost base. 

Asked if there could be further redundancies after BA last year announced more than 10,000 jobs would go, Gallego said that was not what he expected, but that he would like to see the UK furlough scheme extended to the end of 2021.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has submitted a new audit report to India's central bank, it told Reuters, as it seeks to overturn a ban on card issuance linked to concerns over the U.S. giant's handling of data processed abroad.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on July 14 sent panic-waves through Indian banking partners by announcing a ban, effective from July 22, to prevent the U.S. giant from issuing new cards. It cited non-compliance with 2018 rules that required it to store payments data only in India.
The RBI imposed the ban after deciding a ""system audit report"" submitted by Mastercard's auditor Deloitte in April was unsatisfactory, three sources familiar with its decision-making said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Two of the sources said the RBI was reviewing the new report.
In a statement to Reuters, Mastercard said Deloitte performed a ""supplemental audit"" and a new report was submitted on July 20 to the RBI, six days after the ban was announced.
""We look forward to continuing our conversations with the RBI and reinforcing how seriously we take our obligations. We are hopeful that this latest filing provides the assurances required to address their concerns,"" it said.
Deloitte declined to comment, citing confidentiality obligations. The RBI did not respond to a request for comment.
The sources said the RBI was concerned Deloitte's audit did not clearly state how long Mastercard took to purge Indians' card data that is processed abroad before being stored locally.
India's 2018 rules do not restrict where the data is processed, but for ""unfettered supervisory access"", the RBI mandates that within a day the data - including transaction details and amount - should be stored domestically.
Mastercard in 2018 said it had started storing data at a facility in India's western city of Pune to comply. But it still processes a part of each Indian transaction through data centres abroad, and later transfers and stores that data in Pune, one of the sources said.
The RBI has given no details beyond a seven-line statement announcing the ban. The details of RBI's concern with Deloitte's submissions have not previously been reported.
 American Express  (NYSE:AXP), whose Indian presence is much smaller than that of Mastercard and Visa (NYSE:V), has also has been banned from issuing new cards since April for violating the 2018 rules. 

A fourth person with direct knowledge of the matter said the RBI had given Mastercard multiple extensions to submit clarifications and RBI only issued the ban when Mastercard asked for more time when an extension to July 9 lapsed.
Mastercard did not comment on the extension and the situation in Pune.

""I think you can count on the U.S. to be back for the long term,"" CEO Nicolas Hieronimus, a L'Oreal veteran who took the helm in May, told analysts.
On Thursday the group reported second-quarter sales growth of 33.5%, boosted by strong U.S. and Chinese markets. The cosmetics giant, and high-end fashion labels like LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP), have benefited from booming demand in both countries over the past quarter, marking a strong recovery and pushing past pre-pandemic levels lifted by pent-up demand as shops reopen.
U.S. consumption has recovered faster than in Europe, with perfume and make-up bouncing back strongly as socialising resumes, L'Oreal said.
The group has been working on boosting its e-commerce offering and rebalancing activities in the country, beefing up its skin care business, with its La Roche Posay label leading competitors in prescription skin care, Hieronimus said.

He added that the group aims to gain market share in the United States.

1200,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 06:54AM ET</span>",Pinterest Tanks 20% As Users Ditch DIY For Life Outside,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock plunged 20% in Friday’s premarket trading as people preferred to spend more time at reopened theaters, malls and restaurants after a year on social media platforms.
The company admitted that it “disproportionately benefited from increased time spent at home during pandemic lockdowns” as people took to its ‘do-it-yourself’ recipes for cooking and gardening.   
In the U.S., its biggest market that accounts for around a fifth of the global base, monthly active users (MAU) fell 5% from a year ago in the second quarter. MAU is a key metric to judge where the traffic is going on social media.
The company attributed much of the decline to web users who tend to be less engaged.
Engagement headwinds on Pinterest have continued in July. As of July 27, U.S. MAUs have declined approximately 7% and global MAUs have grown approximately 5% year-over-year, down from 9% during the second quarter.
The company tried to assuage concerns, saying that shopping engagement continued to be more resilient, search rates remained elevated and “finally Gen Z Pinners continued to be highly engaged”.
Pinterest swung to a profit of $69.41 million in the June quarter from a loss of $100.74 million a year earlier. Total revenue more than doubled to $613 million and came in ahead of analysts’ expectations of $562 million."
1201,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 06:53AM ET</span>","Nasdaq Futures 150 Pts Lower; Amazon, Pinterest Results Drag","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Friday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperforming after disappointing results from e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) late on Thursday.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 75 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 25 points, or 0.6%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures underperformed, dropping 150 points, or 1%.
That said, this has been a generally positive month for the major indices, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.6%, the broad-based S&P 500 up 2.8% and the NASDAQ Composite 1.9% higher.
This has been the busiest week for quarterly corporate earnings so far, and the deluge continued after the close on Wall Street Thursday with numbers from Amazon setting the tone.
The online retailer, one of the big winners of the pandemic, saw its extraordinary sales growth start to slow, with revenue growing only 27% in the second quarter, down from 44% in the first quarter.  It fell even more to the 'mid-teens' in the period after its Prime Day marketing event.
This resulted in a number of brokerages, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Piper Sandler and UBS (SIX:UBSG), cutting their price targets, a rare event in an age of almost universal enthusiasm for Internet platform stocks. The stock has fallen more than 6% premarket.
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock slumped 18% premarket after the social media platform saw overall monthly active users fall short of expectations, creating concerns that the end of social distancing restrictions could see the gains made during that period disappear.
The onslaught of earnings continues Friday, with oil giant  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) reporting its highest profit in six quarters and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) reporting a sharp rise in second-quarter profit. Other results are due from the likes of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), among others. 
The economic data slate Friday includes the second-quarter employment cost index, widely seen as the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, personal income and spending for June and the final July University of Michigan consumer sentiment index. Investors will be looking for signs of economic recovery after Thursday’s GDP number showed 6.5% growth in the second quarter.
Earlier Friday, the Eurozone economy expanded 2% in the second quarter of this year, exiting the recession of the previous two quarters.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Friday, but are set to end the second consecutive week higher as investors remained confident about the global demand recovery.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $73.39 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $74.86, but both contracts are set for gains of around 2% for the week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,827.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1898.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>","Renault sees 2021 profit despite chip crunch, raw material costs","By Nick Carey and Gilles Guillaume
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) said on Friday it expected to deliver a full-year 2021 profit even as a global shortage in semiconductor chips and rising raw material costs crimped production.
Renault said it now expected the chip shortage to lead to a production loss of 200,000 units this year, doubling its previous forecast. 
The carmaker, which has been focusing more on its most profitable models, reported a return to half-year net profit after a hefty loss a year ago, crediting rising car sales and its pricing efforts.
Renault, which also owns Dacia and Lada brands and has a partnership with Nissan (OTC:NSANY), reported an operating margin of 2.8% for the first half of the year, saying it was aiming for a full-year margin ""of the same order"". It added it was ahead of its cost cutting targets.
Renault shares were up 1.5% at 07h47 GMT, after rising more than 4% in early trading. 
These results ""mark only the first step in our turnaround, which should accelerate with arrival of the new vehicles in preparation,"" Chief Executive Officer Luca de Meo, who started a year ago, said in a statement.
Renault almost returned to positive cash flow in the first half of the year, from a nearly 6.4 billion euro outflow in the year-ago period, and executives said they hoped to keep that momentum going. 
Renault plans to repay around a fifth of a 5 billion-euro loan from the French state by year end, Chief Finance Officer Clotilde Delbos said. The loan was part of government emergency support offered at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Last month, Renault unveiled a more ambitious strategy for electric vehicles (EVs), betting on new, affordable versions of its iconic small cars of the past to catch up with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in the fast-growing sector.
After five consecutive quarters of falling car sales, Renault's revenue for the first half of 2021 rose 18.7%.
""RENAULUTION"" PLAN
CEO De Meo, a former Volkswagen executive who turned the German automaker's Seat brand around, has been tasked with helping Renault turn a new page after a troubled spell. 
De Meo's turnaround plan - which he calls a ""Renaulution"" - includes laying off thousands of workers, cutting the carmaker's model range, and improving cooperation on production with its alliance partners - Nissan and Mitsubishi.
Former boss Carlos Ghosn was ousted and arrested in Japan in 2018 on charges of financial malpractice, which he denies. Ghosn left behind a sprawling model range with low margins, and Renault racked up heavy losses when global demand for cars fell.
The French carmaker said last month that by 2030 the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance would produce one million EVs globally a year, up from the 200,000 they made in 2020. 

Renault on Friday reported first-half net profit of 354 million euros ($420.52 million) after suffering a loss of nearly 7.3 billion euros a year earlier amid lengthy industry-wide production shutdowns during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Nissan surprised with a first-quarter profit and raised its earnings outlook on Wednesday.

1207,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 05:50AM ET</span>","Amazon Falls After Record Growth Gives Way, Spending Slows  ","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock slumped 6.0% in Friday’s premarket trading following as the company’s second-quarter revenue numbers, while robust, show signs of growth slowing.
Stimulus checks, low interest rates and fear of the virus all combined to fuel record purchases of groceries, gadgets, exercise equipment and furniture over last five quarters. A tempering of runaway sales growth numbers was expected after an unprecedented shopping binge.
But the drop to 27% growth in net sales from 44% in the first quarter of the ongoing financial year and 40% of April-June 2020 caught the market by surprise.
A push to sales by moving up Prime Day to June didn’t help much. Sales since May 15 have been up just in the mid-teens excluding Prime Day, Amazon’s Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky was quoted by Reuters as saying
Net sales came in at $113.1 billion. They were lower than analysts’ expectation of $115.33 billion, a rare miss for the company.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Piper Sandler and UBS all cut their price targets for Amazon stock, amid signs of challenging times for Chief Executive Andy Jassy who took over from Jeff Bezos only this month.   
Amazon Web Services continued to reap the benefit of shift to digital as more users went online and companies sought Cloud services to cater to their needs.
Revenue at AWS rose 37% to $14.8 billion. 
Group net income rose 48% from a year ago to $7.77 billion in the June quarter. Diluted earnings per share was higher at $15.12 and surpassed analysts’ expectation of $12.24.
Amazon now expects third-quarter net sales to be between $106 billion and $112 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 10%-16%.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 05:41AM ET</span>",Birkin bag maker Hermes tempers expectations after stellar growth,"By Silvia Aloisi and Mimosa Spencer
PARIS (Reuters) -Birkin handbag maker Hermes said it expected sales of its leather goods division to ""normalise"" after stellar growth in the first half of the year, flagging a slowdown of sorts even as it rides a sharp rebound in the luxury sector.
Hermes executives also said a half-year operating profit margin of 41% - the highest of the last decade - would not be replicated in the second part of the year, partly because the group plans to increase investments.
The luxury goods industry, which suffered an unprecedented sales contraction last year, has bounced back sharply in 2021, and sector heavyweights, such as Hermes and French rival LVMH, have weathered the crisis better than rivals.
But analysts say capitalising on pent-up demand unleashed by looser coronavirus restrictions around the world may be harder for Hermes because of its self-imposed production limits - the group prefers to have long waiting lists for its prized handbags than to accelerate production.
""Our real capacity constraint is quality, and that means having the right material and the know-how as these are labour-intensive products requiring a lot of skill,"" Executive Chairman Axel Dumas told an analyst conference call.
He said the group would stick to its policy of increasing annual sales volumes in its leather goods division by not more than 8% - even if that meant a shortage of some products.
In the three months to June, sales for the leather goods and saddlery division - which includes the $9,000-plus Birkin and Kelly handbags - more than doubled from a year ago and rose by 24% from their pre-pandemic June 2019 levels. 
""We will not have the same growth rate for leather goods (in the second half),"" Dumas said.
Overall sales at constant currencies were up 127% at 2.15 billion euros ($2.55 billion), as lockdowns eased and shoppers, particularly in Asia and the United States, flocked back to stores, allowing Hermes to run down stocks built up during the COVID-19 emergency. That was 33% above where they stood in the first half of 2019. 
The recurring operating margin, at 41% of sales, was six percentage points higher than in 2019 and matched that of industry leader LVMH's fashion and leather goods division. Dumas said that level should not used to extrapolate for the rest of the year.

He said Hermes, unlike some rivals, had not postponed investments during the health crisis and had kept renovating stores and opening new ones, including one in Tokyo in February and one in Detroit in June. The group, which traditionally opens a new manufacturing site in France every year, has hired around 400 people so far in 2021.

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 05:40AM ET</span>",China education fund tumbles after ill-timed launch,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Following an ill-timed launch, a Chinese fund that promised to offer global investors a ""golden"" opportunity to buy Chinese education stocks has dropped more than 40% this month, on track to become the country's worst-performing mutual fund in July.
Beijing last week barred tutoring for profit in core school subjects to ease financial pressure on families, a move that spooked investors in China's $120 billion private tutoring industry.
Reflecting those fears, the Bosera CSI Global China Education ETF, the country's only exchange-traded fund dedicated to the education industry, ended Friday at 0.537 yuan per fund unit, almost half the value on its June 17 debut.
The slump in the education ETF, which invests in 50 major Chinese education companies listed in New York, Hong Kong and mainland China, also underscores the risk of outbound investment products in China.
The fund's portfolio companies, including New Oriental & Technology Group and China Education Group Holdings, crashed in the wake of the the government's crackdown.
The ETF currently manages 176 million yuan ($27.25 million)worth of assets, according to Reuters calculation.
The heavy loss contrasts sharply with the fund's optimism during launch. 
The ETF, which operates under the outbound QDII scheme, allows investors to buy Chinese education companies listed globally, accessing a ""golden race track"" that benefits from policy support and growing demand, the fund manager said at the time.
The ETF's manager, Bosera Asset Management Co, declined to comment.

In an exchange statement, Bosera said the fund's unit value may suffer heavy volatility in the future and cautioned investors against risks.

Investors have spooked this year by a series of regulatory actions, often sudden, that have upended norms for companies in the tech, property and private tutoring sectors. 
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said it would fully implement planned measures aimed at ensuring overseas investors are treated no less favourably than their Chinese counterparts and which would cut the number of sectors where foreign investment has been prohibited or restricted. 
In the 2020 list released by the National Development and Reform Commission, that number of sectors was cut to 123 from 131 the previous year.

After a market rout this week, China has stepped up attempts to calm frayed investor nerves by telling foreign brokerages not to ""overinterpret"" its latest regulatory actions.
The CBIRC also said it would promote trials of and legislation for natural disaster insurance so that more types of natural disasters are included in coverage.

LONDON (Reuters) -Global education group Pearson launched a new Spotify-style ""all-you-can-eat"" college app in the United States on Friday, the centrepiece of its new digital strategy to build direct ties with learners throughout life. 
Having been buffeted by rental markets and second-hand options for once-expensive textbooks, Pearson has embarked on a direct-to-consumer strategy offering unlimited access to content to provide more reliable subscription revenues. 
Chief Executive Andy Bird, a former Disney executive who has launched the new strategy, said Pearson+ was designed to offer the same ease of use as the high-end entertainment and media apps that students are used to. 
In time it will be rolled out to markets around the world and offered to school and college students, English language learners and workers looking to develop new skills. 
""The ambition for Pearson+ is quite large. It has been designed to create what is the beginning of a digital learning ecosystem,"" Bird told reporters, adding that it could also include sections for assessments and qualifications.
Analysts at Citi said the app could boost medium-term growth. 
""As importantly, it shows that Pearson's new CEO Andy Bird is willing to be more bold than perhaps originally anticipated,"" they said in a note.
The launch came as the company reported a first-half adjusted operating profit of 127 million pounds ($177 million), in a better-than-expected rebound, with growth in sales as exams resumed and demand for online products jumped.
Its Global Online Learning sales rose 25% on strong demand for Virtual Schools enrolment in the United States. Global Assessment sales were up 34% following the cancellation of exams last year, and its U.S. Higher Education business fell by 2%.
With the Pearson+ app, students can pay $9.99 a month for a single eText, or $14.99 a month for a multi-access package. 
Bird said the group was also in advanced talks with several large companies, looking to provide training for employees. 

Pearson's shares, up almost 70% in the last nine months following six years of volatile trading, rose 0.5% in a weaker broader market.

(Reuters) - France's Vinci raised its 2021 outlook on Friday, saying sales and profit margins at its energy and construction businesses should exceed pre-pandemic levels after a strong start to the year.
The group, which also operates motorways and airports, had warned in April that its 2021 earnings would not recover to the heights of 2019, though contracting revenue may come ""very close"".
The company saw a ramp-up in its public works and civil engineering projects, benefiting from works linked to a 35 billion euro ($41.6 billion) extension of the Paris metro.
""Business levels and earnings at Vinci Energies and Vinci Construction were outstanding, exceeding levels seen in 2019,"" said Chief Executive Xavier Huillard, stipulating that at a global level earnings would not recover this year, weighed down by low traffic in its airports and concessions businesses. 
Despite returning to profit, Vinci's half-year net result reached only half that of 2019, following a year of COVID-19 restrictions across Europe that disrupted construction and stunted traffic.
Huillard added that a gradual easing of travel curbs in May had led to a rapid recovery on Vinci's motorways.
Vinci's airports arm, however, booked a core loss of 250 million euros over the period as passenger numbers remained low, with June figures down 73% compared with 2019.
However, Vinci Airports President Nicolas Notebaert told reporters that this week represented the ""first shudder"" of recovery at Gatwick airport near London as restrictions ease.
England will allow fully vaccinated visitors from the European Union and United States to arrive without needing to quarantine from next week, although travellers will still need to be tested.
Vinci's first-half core earnings beat analysts' forecasts but remained well below 2019, while sales jumped 22% and surpassed their pre-pandemic levels.

The group also approved an interim dividend of 0.65 euros per share.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Cement maker  Holcim  (SIX:HOLN) increased its guidance for full-year operating profit on Friday, saying it was looking to the impact of post-pandemic economic stimulus measures to maintain upward momentum in the global building sector.
The Swiss-based company, which recently changed its name back from LafargeHolcim (OTC:HCMLY), continued its bullish stance under Chief Executive Jan Jenisch after posting big increases in sales and profit during the first six months of 2021.
Higher volumes boosted profits as building projects resumed, with government stimulus policies expected to support further growth in the second half of the year.
Self-help in the form of efficiencies introduced last year and higher prices for its products also helped offset rising energy prices, Jenisch said.
""When the pandemic unfortunately started, we announced a fitness programme ... to focus on cash flow and also to really emerge from the crisis much fitter,"" Jenisch told journalists. 
""We have used the last year and also the first half of this year to improve the costs, and also focus on good pricing,"" Jenisch said. ""The company has never been as fit as it is today.""
During the first half its recurring operating profit margin rose to 15.8% from 11.2% a year earlier. Jenisch said such an improvement was not a one off, but was sustainable.
First-half sales rose 17.4% to 12.56 billion Swiss francs ($14 billion), while recurring operating profit (EBIT) jumped 66.1% to 1.98 billion francs.
""Holcim succeeded in posting a very strong second quarter, with broad-based regional and also segment performance,"" said Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Martin Huesler.
The company expects its growth momentum to continue in all regions during the rest of 2021, and increased its full-year guidance to see recurring EBIT rising by at least 18%, up from its previous view for a 10% increase on a like-for-like basis.
Stimulus programmes such as U.S. President Joe Biden's $2.3 trillion Build Back Better and India's National Infrastructure Pipeline will also boost activity in the building sector, it said.
Further acquisitions will follow this year after Holcim already made seven deals in the first half of the year.
It will also press on with potential divestments after agreeing to sell its businesses in Malawi, Zambia and the Indian Ocean region.
""We have an ongoing portfolio movement ... and we will shave a little bit in other regions,"" Jenisch said. [Z8N2M702F]

At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 1%.
Corporate earnings continue to take center stage in Europe, with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) reporting a 26% rise in net income in the second quarter allowing the French bank to pay an additional dividend. U.K. bank NatWest Group (LON:NWG) also used its newly-regained freedom to pay a dividend, and announced a 750 million-pound buyback program. However, this wasn’t enough to interest investors Friday, with both stocks trading lower. 
Two banks that stood out were in Italy, where UniCredit (MI:CRDI) said it had agreed the outline of a deal to buy parts of the country's long-running problem bank, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS). Unicredit stock rose over 5% after saying it had agreed with BMPS's current owner, the Italian government, that any deal should be capital-neutral for Unicredit and not expose it to legacy risks at the scandal-plagued bank.

Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) stock rose 1.4% after reporting a hefty jump in second-quarter revenue with its net loss narrowing, outperforming British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG), whose stock fell 2.7% after it predicted a cautious summer recovery, saying capacity would rise to 45% of pre-pandemic levels from 22% in the previous quarter. 
Also in France,  Iliad  (PA:ILD) shares rose 61% after founder Xavier Niel made a formal offer to take the telecoms company private.
Weighing on sentiment Friday was a disappointing earnings report from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after the close on Wall Street Thursday. The e-commerce giant missed quarterly revenue expectations for the first time in three years while providing weak guidance for the current quarter.
In economic news, French gross domestic product rose 0.9% in the three months ending in June, an improvement from the drop of 0.1% the previous quarter, while Spanish GDP soared 2.8% on the quarter, up from -0.4% last quarter. 
This sets the scene for the equivalent data from Germany and the Eurozone as a whole later in the session, with growth expected to rebound as the region’s economies reopened after the pandemic.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Nomura Holdings Inc, Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank, on Friday reported a 66% drop in first-quarter net profit due to a slowdown in the trading business and a previously flagged loss from the Archegos debacle.
April-June profit came in at 48.5 billion yen ($442.76 million), beating market expectations by 13% but down sharply from 142.5 billion yen a year earlier, when buoyant U.S. trading revenue drove the bank to its best quarterly earnings in almost two decades.
Trading revenue was weak particularly in fixed-income markets compared with the same period last year, when unprecedented volatility during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic led clients to reposition portfolios, boosting trading volume.

Nomura's rival Wall Street banks also suffered a slowdown in the pandemic-era trading boom https://www.reuters.com/business/end-trading-boom-casts-cloud-over-wall-street-bank-earnings-2021-07-15 in the last quarter, but gains from a surge in deal-making activity helped them score solid profit.
Nomura benefited from buoyant dealmaking, but its relatively small presence in the U.S. market compared with top-league investment banks limited the earnings impact of such advisory business.
As previously flagged, Nomura booked a further $600 million loss from an unidentified U.S. client, widely understood to be collapsed investment fund Archegos, bringing the total Archegos-related hit to $2.9 billion.
The wholesale segment, which houses trading and investment banking, reported a loss of 28.4 billion yen versus a profit of 87.9 billion yen a year prior.

Shares of Nomura have lost more than 20% since it revealed the Archegos loss in March, just a few days before the end of its financial year. Before the Archegos collapse, the bank had been on track for record annual profit.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 03:11AM ET</span>",Disney rejects Scarlett Johansson's complaint over 'Black Widow' streaming release,"By Lisa Richwine
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Scarlett Johansson, star of the Marvel superhero movie ""Black Widow,"" sued the Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co on Thursday, alleging that the company breached her contract when it offered the movie on streaming at the same time it played in theaters.
Disney said there was ""no merit"" to the lawsuit, saying it had complied with her contract. It added in a statement that the release of the movie on its streaming platform had ""significantly enhanced her (Johansson's) ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20 million she has received to date.”
Johansson's complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, argued that the dual release strategy of ""Black Widow"" had reduced her compensation, which was based partly on box office receipts from what was supposed to be an exclusive run in cinemas.
""Black Widow"" debuted on July 9 in theaters and for a $30 charge on the Disney+ streaming service. Disney has been testing the hybrid pattern for some films during the coronavirus pandemic as the company tried to boost its streaming service while many movie theaters around the world were closed.
Johansson's lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims that Disney wanted to steer audiences toward Disney+, ""where it could keep the revenues for itself while simultaneously growing the Disney+ subscriber base, a proven way to boost Disney's stock price.""
""Second, Disney wanted to substantially devalue Ms. Johansson’s agreement and thereby enrich itself,"" the lawsuit said.
The suit seeks unspecified damages to be determined at trial.
The outcome could have broad ramifications in Hollywood as media companies try to build their streaming services by offering premium programming to lure subscribers. 
The Disney statement said the lawsuit was ""especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.""
""Black Widow,"" the story of the Russian assassin turned Avenger, pulled in $80 million at U.S. and Canadian box offices over its debut weekend. The movie also generated $60 million through Disney+ purchases, Disney said.
Johansson has played the character in nine Marvel films.
Other movie studios including AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s Warner Bros. have negotiated payments to actors and others involved in films that were originally planned for theaters only but also offered on streaming during the pandemic.
Johansson's suit said her representatives approached Disney about resolving the issue but were ""largely ignored.""

The actress topped the Forbes magazine list of the world's highest-paid actress in 2018 and 2019. Johansson's pre-tax earnings totaled $56 million from June 2018 to June 2019.
Disney also is offering a same-day streaming release starting Friday for ""Jungle Cruise,"" an action-adventure movie starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt.

1224,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Ready for a summer lull?,"LONDON (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead from Karin Strohecker. 
We are almost at the end of a pretty breathless month: The peak growth versus peak inflation debate got a fresh lease of life thanks to Delta variant surges, a cooling of commodities' red-hot rally and of course, Beijing's big regulation crackdown.
Actually, those obstacles did little to keep equity markets from sailing to record highs across multiple regions on Thursday. Underpinning markets is a combo of robust earnings, a dovish Fed and data, such as U.S. GDP, which has been good enough to keep recovery hopes alive but good enough to hasten policy tightening talk.
Reassurances from Beijing's regulators and official media have also helped but not enough to make for a quiet Friday, with markets having a bit of a wobble. Chinese tech giants such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) have dropped about 10%, pushing the Hang Seng index some 2.5% lower.
U.S. futures paint a similar fate after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s lower-than-expected revenue doused Wall Street's enthusiasm. Nasdaq futures are down 1.5%.
European bourses are opening lower too but will today derail the market's attempt to notch a sixth straight month of gains? Hopefully now and with the STOXX 600 index up 2.5% in July, it would take some pretty major selling. 
It's a busy day for Europe's banks with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), UniCredit and BBVA (MC:BBVA) reporting. UniCredit is also holding exclusive talks with Italy's government over Monte dei Paschi, bringing Rome's favourite solution for the troubled Tuscan lender a step closer.
On currency markets, the dollar languishes near a one-month low and is set for its worst week since May after the Fed pulled the plug on a month-long rally. And government bonds across the world are their best monthly performances since at least March 2020.
Eurozone flash inflation numbers will garner attention after German data on Thursday showed inflation topping 3% and hitting 13-year highs. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday: 
-Japan's output, job availability jump but COVID curbs to slow growth
--German flash GDP Q2
-Euro zone flash HICP July/flash GDP/unemployment
-U.S. core PCE index/Chicago PMI/University of Michigan final index
-Auctions: U.S. 7-yr notes

The company now expects revenue for the full year to grow by a ""mid-single digit"" rate at constant currencies versus 2019 and its adjusted operating profit margin to be higher than in 2019.
EssilorLuxottica, which also makes sunglasses and spectacle frames for brands such as Chanel, Prada (OTC:PRDSY) and Versace, previously saw its full-year revenue and adjusted operating profit margin at least at the same level of 2019.
""On top of a buoyant U.S., generating more than 50% of the Group's revenue, other key markets were nicely growing and fuelling the company's business acceleration, namely France, Italy, UK, Mainland China, Australia and Brazil,"" the company said in a statement.
Revenue in the second quarter rose to 4.71 billion euros ($5.6 billion), up 103% compared with a year ago and 9.2% compared with 2019 at constant currencies.

Operating profit in the first half of the year reached 1.27 billion euros, compared with a loss of 378 million a year ago and up 35.1% versus 2019.

The unit’s core profit is now expected to hit the top end of its guidance range of $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion this year, Glencore said in a statement Friday. The outlook, an upgrade from a previous forecast for the top half of the range, would bring earnings from the trading business close to the record $3.3 billion it reported last year.
Commodities such as copper and aluminum surged in the first half of the year, fueled by trillions of dollars in government stimulus as the global economy looks to rebound from the pandemic. Thermal coal, a crucial commodity for Glencore, has also rallied strongly in recent months.
Rival traders such as Vitol Group and Trafigura Group have also made bumper profits, underscoring the lucrative opportunities seized by the biggest commodity traders as metal and energy markets were upended by the pandemic and the economic recovery efforts that followed.
At its mining operations, Glencore has been forced to lower some of its production goals for the year. Full-year Zinc, Nickeland coal output will be lower than previously expected.
The company also reported that it had produced 1,100 tons of Cobalt from its Mutanda copper and cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Glencore is processing metal stockpiles as it preparing to reopen the mine -- one of the biggest producers of battery metal cobalt, which was closed in late 2019 after prices crashed.
Glencore is scheduled to report first-half earnings next week.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), recently hit by the Archegos and Greensill scandals, has created a new role of chief risk officer for asset management that will be filled by Wolfram Peters, former chief risk officer at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, executives of the Swiss bank said in an internal memo seen by Reuters.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank has been overhauling risk and compliance since the two separate scandals hit its asset management and investment banking businesses in March, capping off a tumultuous two years for the lender.
The bank in April began overhauling its asset management setup and brought in former UBS executive Ulrich Koerner to lead the newly separated division, as it scrambles to return some $10 billion of client investments linked to insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital.
It has recovered some 66% of the funds' value, the bank said on Thursday, when it reported a nearly 80% slide in second-quarter net profit on the back of residual aftershocks related to the separate default of Archegos Capital Management.
Peters, who left Allianz in April according to LinkedIn, will begin his new role at Credit Suisse on Sept. 1. He previously spent 16 years in various risk roles at Allianz Global Investors, the asset management arm of German insurer Allianz. 
""Wolfram brings with him a proven track record of developing high-performing teams and designing and implementing a risk architecture that supported a transforming organization in the implementation of a rapidly developing business strategy,"" Koerner and interim group risk chief Joachim Oechslin told employees in a joint memo.
The contents of the memo were confirmed by a spokesperson for the bank.
Credit Suisse faces enforcement proceedings by the Swiss financial market supervisor over both the Greensill and Archegos matters, and launched internal investigations into the matters as well.

In a damning assessment of what went wrong, an independent review unveiled on Thursday repeatedly criticized the bank's risk management practices related to Archegos.
It has yet to unveil findings from its inquiry into Greensill.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Friday, weighed by more losses in Asia overnight and ahead of important growth data and more corporate earnings.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.6%.
European markets have received a negative handover from Asia, with the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong dropping around 2% as the tech sector resumed its selloff amid concerns over excessive Chinese government regulatory interference. 
The Hang Seng slumped more than 8% in two days of heavy selling early this week before bouncing back 3% in Thursday’s session.
Also weighing on sentiment Friday was a disappointing earnings report from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after the close on Wall Street Thursday. The e-commerce giant missed quarterly revenue expectations for the first time in three years while providing weak guidance for the current quarter.
Back in Europe, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) will be in the spotlight Friday after the French bank reported a 26% rise in net income in the second quarter and agreed to pay an additional dividend, helped by a rebound of domestic retail banking activity and a reduction in provisions for bad loans. U.K. bank NatWest Group (LON:NWG) also used its newly-regained freedom to pay a dividend, and announced a 750 million-pound buyback program.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) posted a half-year net profit, a sharp improvement from this time last year, and the French carmaker said it expected to post a full-year 2021 profit despite a worsening semiconductor chip shortage and rising raw materials costs.
Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) reported a jump in second-quarter revenue of 133% with its net loss narrowing, enabling it to predict a return to profitability in the current quarter as vaccination and an easing of travel restrictions improves bookings. 
In economic news, French gross domestic product rose 0.9% in the three months ending in June, an improvement from the drop of 0.1% the previous quarter despite a strict lockdown in April to contain a resurgence of Covid cases. 
This sets the scene for the equivalent data from Germany and the Eurozone as a whole later in the session, with growth expected to rebound as the region’s economies reopened after the pandemic.
Elsewhere, oil prices edged lower Friday, but are set to end the second consecutive week higher as investors remained confident about the global demand recovery.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $73.06 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.8% to $74.52, but both contracts are set for gains of around 2% for the week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,827.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1881.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp is set to report a boost to Vision Fund returns when it posts quarterly earnings due to the U.S. listing of Chinese portfolio firms, just as regulatory scrutiny of such firms clouds the outlook for the Japanese conglomerate.
The fund's listed portfolio swelled in April-June with initial public offerings (IPO) of ride-hailer Didi Global Inc, ""Uber (NYSE:UBER) for trucks"" firm Full Truck Alliance Co Ltd and edutech startup Zhangmen Education Inc.
However widespread regulatory action in China's technology and education sectors has spooked investors, wiping billions of dollars from the value of U.S.-listed Chinese firms.
Didi's shares fluctuated wildly on regulation-related media reports, whereas Tik-Tok owner Bytedance has postponed listing plans indefinitely, the Wall Street Journal reported this month.
""SoftBank has been touting Vision Fund's IPO flywheel and four of the last six listings have been Chinese but that will fade as the reality of China's crackdown sinks in,"" Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry wrote in a client note.
SoftBank is investing through its second Vision Fund, which has $40 billion in committed capital from SoftBank itself, making investments at earlier-than-usual stages as well as late-stage investments, such as in South Korean travel firm Yanolja.
The group reported a record $37 billion net profit in the financial year ended March due in large part to outsized gains from a stake in South Korean e-tailer Coupang Inc.
SoftBank's share price hit a two-decade high on the gain in March amid the group's largest-ever share buyback. The buyback is complete, and the price has fallen a third from that peak. 
""SBG has previously outlined its intention to address the overly high exposure of its investment portfolio to China, but we think rising global geopolitical tensions now look set to worsen investment returns sooner than expected,""  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Mitsunobu Tsuruo wrote in a note. 

SoftBank will likely book a first-quarter net loss of 175 billion yen ($1.60 billion) when it reports on Aug. 10, according to an average of two analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. The technology investor regards change in asset value rather than profit as the primary indicator of performance.

Huaibei Mining said in a filing on Wednesday that Evergrande's project company in the eastern province of Anhui repeatedly refused to pay the construction fee it owed Huaibei's unit, including commercial paper Evergrande issued to the unit, citing a lack of money, despite six requests for repayment. 
On Friday, Evergrande said in a stock exchange filing that parties are disputing over whether payment under the contract is due. It said its flagship unit, Evergrande Real Estate Group Co., has filed an objection to the court because it is not a party to the contract, so the litigation against it has no legal and contractual basis. 
Huaibei's construction unit signed a contract with Evergrande's project company in November 2018 and has completed the construction work, according to the filing, according to the mining company's filing, though it did not state the maturity date of the commercial paper. 
Commercial paper, which is not counted as interest-bearing debt, is commonly used in the property sector as a payable that promises construction suppliers a payment on a future fixed date, usually within one year.
Worries over the developer's debt and the potential systemic financial risk it posses have intensified after Evergrande admitted in June its project companies had not paid some commercial paper on time, but said it was arranging payment. Fitch downgraded its credit rating on Wednesday, signalling its concern of a potential default.[nL1N2P40Q8]

The developer is the biggest issuer of commercial paper in the country. Its flagship unit, Evergrande Real Estate Group, had 205.7 billion yuan ($32 billion) worth of commercial paper at the end of 2020, 24% higher than 2019 and 390% higher than 2015, filings showed.

The CSI 300 index fell 1%, led by consumer and health care shares, reversing Thursday’s gain. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng Index, which earlier this week saw its biggest two-day loss since 2008, dropped 0.8%.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. fell as much as 5.2% while Meituan lost 6.6%. Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. slid 3.7%.
Investors are now grappling with an uncertain regulatory landscape, given the range of industries targeted by the government. From derailing Ant Group’s blockbuster IPO at the eleventh hour to rules curbing monopolistic practices across the internet landscape, reducing leverage in the property industry and reforming the tutoring sector, the investor playbook continues to rapidly change.
“It’s the fear of the unknown,” said Justin Tang, head of Asia research at United First Partners. “Market sentiment is on thin ice. Investors probably expected more meat, however they only got bones in respect to details of the Chinese government’s exhortation to calm down.”
This week’s steep stock market declines were triggered by China’s move to ban swathes of its booming tutoring industry from making profits. It was the government’s most extreme step yet to rein in companies it blames for exacerbating inequality, increasing financial risk and challenging the Communist Party’s grip on key segments of the economy.
The ensuing rout was ferocious enough for Beijing to signal its discomfort. State-run media published a series of articles suggesting the selloff was overdone, while the nation’s securities regulator convened a video conference with banking executives Wednesday night to convey the message that education policies were not intended to hurt companies in other industries.
“Confidence has not fully recovered,” said Steven Leung, UOB Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd. executive director. “Investors need more explanation from regulators to clarify these policy uncertainties.”
The People’s Bank of China pumped a larger than usual amount of cash into the financial system for a second-straight day. The central bank injected 30 billion yuan ($4.6 billion) of short-term liquidity, after adding the same amount in the previous session. The move was made to soothe market nerves and ensure ample cash supply towards the end of the month, analysts say.
China’s CSI 300 Index is set to close about 8% lower for the month, which would be its worst performance since October 2018. The Hang Seng index is down by around 9% for the period.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) downgraded its China weighting to neutral from overweight in the broker’s model allocation for Asia excluding Japan. “We think regulatory pressure could continue for now,” analyst Manishi Raychaudhuri wrote in a note dated Thursday, adding that Chinese tech hardware, mobile gaming, electric vehicle-related stocks and new energy “could be relatively immune.”
The Hang Seng Tech Index fell by as much as 3.9%. Friday’s slide followed a decline by U.S.-listed Chinese stocks Thursday, as investors looked past gains by Didi Global Inc., amid reports the ride-hailing company was considering going private.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index -- which tracks 98 of China’s biggest firms listed in the U.S. -- fell by 0.5%, reversing some of Wednesday’s surge. Education stocks, the latest target of Beijing’s policy crackdowns, led the decline after two consecutive days of outsized gains.

(Reuters) - NASA on Thursday postponed a planned launch of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) CST-100 Starliner capsule to the International Space Station after the orbiting outpost was briefly thrown out of control by jet thrusters inadvertently activated on a newly docked Russian module, NASA said.
The Starliner launch delay was announced a day before it was due for blastoff from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop a Boeing  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) V rocket. NASA said the space agency and Boeing decided to push back the launch date to Aug. 3, with Aug. 4 set as an immediate backup.
""We wanted to make sure we had some breathing room to fully assess the situation on (the space) station before adding another vehicle to the ISS configuration,"" Kathy Lueders, an associate NASA administrator, told reporters during a conference call. The Atlas V rocket and Starliner capsule were being kept on the launch pad for the time being, NASA said.
A previous uncrewed Starliner test launch to orbit in 2019 ended with a nearly catastrophic failure of that spacecraft to dock with the space station.
The countdown to a do-over test flight was halted after difficulties arose with the newly arrived Russian laboratory module Nauka, which had docked with the orbiting space station a few hours earlier.
A few hours after Nauka had latched onto the space station, a number of its jet thrusters inadvertently began firing, causing the entire station to pitch out of its normal flight position in orbit, according to Joel Montalbano, manager of NASA's space station program.
""Loss of attitudinal control"" of the space station, with seven crew members aboard, lasted just over 45 minutes, until flight teams on the ground were able to restore the station's orientation with control thrusters, Montalbano told reporters.
He said at the height of the incident, the station was pitching out of alignment at the rate of about a half a degree per second. 
Communication with the crew - consisting of two Russian cosmonauts, three NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut and a French astronaut - was lost briefly twice during that interval, but ""there was no immediate danger at any time to the crew,"" Montalbano said.

What caused the thrusters of the Nauka module, delivered by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, to malfunction has yet to be determined, NASA officials said.
Montalbano added there was no immediate sign of any damage to the space station from the mishap. The loss of the space station's normal orientation was first detected by automatic sensors on the ground, and ""the crew really didn't feel any movement,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc on Thursday said sales growth would slow in the next few quarters as customers venture more outside the home, a tepid start to CEO Andy Jassy's reign after 27 years with Jeff Bezos at the retailer's helm.
Spending growth by Prime members, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s most valuable customers, has eased as well, the company said. Shares fell 7% in after-hours trade.
More than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon's financial luster is fading slightly. When brick-and-mortar stores closed, Amazon posted record profits, drew more than 200 million Prime loyalty subscribers, and recruited over 500,000 workers to keep up with surging demand.
Now, the company is facing the tough task of climbing higher still. While revenue surged 44% in the first quarter of this year, that figure dropped to 27% for the period ended June 30. Sales may only rise as much as 16% in the third quarter, Amazon said.
Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, attributed this to a difficult comparison to last year, when consumers stayed more indoors and relied on e-commerce for their everyday needs. In the United States and Europe, customers are now out and about.
They are ""doing other things besides shopping,"" he said.
Revenue was $113 billion for the second quarter, shy of analysts' average estimate of $115 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Profit rose 48% to $7.8 billion, the second-largest Amazon ever announced.
Amazon expects this lower growth to continue for the next few quarters, Olsavsky told reporters.
The outlook comes just after Jassy on July 5 inherited Amazon's top job, which has never been bigger or more complex. Last quarter Amazon announced a deal to buy the film studio MGM for $8.5 billion, expanding in Hollywood at the same time as it is running a grocery chain, building a healthcare business and facing scrutiny from regulators worldwide.
Olsavsky said the company hopes COVID-19 will subside and that the economy will continue to bounce back. While peers Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said they will require vaccines for workers returning to offices, Amazon has made no such announcement.
The company in the pandemic has grappled with staff protests over safety precautions and a high-profile, failed unionization bid in a facility in Bessemer, Alabama. 
Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones, said it was ""not feasible"" for Amazon to maintain its breakneck pace.
""It's still phenomenal growth when you think of the sheer size of the business,"" he said. ""Obviously the pandemic helped them, but they're not going to be able to grow that rapidly on top of those numbers.""
LABOR SHORTAGE
The world's biggest online retailer had moved its annual marketing blitz, Prime Day, to June, hoping to peddle goods before shoppers headed out on vacation. This only helped so much: Sales since May 15 have been up just in the mid-teens excluding Prime Day, Olsavsky told analysts.
Amazon Web Services has fared better. The cloud computing division that Jassy long ran grew revenue 37% to $14.8 billion, ahead of estimates of more than $14.1 billion. Though AWS has lowered prices, it has signed new multi-year agreements with large customers, Olsavsky said.
Enormous challenges have come with Amazon's size.
Costs continue to rise, aside from the $200 million in extra stock Amazon plans to pay Jassy over the next 10 years. The company has offered an average $17 in hourly wages plus signing bonuses to attract 75,000 workers during a labor shortage.
Olsavsky said he expects wage pressure to stay for the near future, as industry reopenings, government payments and back-to-school impact individuals' willingness to work.
""It's a very competitive labor market out there, and certainly the biggest contributor to inflationary pressures that we're seeing in the business,"" he said.
The No.2 U.S. employer this winter became a rallying point for organized labor, which wanted to form Amazon's first U.S. union and inspire similar efforts across the country. Amazon is awaiting a decision on whether a U.S. National Labor Relations Board regional director will overturn its landslide victory in the Bessemer, Alabama union election and call for a rerun.
Following the April vote count, Bezos said he aimed to make Amazon a better place to work. It is unclear how he will govern from the sidelines in the role of executive chair of Amazon's board.

Olsavsky said Jassy has ""hit the ground running,"" though Bezos would continue to weigh in on decisions where there was no turning back.
""We've had a good handoff,"" Olsavsky said. But Bezos ""will not be leaving. He's obviously continuing to be very involved.""

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 09:18PM ET</span>",Robinhood closes at $34.82 in grim stock market debut,"By Echo Wang and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) -Robinhood Markets Inc's shares closed more than 8% lower at $34.82 per share on their first day of trading, as many investors who used the popular trading app to participate in this year's ""meme"" stock trading frenzy snubbed its initial public offering (IPO)
Only 16 of the 99 U.S.-listed companies that were worth at least $10 billion when they went public declined on their first day, according to Dealogic, whose data goes back to 1995.

“A year ago we were trading the stock at 15 bucks a share. And our most recent trades in early June were $55 a share (in the private market),” said Glen Anderson, president of Rainmaker Securities, a secondary trading platform for private pre-IPO shares. Anderson said they traded about $200 million in Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) stocks in the private market last year.
Robinhood's easy-to-use interface has made it a hit among young investors trading from home on cryptocurrencies and stocks such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some IPO investors stayed on the sidelines, citing concerns over its frothy valuation, the risk of regulators cracking down on Robinhood's business, and lingering anger with the company's imposition of trading curbs when the meme stock trading frenzy flared in January. In an unusual move, Robinhood had said it would reserve between 20% and 35% of its shares for its users. Many IPOs benefit from excluding retail investors, who end up fueling a first-day trading pop by snapping up shares in the open market. By letting many retail investors under the IPO tent, Robinhood made big gains less likely for investors on the first day.""The market believes that institutional investors will hold on for a longer time, and retail investors are more likely to flip,"" said Reena Aggarwal, professor of finance at Georgetown University. Robinhood shares priced at $38 in the IPO. Stanford University roommates Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt founded the company in 2013. The two will hold a majority of the voting power, with Bhatt keeping around 39% of the outstanding stock and Tenev about 26.2%. ""It maybe seemed like a good idea to offer (the IPO) to your customers, but it might not be very helpful when it comes to controlling how the shares are allocated and the beginning of the trading of this IPO,"" said Kathleen Smith at Renaissance Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. Robinhood enraged some investors and U.S. lawmakers this year when it restricted trading in some popular stocks following a 10-fold rise in deposit requirements at its clearinghouse. It has been at the center of many regulatory probes. The company disclosed this week that it has received inquiries from U.S. regulators looking into whether its employees traded shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings, Inc before the trading curbs were placed at the end of January.

Kansas City shareholders should reject Canadian National's $33.6 billion bid as there are regulatory risks involved, Canadian Pacific said in a regulatory filing, adding that the proposed acquisition can be decided later.
The terms of Canadian National's deal would bind Kansas City shareholders with the merger agreement until next year, ""instead of being free to pursue other opportunities that may be in the best interests of KCS stockholders,"" Canadian Pacific Railway said.
Canadian Pacific and larger rival Canadian National were in the race to take over the U.S. railroad operator that would create the first direct railway linking Canada, the United States, and Mexico. 
In May, Kansas City accepted Canadian National's acquisition offer, upending a prior $29 billion deal with Canadian Pacific.

Kansas City and Canadian National did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment outside regular business hours. 
In May, the U.S. Department of Justice said Canadian National's bid for Kansas City appears to pose greater risks to competition.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Thursday, boosted by robust U.S. earnings and forecasts, while data showed the economy recovered to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter.
The U.S. economy grew solidly in the second quarter, putting the level of gross domestic product above its pre-pandemic peak, but the pace of GDP growth was slower than economists had expected.
Among the latest upbeat earnings news, shares of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co jumped 3.8% as the company lifted its profit forecast for the year, while KFC owner Yum Brands Inc rose 6.3% after it beat expectations for quarterly sales.
The day's lower than expected economic data may have calmed a bit of investor angst that the Federal Reserve's ""easy money policy"" may be going away soon, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. Investors also saw ""some pretty good earnings today,"" he said.
Stocks got a boost on Wednesday after the Fed said it was not yet time to start withdrawing its massive monetary stimulus.
Economically sensitive groups including financials, materials and energy led S&P sector gains on Thursday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 153.6 points, or 0.44%, to 35,084.53, the S&P 500 gained 18.51 points, or 0.42%, to 4,419.15 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.68 points, or 0.11%, to 14,778.26.
The Dow and S&P 500 hit intraday record highs early in the session.
The S&P 500 real estate sector hit a record intraday high as well, but ended down 0.2%.
On the down side,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) shares fell 4% as the company warned revenue growth would ""decelerate significantly"" following Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s recent update to its iOS operating system that would impact the social media giant's ability to target ads. 
Graphic: U.S. stock market's rising valuation - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdpzyrnwjvw/Pasted%20image%201627570968776.png 
Results were in from about half of the S&P 500 companies as of Thursday morning. Nearly 91% of the reports have beaten profit estimates, and second-quarter earnings now are expected to have jumped 87.2% from a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.
After the bell, shares of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) were down more than 5% after the company reported results and forecast third-quarter sales below Wall Street expectations.
During the regular session, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc jumped 4.7% and was the biggest boost to the S&P 500, followed by Apple, which rose after Wednesday's declines.
Also, shares of  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD), the popular trading app used by many investors to participate in this year's ""meme"" stock trading frenzy, ended down 8.4% on their first day of trading.
With rising inflation and concerns that higher prices would not be as transient as expected, focus on Friday will be on the June reading of the personal consumption expenditures price index.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.13 billion shares, compared with the average of about 9.86 billion for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.34-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 76 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 105 new highs and 49 new lows.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 07:16PM ET</span>","Less social media, more socializing hits Pinterest as U.S. user growth slows","By Tiyashi Datta
(Reuters) - Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc on Thursday said user growth in the United States was decelerating as people who used the platform for crafts and DIY projects during the height of the pandemic are stepping out more as curbs ease.
Shares of the digital pinboard site slumped nearly 20% in extended trade, with investors looking past Pinterest beating revenue estimates in the second quarter, as overall monthly active users (MAUs) fell short of expectations.
Social media companies worldwide saw digital ad spending and user growth surge as lockdowns accelerated the shift to e-commerce, but analysts are now concerned if those gains are here to stay. 
""Pinterest's use case was very compelling for people staying at home during the pandemic, and with the economy opening up, there is less focus on what Pinterest is best for,"" Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian said. 
Overall MAUs, a widely watched metric, rose by only 9% to 454 million during the quarter. Analysts had estimated 487.1 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data. It had risen 30% in the prior quarter. 
""For the past year, we've highlighted how people came to Pinterest for inspiration to reinvent their lives during such a difficult time. Now as the world opens up, we're seeing the similar effect in the opposite direction,"" Chief Executive Officer Ben Silbermann said during a call with analysts. 
Pinterest's MAUs in the United States, a major market for the company, was nearly 7% lower as of July 27. Its global MAUs grew by about 5%. 

The shift in user engagement was more visible in web than mobile app users, Pinterest said, adding that web users tended to be, on average, less engaged and generated lower revenue. 
Total revenue more than doubled to $613 million in the quarter versus analysts' average estimates of $562.1 million.

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 06:46PM ET</span>",Canada's spectrum auction raises record $7.2 billion as firms gear for high-speed internet,"By David Ljunggren and Moira Warburton
OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's auction of 3500 MHz spectrum, which is key for next generation 5G networks, generated a record C$8.9 billion ($7.2 billion), with the country's three dominant telecom companies accounting for more than 80% of the amount raised.
Out of 1,504 available licenses, 1,495 were awarded to 15 Canadian companies, including 757 licenses to small and regional providers, Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said in a statement on Thursday.
The results would boost competition, he added, a reference to Ottawa's push to open up a market dominated by BCE (NYSE:BCE) Inc, Telus (NYSE:TU) Corp and Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Communications Inc, known as the big three. 
Canadian consumers have complained of steep wireless bills, which are among the highest in the world, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government has asked operators to cut prices by a quarter by 2021.
Preliminary results showed that  BCE Inc  spent C$2.1 billion, Rogers C$3.3 billion and Telus Corp C$1.9 billion.
The 3500 MHz range airwaves are key to provide 5G wireless services as they carry larger volumes of data over long distances. They also offer faster upload and download speeds and help power everything from smart cities to driverless cars.
Vidéotron, owned by Quebecor Inc, spent C$830 million to expand its geographic footprint in Canada, buying licenses not just in its native Quebec but also in Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia.
The move indicates that Quebecor plans to become a service provider in those areas, said Mark Goldberg, an industry analyst. He noted that the areas where the company did not bid - Saskatchewan and Atlantic Canada - both have preexisting strong fourth competitors to the big three.
""They're prepared to be the fourth service provider... This is showing pretty close to a billion dollars in investment in spectrum,"" Goldberg said.
Vidéotron said in a statement that the investment would help the company to ""realize its ambition of boosting healthy competition in telecom beyond the borders of Québec.""
Bell, Rogers and Telus said their investments will help to provide reliable 5G services.

The auction, initially set to take place in June 2020 and delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, closed after eight days and 103 rounds of bidding, the government said.

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 06:46PM ET</span>",U.S. senators upbeat on prospects for bipartisan infrastructure bill - for now,"By Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Thursday prepared to tackle the details of a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill backed by President Joe Biden, with the possibility of weekend work looming after lawmakers agreed to advance the measure.
Another vote was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EDT (1530 GMT) on Friday to begin debate on the proposal to rebuild America's roads, ports and bridges, beginning a process that could last for days and could include amendments that change the bill or cloud its chances of passage.
Both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, were upbeat about the road ahead on the bill, which was brokered by Senate negotiators and White House officials and cleared an important procedural hurdle by a vote of 67-32 on Wednesday.
""It took some prodding and a few deadlines, but it has all worked out for the better,"" Schumer said on Thursday on the Senate floor.
McConnell, who was among 17 Republicans who voted to advance the measure, called it a ""focused compromise"" and an ""important, basic duty of government.""
""I’m glad to see these discussions making progress and I was happy to vote to begin moving the Senate toward what ought to be a robust, bipartisan floor process for legislation of this magnitude,"" McConnell said.
Some amendments are expected to be proposed, including on the bill's broadband internet provisions, the Senate's number two Republican, John Thune, said, without giving details. 
Thune told reporters that he thought some Republicans who voted to advance the measure had not yet committed to supporting the final product.
""A lot of that will depend on scores,"" or cost estimates of the bill, to be produced by the Congressional Budget Office, he said. The CBO has not said when it will release the estimate, but it could be delayed until there is a full text of the bill.
But Senator Kevin Cramer, a conservative Republican, said CBO had already scored parts of the bill, and their findings, which broadly backed the lawmakers' estimates, were discussed at a Republican lunch Wednesday before the vote. ""I think that that was a very important thing for a lot of Republicans that were skeptical going in,"" Cramer said. 
The bipartisan measure is a key component of Biden's larger domestic policy agenda. After it is passed, Democratic leaders plan to move ahead with a sweeping $3.5 trillion budget ""reconciliation"" package that is expected to include climate and social spending. Republicans have vowed to oppose that effort.
Schumer said on Thursday his goal remains to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the budget resolution before senators take their summer break, which was supposed to start in the second week of August.
Senator Rob Portman, the lead Republican negotiator on the bipartisan infrastructure plan, said he didn't expect any amendments that would, if adopted, actually threaten passage.
""I haven't heard of any amendments that would be poison pills. So I think people are interested in getting to yes here, even if they didn't vote for the bill tonight,"" Portman told reporters after Wednesday's vote.
Portman said he hoped there would be plenty of time allowed for amendments so members' concerns are heard. ""We want to get a strong vote because we need to send it over to the House, like a torpedo, with plenty of bipartisan support,"" he said.

The bill must also pass the House of Representatives, where Democrats have a thin majority. Some senior Democrats there, including Representative Peter DeFazio, chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, have expressed concern that the bill lacks sufficient climate measures.
""If they send it over here in early August it will sit. It will sit for a very long time, which would give us a chance to engage the experts"" before taking action, DeFazio told reporters.

1244,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 06:35PM ET</span>",Emergent to resume J&J COVID-19 vaccine production at Baltimore plant,"(Reuters) -Emergent BioSolutions said it will resume production of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine at its troubled Baltimore facility, where operations were stopped in April after millions of doses were found to be contaminated.
The development was announced late on Wednesday. Last week, J&J slashed 2021 production target of its single-dose vaccine to between 500 million and 600 million doses from its original goal to produce a billion shots.
The resumption follows additional reviews and collaboration with the FDA and manufacturing partners, Emergent Chief Executive Officer Robert Kramer said.
The FDA has so far approved five batches from the Emergent facility since production there was paused, and J&J is working to clear additional doses for use, the drugmaker said last week.
Emergent expects the FDA to approve additional batches of J&J shots, Kramer said during Emergent's Thursday investor call. 
U.S. health regulators in April halted operations at the Baltimore plant following a discovery that ingredients from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine, also being produced there at that time, contaminated a batch of J&J's vaccines.
That month, the U.S. government asked Emergent to stop making AstraZeneca shots after it discovered the cross contamination.
""We continue to work collaboratively with AstraZeneca to complete all documents related to their drug substance so they and the U.S. government can make decisions regarding the disposition of this material,"" Kramer said during the call. 
An FDA inspection also turned up a long list of sanitary problems and bad manufacturing practices.
J&J's vaccine, considered more convenient for use, storing and shipping to remote areas, has seen a relatively slow uptake in Europe and the United States due to safety concerns and the production issues.
""We will continue to work toward securing Emergency Use Authorization in the United States for drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview as quickly as possible,"" J&J said in an email.
The FDA did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, cited a letter from the FDA saying the agency had no objections with the plant resuming manufacturing. (https://on.wsj.com/3iXSAfg)

The facility could make as many as 120 million doses a month at full capacity, but the finished doses might not be available until this fall, the Journal reported.
Emergent expects to launch in the near future a late stage study for a COVID-19 therapeutic it is developing in partnership with the U.S. government, executives said on the investor call.

(Reuters) -Gilead Sciences Inc on Thursday posted a higher-than-expected second-quarter profit, helped by strong demand for its COVID-19 antiviral treatment, Veklury, but sales of its flagship HIV drugs lagged as the pandemic continued to limit visits to doctors.
Sales of HIV medicines, which have stalled during the coronavirus pandemic, fell 2% to $3.9 billion.
Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) Chief Commercial Officer Johanna Mercier on a conference call with analysts said HIV sales in Europe have begun to recover, but U.S. demand has been slower. ""It is clear that it will take several quarters for treatment to return to pre-pandemic levels,"" she said.
Gilead shares, which closed at $69.83, were down more than 2% in extended trading.
Gilead reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.87 per share, beating Wall Street expectations by 12 cents.
The biotechnology company's total revenue for the quarter rose 21% from a year earlier to $6.2 billion, slightly higher than the average analyst estimate of $6.07 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The results were ""driven by in-line performance of their core products and strength in Veklury, demonstrating the ability of their portfolio mix to hedge against any COVID-related headwinds. Oncology and hepatitis C businesses were encouragingly solid,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note.
Sales of Veklury, known chemically as remdesivir, totaled $829 million for the quarter, easily topping Wall Street estimates of $675 million.
Gilead said Veklury sales would continue to be subject to uncertainty since they are tightly linked to COVID-19 hospitalization rates. The company also said it was no longer pursuing development of an inhaled version of the drug for COVID-19.
Chief Executive Daniel O'Day said Veklury, given intravenously to hospitalized patients, is effective against all known variants of the coronavirus, adding that the company continues to develop other pipeline products for treating COVID-19 outside of a hospital setting.
Sales of Gilead's hepatitis C drugs bounced back in the quarter, rising 23% to $549 million.

For full-year 2021, Gilead narrowed its forecast for adjusted earnings per share to $6.90 to $7.25 from its prior projection of $6.75 to $7.45.
The company said it now expects product sales for the year of $24.4 billion to $25 billion, compared with a previous estimate of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion.

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 05:36PM ET</span>",U.S. charges Nikola founder Trevor Milton with lying to investors,"By Jonathan Stempel and Ben Klayman
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Trevor Milton, the billionaire founder and former chief executive of Nikola Corp, was criminally charged on Thursday with defrauding investors by lying to them about the electric- and hydrogen-powered truck maker.
Milton, 39, pleaded not guilty at a hearing in Manhattan federal court to two counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud over statements he made from November 2019 to September 2020 about Nikola's products and technology.
Authorities said Milton relied on a public relations blitz of social media posts as well as TV and podcast interviews to drive up Nikola's stock price, become one of the world's 100 richest people and ""elevate"" his stature as an entrepreneur.
""Milton lied about nearly every aspect of the business,"" U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan said at a news conference. ""Today's criminal charges against Milton are where the rubber meets the road.""
A judge allowed Milton to go free on $100 million bond, partially secured by two homes that the Oakley, Utah, resident owns.
Each criminal count carries a maximum prison term of 20 or 25 years. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges.
""Trevor is innocent,"" Milton's lawyer Marc Mukasey said in an email. ""There was no fraud. We're ready to fight this case at trial.""
Nikola was not charged. It said in a statement it cooperated with the government and is focused on delivering Tre battery-electric trucks this year.
In afternoon trading, Nikola shares were down $1.43, or 10.1%, to $12.76, after falling as low as $12.60.
WARY OF SHORT-SELLERS
The charges mark a steep downfall for Milton, who founded Phoenix-based Nikola in 2014 and was its CEO until June 2020, when it went public after merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. 
Milton stepped down as Nikola's executive chairman last September, two weeks after short-seller Hindenburg Research labeled the company a ""fraud"" and said it made many misleading statements about its technology.
Prosecutors said Milton's improper statements included that Nikola had built an electric- and hydrogen-powered ""Badger"" pickup from the ""ground up,"" developed batteries in-house that he knew it was purchasing elsewhere, and had early success in creating a ""Nikola One"" semi-truck he knew did not work.
Strauss said the closest the Nikola One ever came to driving was when company engineers rolled a prototype down a hill so it could be filmed for a commercial.
The indictment said Milton also became preoccupied with keeping Nikola's stock price high.
It said that on March 2, 2020, the day before Nikola revealed it would go public, Milton emailed a board member that ""(we) need to make sure we are getting retail investors on our side. That is what prevents the stock short selling. This is super important to me.""
The SEC said Milton targeted ordinary investors he called ""Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) investors,"" portraying himself as a ""different"" type of CEO who would be forthright about his trailblazing company.
""Corporate officers cannot say whatever they want on social media without regard for the federal securities laws,"" SEC enforcement chief Gurbir Grewal said at the news conference.
Prosecutors said Milton's Nikola stake was worth at least $8.5 billion soon after the announcements regarding the Badger. 
Although Nikola's share price has fallen more than 85% from its June 2020 peak, Milton is still worth $1.2 billion, Forbes magazine said on Thursday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is among Nikola's rivals in the electric truck sector.
Both companies' names derive from Nikola Tesla, an inventor whose work included electric power, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is now among the world's richest people.
In 2018, Musk and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million in civil fines to settle SEC charges over a Musk tweet.
ACCOUNTABILITY
Nikola initially denied Hindenburg's accusations, but in February said a review by an outside law firm uncovered statements by Milton and the company that were partially or completely wrong.
""We commend regulators for acting expediently to protect investors and hold Milton accountable for his egregious lies,"" Hindenburg founder Nathan Anderson said in a statement.
Hindenburg issued its report two days after General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) agreed to supply batteries, chassis architecture, fuel cell systems and a factory for the Badger pickup, in exchange for an 11% Nikola stake and $700 million.
The companies reworked that relationship last November, eliminating the equity stake and plans to build the truck.
Stephen Girsky, a former GM vice chairman who ran the SPAC that merged with Nikola, replaced Milton as Nikola's chairman.
SPACs are a faster way than initial public offerings to take private companies public.

But critics say the process is prone to conflicts of interest and shoddy due diligence, and U.S. authorities have stepped up their scrutiny of SPACs.
Prosecutors and the SEC are also investigating electric pickup truck maker Lordstown Motors Corp, which went public last October, about the terms of its SPAC and its statements about vehicle pre-orders.

Buy These 4 Safe Consumer Staples Stocks,"Consumer staples companies are regarded as safe investment bets during times of market volatility owing to the relatively stable demand for their products. So, given the expected market correction, and/or continuing volatility, we think consumer staples companies PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Costco (COST),  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO), and Sysco (SYY) could be wise bets now. Read on.The stock market is expected to see a correction soon due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States with the rapid spread of the Delta variant. However, many analysts expect a market correction of 10% to 15% will represent a “significant opportunity” to invest in quality stocks.
Amid the volatility concerns, consumer staples stocks could be good bets considering the inelastic demand for their companies’ products. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Sector Index has gained 14.1% over the past year and 5.4% year-to-date. Companies operating in consumer staples should grow substantially amid the potential market slowdown because consumers tend to panic and purchase such items in bulk quantities.
Given this backdrop, we think leading consumer staples stocks PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Altria Group, Inc. (MO), and Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) should be good additions to one’s portfolio.

It’s been an exciting couple of months for the Nasdaq Composite as the index has continued its relentless rally off its May lows, up 16% in barely 50 trading days. While the relentless bid under the market has been great for those fully invested in some of the best growth names, this rally has pushed valuations back to unreasonable levels over the short run, with quite a few stocks trading at more than 45x sales. This has made it quite difficult to find stocks available for new purchases, with investors taking on heightened risk by starting new positions at current levels. Fortunately, while most of the market remains expensive, there are a few names still trading at reasonable valuations that have either been out of favor short-term or out of favor for most of 2021. In this update, we’ll look at two of these names below:

As such, we believe Pizza delivery stocks Papa John's (PZZA) and Domino's (DPZ) are likely to benefit from the industry tailwinds. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA), which is based in Louisville, Ky., operates and franchises pizza restaurants and provides delivery services internationally.

Over the past year, restaurants have rearranged their businesses, focusing, notably, on their delivery networks to remain operational amid pandemic-driven lockdowns. However, as the economy revives, and with significant progress on the vaccination front, the demand for dining in restaurants is rebounding. The National Restaurant Association forecasts a 10.7% rise in sales for full-service establishments and an 8% increase in sales for limited-service restaurants in 2021. The forecast bodes well for both DPZ and PZZA.

1253,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 04:40PM ET</span>",UniCredit in talks with Italy to buy Monte dei Paschi,"By Valentina Za and Giuseppe Fonte
MILAN (Reuters) -UniCredit said on Thursday it would hold exclusive talks with Italy's government over Monte dei Paschi, a move that could see the Tuscan lender return to private ownership four years after it was rescued by the state. 
Rome has long singled out UniCredit as the best buyer for Monte dei Paschi (MPS) which needs another 2.5 billion euros in capital after the 2017 bailout that cost Italian taxpayers 5.4 billion euros. 
Legal risks following decades of mismanagement, poor loan quality and a weakened commercial franchise have made MPS a tough sell, forcing the Treasury to work hard to line up sufficient incentives for a buyer.
Banking stress test results on Friday are expected to highlight MPS' fragility.
UniCredit Chief Executive Andrea Orcel, who took over in April, said the bank had signed a termsheet with the Treasury detailing the conditions at which it could buy ""selected parts"" of MPS.
""This is just the start of a due diligence ... we have not negotiated the transaction ... all we have is some guidelines so that we have an alignment between the two parties on what we're trying to achieve,"" he told a conference call.
However, a person involved in the negotiations said the Treasury was confident it would reach an accord after the summer and had a draft deal already in place.
Orcel said talks would last a few weeks and a decision could emerge sometime in September. 
UniCredit said the conditions set for a deal meant that there would be no impact on its core capital. Also, it would not take on any impaired loan of MPS and be allowed to offload also MPS' performing loans that appear risky. 
The source close to the deal said state-owned bad loan manager AMCO would take on MPS' problem loans.
UniCredit would also be shielded from any actual and potential risks stemming from MPS' pending lawsuits. The source said such risks would be spun off from the bank and be kept in state hands.
The conditions for an accord mean the acquisition would bring a double-digit boost to UniCredit's earnings per share as well as improve its price to tangible book value ratio, Orcel said.
A potential deal would ""strengthen our competitive position in Italy and allow us to generate material synergies,"" he said.
Orcel, a veteran dealmaker and former UBS chief of investment banking, had so far shown little appetite for a deal, saying he was focused on an internal overhaul at UniCredit and a business plan the bank is due to present in the autumn.
""I have been clear on the role that M&A can play, it is not a goal per se, it can be an accelerator,"" he said. 

Reuters reported on July 21 that the government was working on making MPS attractive to UniCredit despite Orcel's public reticence.
UniCredit reports first-half results on Friday.

The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that the Chinese company has been mulling delisting plans as a crackdown in China widens and it has received support from cybersecurity regulators.
Didi, which listed in New York last month after raising $4.4 billion in an initial public offering (IPO), said in a statement that the WSJ report was not true.
""The company affirms that the above information is not true,"" it said, in reference to the report. ""The company is fully cooperating with the relevant government authorities in China in the cybersecurity review of the company.""
Shares in Didi jumped as much as 40% in premarket trade on news of the WSJ report, but pared gains when trading opened on Wall Street. Didi rose 11.2% from Wednesday to close at $9.86 a share, but is down 29.6% from its listing price on June 30.
Days after Didi's market debut, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) launched an investigation into the company and asked it to stop registering new users, citing national security and the public interest.
The regulator also said it would remove the mobile apps operated by Didi from app stores.
Didi's listing was the biggest stock sale by a Chinese company since the 2014 listing of e-commerce behemoth  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
The action against Didi came close on the heels of a month-long regulatory crackdown on China's massive internet sector for antitrust, customer data privacy and other violations, which has rattled investors.
Beijing said earlier this month that officials from at least seven departments, including the CAC, Ministry of Transport, and State Administration for Market Regulation (SMAR) were conducting an on-site cybersecurity review of Didi.
The CAC had been looking into whether there is a possibility of some of the company's data ending up in the hands of a foreign entity given Beijing's sensitivity about usage of onshore data, sources have told Reuters.
Didi has been in talks with bankers, regulators and key investors to try to resolve the problems following its listing on the New York Stock Exchange, the WSJ report said. (https://on.wsj.com/3ybFu4h)
The WSJ reported that Didi had asked its major underwriters to assess investors' views regarding a privatisation plan, as well as the pricing range that they would accept.
A take-private deal that would involve a tender offer for its publicly traded shares is one of the preliminary options being considered, the WSJ report said. 
Chinese companies have been under increasing U.S. scrutiny. 

A commissioner with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday that U.S.-listed Chinese companies must disclose the risks of Chinese government interference in their business as part of their regular reporting obligations.
The SEC in March adopted measures that would kick foreign companies off American stock exchanges if they do not comply with U.S. auditing standards. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has long complained about its lack of access in China.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. shares bounded to record highs on Thursday helped by strong company earnings and solid economic growth data, though the Federal Reserve's message earlier this week that it is in no hurry to taper stimulus pinned the dollar at a one-month low.
Following a spate of strong corporate earnings reports from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co to KFC owner Yum Brands Inc overnight, investors were further cheered by data showing the U.S. economy grew at a solid annualized pace of 6.5% in the second quarter.

The market exuberance did not extend to the dollar, which languished as investors digested the Federal Reserve's remarks on Wednesday that the strength of future economic data will determine when it starts to taper its bond purchases.
The dollar index fell 0.38% to 91.898, a level last seen on June 29. A sluggish dollar hoisted the euro up 0.35% to $1.1887, its highest in more than three weeks. [USD/]
Treasury yields seesawed in choppy trade, as investors grappled with the conflicting signals of the Fed's dovish tone and the run of positive economic and corporate news.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 04:36PM ET</span>",Biden wants U.S automakers to pledge 40% electric vehicles by 2030 -sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House has told U.S. automakers it wants them to back a voluntary pledge of at least 40% of new vehicles sales being electric by 2030 as it works to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, sources briefed on the matter said.
The administration is set as early as next week to roll out proposed revisions to vehicle emissions standards through 2026. Sources said a voluntary electric vehicle (EV) target could be as high as 50% but emphasized that no agreement with automakers has been reached and many details remain under discussion, including whether that pledge will include various types of gasoline-electric hybrids.
United Auto Workers spokesman (UAW) Brian Rothenberg said a published report was inaccurate ""that we have agreed to 40% EVs by 2030. The UAW is still in discussions and has not reached agreement at this point."" The UAW has opposed EV mandates, warning it could put some jobs at risk.
This month, Stellantis, parent company of Fiat Chrysler, said it was targeting over 40% of U.S. vehicles be low emission by 2030. Stellantis declined to comment on Thursday.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) declined to comment on the talks. It has said it aspires to end sales of new U.S. gasoline-powered light duty vehicles by 2035. The White House declined to comment on the discussions.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co did not comment on the discussions but noted it has said it plans ""at least 40% of our global vehicle volume being all-electric by 2030.""
The Biden administration has resisted calls from many Democrats to set a binding target for EV adoption or to follow California in setting 2035 as a date to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered light duty vehicles.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are reviewing former President Donald Trump's March 2020 rollback of fuel economy standards. Trump required 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026, well below the 5% yearly boosts set in 2012 by President Barack Obama's administration.
Biden's proposed rules, which would cover 2023-2026, are expected to be similar in overall vehicle emissions reductions to California's 2019 deal with some automakers that aims to improve fuel economy 3.7% annually, sources told Reuters. The 2026 requirements are expected to exceed the Obama-era 5% annual improvements.
In March, a group of 71 Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives urged Biden to set tough emissions rules to ensure that 60% of new passenger cars and trucks sold are zero-emission by 2030.

The United States pledged at a global climate summit this year to reduce emissions 50% to 52% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.
In April, a dozen governors from states including California, New York and Massachusetts, urged Biden to endorse banning new passenger gasoline-powered vehicle sales by 2035.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed near record highs Thursday, led by gains in cyclical stocks as investors looked through softer second-quarter U.S. growth amid signs of stronger consumer spending. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.43% to remain close to its closing record of 4,422.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, or 175 points, ending the day just below its closing record of 35,144.91. The Nasdaq was up 0.1%.
Real gross domestic product grew at 6.5% annual rate in the second quarter, missing expectations for nearly 8.5% growth. But, a deeper look at the components of the growth gave plenty of reason for optimism as consumer spending topped expectations.
“The data was disappointing […] but the details were quite constructive,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. “Consumption was stronger than expected, rising by 11.8% annualized, and so was business investment, which rose 8%.”
The upside surprise in consumer spending offset weekly jobless claims data, supporting the economically-linked cyclical stocks including energy, materials and financials.
Energy was leading to the upside as oil prices climbed amid a fall in the dollar, though rising Covid-19 cases continue to muddy the outlook for energy demand.  
Financials were boosted by jump in regional banking stocks even as Treasury yields retreated from the highs of the session. 
Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF) was up more than 3% after reporting better-than-expected earnings.
Lower interest rates hurt the return on interest that banks earn from their loan products, or net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
In technology, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was down 4% after the social media giant warned that Apple’s privacy policies tweaks will weigh on advertising revenue.
“Management expects to see a significant slow down in y/y growth, and a moderate sequential decline in the two-year growth rates in 2H which is above our previous estimates but essentially in line with the current consensus, and a forecast less positive than peers, in our view. The forecast is partially being driven by headwinds from Apple's ATT starting to have an impact,” Wedbush said in a note.
Other megacap tech stocks traded mixed. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), were higher, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ended the day in the red.
A rise in chip stocks also supported the broader tech sector, led by gains in the Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) rose 6% after reporting quarterly results that topped analysts estimates, and the chipmaker delivered a positive outlook ahead amid expectations for easing supply chain woes.
The gains in the broader market come just a day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank tapering goal would need more time to assess the progress the economy has made toward the threshold to begin tapering bond purchases. 
In other news,  Robinhood Markets  (NASDAQ:HOOD) closed 8% lower at $34.82 per share on its trading debut, below its initial public offering price of $38 a share.

Investing.com -- Stocks stretched into record territory on Thursday, a familiar theme to investors a day after the Federal Reserve assured the markets it wasn’t about to let its foot off the economic gas pedal anytime soon.
On Thursday, data on real gross domestic product showed the economy grew at 6.5% annual rate in the second quarter, missing expectations for nearly 8.5% growth. A closer look at the numbers however showed consumer spending topped expectations.
The upside surprise in consumer spending offset weekly jobless claims data and gave a boost to economically-linked cyclical stocks including energy, materials and financials.
Optimism in the stock market overcame concerns about rising cases of the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus, which have prompted companies and local and state governments to return to mask mandates, along with requirements for workers to be vaccinated in some cases.
To get more people to get their shots, President Joe Biden is calling for state and local to pay $100 to every newly vaccinated American, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing the U.S. Treasury Department.
In the most highly anticipated initial public offering so far this year,  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) began trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday and tumbled about 10% from its offering price of $38. It closed its first day down 8%.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Amazon reports tonight
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s second-quarter earnings per share, scheduled to be reported Thursday evening, is seen at $12.24 on revenue of $115.33 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2. Consumer giant reports
Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), maker of a huge array of consumer and household products, is seen posting revenue of $18.37 billion and EPS of $1.09 when it declares its fourth-quarter results on Friday.
3. Oil major outlook
Major oil company  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) is expected report EPS of $1.09 and revenue of $18.37 billion for the second quarter. The company should benefit from the rise in crude oil prices since the start of the year on the economic reopening.

LONDON (Reuters) -Carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), plane maker Airbus and energy major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) all posted bumper financial earnings on Thursday reflecting a generally buoyant mood among European companies emerging from the coronavirus pandemic.
European stocks hit record highs, taking their cue from the positive outlook and increased investor payouts offered by many companies reporting on one of the busiest days on the financial calendar. (EU)
There were some clouds on the horizon - strong sales figures from Swiss foods group Nestle and brewer Anheuser Busch InBev were offset by concerns about the impact of higher costs on their businesses.
Volkswagen trimmed its estimate for an increase in car deliveries to customers because of a shortage of computer chips, and Finnish telecoms equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) also warned that the same issue was putting the brakes on its healthy growth.
But business is clearly picking up from the lows of 2020 when efforts to contain the coronavirus forced consumers to stay home and businesses to cut output.
Analysts at investment house Pictet said equities in developed markets were enjoying ""a positive feedback loop in 2021, with stronger economic recovery increasing sales growth, improving margins and earnings set to rebound by 40% in 2021 in the US and Europe"". 
Airbus, now the world's largest planemaker, led the way by doubling its full-year profit forecast and raising the outlook for jet deliveries.
Shell boosted its dividend and launched a $2 billion share buyback programme after a sharp rise in oil and gas prices drove second-quarter profits to their highest in more than two years.
It joined peers TotalEnergies and Norway's Equinor in announcing share buybacks as companies throw off more cash than they can reinvest.
Figures earlier in the week showed the luxury goods industry had rebounded strongly since the start of the year, fuelled by robust demand in Asia and the United States for European brands such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci.
""In Europe, having more industry than tech is good for index profits, which I expect to be revised upwards,"" said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor SIM in Milan.
NOT OVER YET
Both U.S. and European equities have been hitting record highs but some see better prospects in Europe. 
Daniel Grosvenor, Director Equity Strategy at Oxford Economics, said in a research note on Wednesday that the Eurozone recovery was ""continuing to pick-up speed at a time when growth momentum looks to have peaked in the U.S.""
The ""relative growth gap between the two economies will continue to close as we go into 2022, and this is an environment in which European equities have typically outperformed"", Grosvenor wrote. 
In Britain, Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) swung to a first-half profit and announced an interim dividend, boosted by a house-buying frenzy and improved economic outlook.
The positive update from the bellwether mortgage lender came after rival  Barclays  (LON:BARC) also posted upbeat earnings on Wednesday, and showed how banks' profits are recovering as fears of pandemic-related bad loans ebb.
Quarterly revenue at AB InBev, whose brands include Budweiser and Stella Artois, rose above pre-pandemic levels as bars reopened around the world and drinkers emerged to toast the end of lockdown.
Increased costs of cans and distribution weighed on profits in its two biggest markets, the United States and Brazil, amplifying inflation warnings from consumer goods giants Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Reckitt Benckiser this month.
Monetary policy experts around the world are pondering how to respond to higher costs and debating whether the trend is temporary or more deeply rooted.
""Inflation has been virtually absent for a number of years and then pointed up very sharply. It hit us directly,"" said Nestle CEO Mark Schneider, adding he believed the problem was transitory.
Smurfit Kappa, one of the world's biggest packaging groups, warned on Wednesday that prices would keep climbing.
""It's very hard to see that inflation is not here to stay. Since the end of last year I've been saying we're seeing very significant increases and it's hard to see that they're temporary because there is still so much demand out there,"" CEO Tony Smurfit told Reuters.
There are also concerns that coronavirus could once again upset the best laid business plans, given the risk posed by the Delta variant.
""COVID-19 is not over,"" Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told reporters on Thursday.

""Levels of vaccinations are very diverse around the world and we cannot exclude that after the Delta variant there will be another one, so we believe we have to remain very prudent,"" he said.
""It is going to a bumpy road in terms of recovery.""

1273,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>",Biden Seeking Pledge for 40% of U.S. Car Sales to Be EV by 2030,"(Bloomberg) -- The White House is negotiating to have automakers pledge that 40% or more of the vehicles they sell in the U.S. will be electric by the end of the decade, something the companies say will require the government to help promote the use of the cars.
Brian Rothenberg, a spokesman for the United Auto Workers, said the union is in discussions with the White House and carmakers about a sales target, but he said an agreement has not been reached. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). also said no agreement has been reached.
A second person familiar with the negotiations also confirmed the talks on an EV sales target are happening but said there’s no agreement and the talks are still at an early stage. A pledge on new car sales will be significant because while some U.S. automakers have promised to convert their model lineups to electric vehicles, they haven’t made any promises on volumes.
Automakers are looking for support from the government in meeting those goals, such as subsidies or funding for charging infrastructure like that contained in a bill working its way through the Senate now.
Representatives for the White House and Stellantis NV, formerly known as Fiat Chrysler, declined to comment. GM, in a statement, said “we do not have an agreement to comment on at this time.” The talks were previously reported by the Washington Post.
“Ford has already said that we are leading the electrification revolution and planning on at least 40% of our global vehicle volume being all-electric by 2030,” Melissa Miller, a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement. CEO “Jim Farley said Wednesday that customer reaction to EVs so far is exceeding our expectations, and we’re going to stay ahead of customer demand.”
An agreement with automakers could help build support for a $550 billion, bipartisan infrastructure deal that passed a procedural hurdle in the Senate this week. The bill would dole out $7.5 billion to help build a nationwide network of electric vehicle chargers, an amount that would nearly double all prior public investment by utilities, states and the federal government in those critical charge points.
The White House has not said how many charging stations the money will pay for, but it said the funding represents the “first-ever national investment in EV charging infrastructure in the United States.”
But it’s still just a fraction of the $87 billion analysts and environmentalists say is needed this decade to swiftly electrify the nation’s cars and trucks that will require reliable access to electrons.
“In context, it’s a big investment, but relative to the amount that’s needed to really set us up for 100% electrification, it’s a down payment,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Public Policy, a research firm that analyzes the EV market.
Ryan Gallentine, a policy director with Advanced Energy Economy, a group that supports greater electrification, called the Senate spending measure “a good start” that will buttress automakers’ EV plans.
In many places, getting charging stations installed will require upgrades in power transmission and other systems to support them, Gallentine said.
“There’s a lot of factors that play into the number of actual chargers we get,” Gallentine said. “States are going to have to look at the amount of money they are going to get out of this package and decide how they will want to spend it.”
Climate Goals
A rapid rollout of electric vehicle charging stations is seen as critical to building consumer support for the cars and meeting President Joe Biden’s goal of halving U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade.
Automakers are also lobbying for an expansion of the electric vehicle tax credit, currently valued at as much as $7,500. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and GM have already passed a 200,000-per-manufacturer ceiling at which the value of those credits phases down.
With EV sales hitting monthly records and analysts predicting those plug-in cars will reach nearly 70% of the passenger vehicle market by 2040 -- more charging infrastructure is urgently needed, Nigro, with the Atlas Policy Group, said.
“We have a growing need for more and more infrastructure to accommodate that demand,” he said. “And if we’re actually going to approach the level of EV market share that many states are now setting as goals, we need an order of magnitude more infrastructure.”
In March Biden asked Congress to dedicate $174 billion to electric vehicle investments -- including by installing a network of half a million chargers nationwide. As lawmakers debated the details of that spending, the administration pressed for $15 billion, while some senators pushed for $2.5 billion.
Grant Program
At $7.5 billion, the electric vehicle charging spending in the infrastructure deal developed by a bipartisan working group of senators reflects a middle ground.
Although legislative language was not immediately available Thursday, Bracewell LLP Principal Liam Donovan said the measure is likely to be modeled after provisions of a surface transportation bill approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee earlier this year.
That bill would set up a grant program for alternative fuel corridors and community grants, with the aim of strategically deploying EV chargers and other infrastructure for public use. States, local governments, Indian tribes and other entities could seek the grants, and recipients could use the money to contract with private companies to install the systems and pay for the first five years of operations.
The planned program dwarfs the $1.25 billion the state and federal government have invested in electric vehicle charging to date, including some $400 million from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, according to Atlas figures. It also eclipses the $2.7 billion in approved electric vehicle charging investments by utilities tracked by Atlas.

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 02:21PM ET</span>",Pet food shortages leave owners on the hunt for kibble and cat treats,"By Tom Polansek and Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Black short-haired kitty Astra, one of millions of pets acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, had to go without salmon-flavored Whiskas treats that were sold out at stores in New Orleans this month. 
Loki, an Alaskan malamute dog in Ontario, Canada, did not have his usual Royal Canin kibble in the food bowl.
North American pet owners are struggling to track down certain foods from major retailers like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and PetSmart as the sector grapples with increased demand and strains on the supply chain.
Costs for pet food ingredients have climbed 8% to 20% since the pandemic began, according to U.S. industry group the Pet Food Institute, outpacing a 5.4% jump in consumer prices in the 12 months through June.
Higher prices of basic foodstuffs such as corn, soy and meat, on top of rising transportation and labor costs, are affecting all food supplies - both for animals and people - as the U.S. economy picks up steam.
""The pet supply chain isn't that different from the food supply chain,"" said Coye Nokes, partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants. ""That has obviously been really stressed by COVID – whether it's the ingredients, raw materials, processing or downtime at different facilities.""
Prices for U.S. corn and soybeans, key ingredients in many pet foods, reached eight-year highs this spring, pinching manufacturers that use the crops.
Pet food makers are also facing increased competition for animal- and plant-based oils because more of those are going into renewable fuel supplies, according to the Pet Food Institute.
""Unprecedented price increases for ingredients and equipment jeopardize U.S. pet food makers' ability to plan and execute strategies that will ensure America's dog and cat food bowls are filled,"" the institute warned U.S. agriculture officials in a June letter.
Supply constraints are taking pet owners by surprise, and there are many more owners since the pandemic began. About 12.6 million U.S. households indicated they acquired a new pet from March to December 2020, according to the American Pet Products Association.
In New Orleans, Aura Bishop, 39, searched local stores for weeks to find her cat Astra's favorite treats, made by Mars Petcare. The company, the world's biggest pet food producer, declined to comment.
The shortages were an inconvenience for the writer and actress, who said Astra helped her cope with anxiety and depression during the pandemic. 
""I wish she was less of a finicky eater and would eat other flavors,"" Bishop said. ""It does feel a little silly to go on this quest to find specific flavors of kibble and treats.""
EXTRA WORK FOR CHARITIES Limited supplies have made extra work for animal charities like the South Shore Pet Food Pantry near Boston. 
Cofounder Kristen Clancy said she reviews online wish lists for pet food on sites like Amazon and Target about every two weeks, instead of every two to three months previously, because products are more frequently sold out. She updates the lists manually to provide alterative items for donors to buy.
Over the U.S. Independence Day holiday weekend, Clancy said she updated all the items on her Target list because they were not available. 
""It can be time consuming because we're looking for substitutions that are beneficial for the animals but are also cost effective for the people who are making a donation,"" she said.
Target declined to comment.
Amazon said pet food manufacturers are prioritizing top-selling items over niche products because of increased demand. Pet treats and food brands that focus on health and wellness are popular as more people treat their animals as family, according to the company. SHOPPING PATTERNS CHANGE
Retailers are working with suppliers to keep pace with customers' demand and changes in shopping patterns so they do not lose business.
U.S. consumers spent nearly $26 billion on pet food from July 2020 to July 2021, up 4.7% from a year earlier and 7.8% from two years earlier, according to NielsenIQ.
Supply shortages reduced online retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY)'s net sales by $40 million in the quarter that ended May 2, but they were still up 31.7% from a year earlier at $2.1 billion, the company said. 
Operating profits for  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS)' pet division rose 6% to $415 million in the fiscal year ended May 30 as bigger net sales trumped higher input costs. The company, which sells Blue Buffalo pet food, recently bought  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN)' pet treats business for $1.2 billion. ""Everything is doing well, because there's more pets and more premiumization, but you're seeing people switch faster than we've ever seen,"" said Bethany Quam, president of General Mills' pet segment, about changes in where people shop.

In Ontario, Mariella Garcia, 20, said she came up empty in June when she searched Amazon and PetSmart websites for a Royal Canin dog food made by Mars. At the time, COVID-19 restrictions prevented her from entering retail pet stores to shop for her dog Loki, named after the Marvel comic character.
""I was just in shock,"" Garcia said. ""It's usually always in stock.""

1278,By StockNews,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>","Forget NIO, These 4 Auto Manufacturers Are Better Buys","Nio (NYSE:NIO) is losing momentum due to its extreme overvaluation amid the global semiconductor chip shortage and investors’ reduced interest in Chinese stocks following a broad-based crackdown by China on U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. Conversely, we believe global leaders in the auto manufacturing space—Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) (VWAGY), Honda (HMC), Isuzu (ISUZY), and Polaris (NYSE:PII)—are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry’s revival. So, these stocks are better bets now than NIO. Please read on.The shares of one of the most popular electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers in China,  NIO Inc . (NIO), have gained 241% in price over the past year owing to the growing adoption of EVs in China. However, the stock has lost momentum of late on reduced investor interest in Chinese stocks because of China’s regulatory crackdown on U.S.-listed Chinese stocks and its overvaluation amid a global semiconductor chip shortage.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which measures U.S.-listed Chinese stocks, has declined 22.2% over the past month because the Cyberspace Administration of China admonished ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc. (DIDI) for breaching national security with its data management, thus causing investors to lose some faith in Chinese stocks. Consequently, NIO has declined 15.3% over the past month. Furthermore, NIO reported a 183% year-over-year increase in its net loss to $744.10 million for its fiscal first quarter despite a surge in its vehicle deliveries. A current semiconductor chip supply crunch is expected to continue affecting NIO’s product deliveries in the coming quarters. Given the company’s weak growth potential, we think it looks overvalued at its current price level. NIO’s 12.57x forward Price/Sales is 881.9% higher than the 1.28x industry average. NIO closed yesterday’s session at $41.84, which is 37.5% lower than its 52-week high.
While the semiconductor chip shortage is putting pressure on automobile companies worldwide, rising demand and better production capacity should drive growth for some of the global leaders in the space. We believe fundamentally sound auto manufacturers Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), Isuzu Motors Limited (ISUZY), and Polaris Inc. (PII) are well-positioned to outperform the broader market in the near terms based on their latest developments. So, these stocks are better investments than NIO now.

Amid this volatile environment, because overpriced mega players are more likely to witness a correction, we believe it would be prudent to bet on relatively lesser-known stocks, such as H & M Hennes & Mauritz (HNNMY), CEMEX (CX), and Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY). They are each currently trading below $10 and have the potential to generate substantial returns. Let’s take a close look at these names.Many investors expect the stock market to experience a sell-off in the near term due to rising concerns surrounding the spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant. Also, because the consumer price index rose 5.4% year-over-year in June, representing its biggest jump since 2008, investors are concerned about inflation’s potential impact on the stock market. 
Although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed is nowhere near considering a rate hike, investor jitters around the aforementioned factors could lead to several overpriced stocks suffering corrections in the near term.
In these uncertain times, fundamentally sound low-priced stocks could be safer bets. H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (HNNMY), CEMEX S.A.B de C.V (CX), and Mazda Motor Corporation (MZDAY) are currently trading below $10 and exhibit strong fundamentals. So, we think it could be wise to bet on these under-the-radar stocks now.

High-end fashion labels have benefited from booming Chinese and U.S. demand in recent quarters, helping revenues at luxury goods groups like LVMH bounce back, and L'Oreal posted similar trends as vaccination campaigns progress and people begin to socialise more. 
The French group, which also owns brands like Lancome and makes Armani cosmetics, said sales of high-end perfumes were on the rise, while makeup revenues, which have been struggling for several years, were recovering. 
New Chief Executive Nicolas Hieronimus, a L'Oreal veteran who took the helm in May, told Le Figaro newspaper that cosmetics and fragrances sales had yet to recover to pre-2020 levels, although the group's overall revenues are now growing versus 2019. 
Some of the L'Oreal divisions which have faltered compared to others, such as the consumer goods unit that houses products sold in supermarkets, benefited from the makeup uptick. The professional products division that sells to hair salons also posted a big revenue jump. 
L'Oreal had relied on its e-commerce business during lockdowns last year to reach consumers, who lapped up hair care treatments and skin creams, but store closures hurt sales. 
Overall group sales reached 7.6 billion euros ($9.03 billion) in the second quarter, growing by 33.5% when stripping out currency swings and acquisitions. That was up from 10.2% like-for-like sales growth in the previous three months, and beat a consensus for 27.5% growth cited by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
Hieronimus said in a statement there would be more product launches in the second half of 2021. 

Operating margins rose to 19.7% of sales by the end of the first half, with operating profit up 26.8% to 3 billion euros.

Investing.com – PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock fell more than 5% Thursday as its second-quarter revenue came in below expectations, leading to worries that the damage from its former parent eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) moving payments away from it could be greater than anticipated.
Paypal and eBay parted ways in 2018 as the latter wanted to give shoppers more control over their online experience, much like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), giving them options to pay for their purchases.
eBay marketplaces represented 4% of its total payments volume in the second quarter compared to 17% in second quarter five years ago. PayPal expects that to further dilute to less than 3% as it exits 2021, calling eBay marketplaces a headwind to its growth in 2021.
Total revenue in the second quarter rose 19% to $6.24 billion, missing the estimated $6.27 billion.
Adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis came in at $1.15 and surpassed analysts’ expectation of $1.12.
The company processed payments amounting to $311 billion in the second quarter, growing 40% as users turned to online sites for nearly everything, from paying to watch content to ordering food to buying clothes and groceries.
It added 11.4 million net new active accounts to close the quarter at 403 million.
PayPal said it expects third-quarter net revenue to be in the range of about $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion and adjusted EPS at $1.07.

MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's High Court has dropped a formal investigation into the chairman of oil company Repsol (OTC:REPYY) Antonio Brufau after it found no evidence of his alleged participation in a decade-old spying case, a court document showed on Thursday.
The investigating judge Manuel Garcia Castellon also dismissed an investigation against former Caixabank chairman Isidro Faine and the companies Repsol and Caixabank.
The High Court had put all of them under investigation as part of a probe into the case of alleged spying.
Both companies said they welcomed the decision by the court to close the probe and pledged in any case to fully cooperate with judicial authorities.
Castellon was investigating whether Repsol and Caixabank hired Grupo Cenyt, a security firm belonging to former police chief Jose Manuel Villarejo, to spy on the then chairman of construction company Sacyr, Luis del Rivero, in 2011 and 2012.
The alleged aim was to block a takeover bid for Repsol by Sacyr and Mexican state oil firm Pemex.
Repsol was then partly owned by Caixabank.
On Thursday, the court said ""without evidence that the chairmen of the companies were directly involved in the events under investigation, it is not possible to put them under corporate supervision and oversight.""
The court also said in its ruling that both companies had adequate measures in place to prevent the commission of the offences under investigation.
Castellon was investigating Brufau and Faine for any possible links to bribery, in connection with both companies' alleged dealings with Villarejo.
No formal charges had been brought as the probe was in its first phase.

The investigation is part of a wider inquiry, centered on Villarejo's activities, that has roiled Spain's corporate sector, causing some reputational damage, but with no clear impact on companies' businesses so far.
Spanish bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) and Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) Renovables Energia, a unit of power company Iberdrola in Spain, remain under investigation in relation to Villarejo's activities.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 01:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive - AstraZeneca exploring options for COVID-19 vaccine business - executive,"By Alistair Smout and Pushkala Aripaka
LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is exploring options for the future of its COVID-19 vaccine and expects greater clarity on the matter by the end of 2021, a senior executive said on Thursday, following a series of setbacks in its race to produce a shot for the world.
Executives emphasised it was too early to say what the decision on the vaccine's future or the outcome of the review would be.
AstraZeneca agreed to work with the University of Oxford on its COVID-19 shot last year despite having no prior vaccine experience, taking on the project with a pledge not to make a profit during the coronavirus pandemic.
While a $39 billion dollar deal to buy rare drug firm Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN) is much more integral to the company's business strategy, the COVID-19 vaccine has quickly become the public face of the company's efforts during the coronavirus pandemic.
""If you ask me, is the vaccine business a sustainable business for AstraZeneca for the next five or 10 years, that big strategic question is under discussion,"" Ruud Dobber, head of the BioPharmaceuticals business, told Reuters.
A small group of staff reporting to research chief Mene Pangalos and Dobber are looking into this, he said.
""We need to have that discussion with our senior executive team, and then with the board of AstraZeneca. We are exploring different options, but it is far too early at this stage to conclude that (process),"" he said.
""Hopefully before the year ends, we will have a better view how to move forward in the next few years.""
SETBACKS
Production problems forced the company to cut deliveries to the European Union earlier in the year, prompting the bloc to launch a legal challenge. 
The vaccine has also faced age restrictions due to being linked to rare clots and its application for U.S. approval is taking longer than expected.
Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said he had no regrets over getting involved in COVID-19 vaccines as the company has made an ""enormous difference"".
It has delivered one billion doses around the world globally and is celebrated by the British government as a national success story of the pandemic. 
Dobber said that AstraZeneca's ""number one commitment"" was to deliver hundreds of millions of vaccine doses that were covered by current contracts, but it was open to talks with governments asking the company about supplies for 2022.
""It's not a distraction,"" he said of the vaccine, adding that data on factors such as the durability of the shots are still being collected from the real-world roll-out of the shot.
""There are still a huge number of basic questions we need to answer, moving forwards, and therefore, we're not in a rush in order to come to a final conclusion about what to do as a next step."" 
Asked about the future of the vaccine on an analyst call, Soriot played down Dobber's comments.
""We are of course are going to look at the way forward, but we haven't got any specific timeline for this... our priority hasn't been to look at what we're going to do moving forward,"" he told analysts.
Dobber added that the company would keep its pledge to deliver a broadly available and accessible vaccine. Soriot has said that the vaccine will always be kept affordable for low-income countries, even when the company moves away from a no-profit model.
Results released on Thursday showed sales of the vaccine in the second quarter more than tripled to $894 million from the first three months of the year, making it one of its top-selling products.

But, unlike for rivals including  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), it remains a drag on earnings overall, and Dobber said that if the vaccine business were to be sustainable, the company would have to stop making a loss on it.
""It's not sustainable to do it without profits, but it's too early now to speculate about that,"" Dobber said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Pan-European financial markets operator Euronext said on Thursday it has begun assessing how to cut reliance on a London Stock Exchange clearing house in Paris after acquiring an alternative in Italy.
Euronext, which runs the Paris, Milan and Amsterdam stock markets among others, uses the LSE's LCH SA clearing house for its share trades, but since acquiring Borsa Italiana from the London exchange in April, it now has its own clearing house, CC&G.
Work has begun on a possible switch for customers.
""It's a work in progress to assess how much, which assets, at what pace, with which clients and in what time frame,"" Euronext Chief Executive Stephane Boujnah told reporters during a second-quarter results conference call.
""It's a very heavy-lifting project we are willing to implement if appropriate,"" he said, adding that full ownership of CC&G - Euronext owns 11.1% of LCH SA - creates new incentives for the exchange.
It is the latest sign of how the European Union wants to build ""strategic autonomy"" in financial services to cut reliance on London after Britain left the bloc last December.
Brussels is piling pressure on banks to shift clearing in euro derivatives, which LCH in London dominates, to Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt.
Euronext said net income rose 5.6% to 86.6 million euros ($102.9 million) in the second quarter from a year ago, helped by consolidating Borsa Italiana into the group.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 53.8% to 192.9 million euros in the three months, with adjusted earnings per share up 26.8% at 1.43 euros. 
Borsa Italiana revenue growth was mainly driven by the ""remarkable performance"" of the Italian exchange's MTS fixed income platform, Euronext said.
Boujnah said MTS could capture even more trading flows from EU plans to issue bonds to finance the bloc's recovery from COVID in coming years.

Euronext will release its new strategic plan and 2024 group guidance in November.

Between January and June, earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) rose 37% over the prior year to 400 million euros.
Revenues grew 7.9% thanks to solid demand for helicopters and defence electronics. Leonardo's aerostructure business, which makes parts for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus, saw a 35.5% fall because of the protracted negative impact of the pandemic.
Leonardo expects full-year core earnings of between 1.075 billion and 1.125 billion euros and a fall in net debt to 3.2 billion euros.
Leonardo CEO Alessandro Profumo said in a statement the group remained cautious on the timing of an eventual recovery in civil aviation despite some recent ""positive signs.""

The Rome-based group also said it was sticking to a plan to list its U.S. unit DRS when market conditions allowed, after pulling the initial public offering in March due to expected cuts in U.S. defence spending.

By Jessica DiNapoli and Dan Levine
(Reuters) -A U.S. congressional panel has asked Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to provide it all documents related to the company's plans to put its talc liabilities into bankruptcy, according to a letter sent on Wednesday and seen by Reuters. 
Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform's subcommittee on economic and consumer policy, wrote that the panel is trying to learn how J&J's plans may affect people who have said they were harmed by the company's baby powder. 
Krishnamoorthi also asked J&J to turn over documents showing how much funding it would provide to the new entity. The level of funding could determine payouts for victims.
Reuters reported this month https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/exclusive-jj-exploring-putting-talc-liabilities-into-bankruptcy-sources-2021-07-18 that J&J is exploring a plan to offload liabilities it faces from baby powder litigation into a new company, which would then file for bankruptcy.
The healthcare company faces legal actions from tens of thousands of plaintiffs, including women suffering from ovarian cancer and others with mesothelioma, alleging that its baby powder and other talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer.
""Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc has not decided on any particular course of action in this litigation other than to continue to defend the safety of talc and litigate these cases in the tort system, as the pending trials demonstrate,"" the company said in a statement.
The statement did not address the subcommittee's request for documents.
The House subcommittee held hearings on carcinogens in baby powder in 2019 and has heard from people suffering from mesothelioma and ovarian cancer.
Separately, plaintiff attorneys filed a fresh legal challenge intended to prevent J&J from pursuing a bankruptcy for its baby powder liabilities. 

They asked a Delaware judge overseeing a separate bankruptcy involving J&J's former talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, to prohibit the maneuver, arguing it would evade obligations J&J has to Imerys Talc America, according to court documents filed on Wednesday.
A J&J spokesperson did not respond to questions about the legal challenge.

LONDON (Reuters) - The strong economic recovery in the United States has led to a record number of corporate credit rating upgrades this year, figures from S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) showed on Thursday.
The combination of vaccine rollouts, reopening the economy and ultra-low borrowing costs has boosted firms' finances and made debt piles more manageable.
S&P said it had made a record 121 upgrades during the second quarter and 220 since the start of the year although that was still well below the 715 downgrades during the first half of last year as the pandemic spread.
Most of the upgrades in recent months have been of lower-rated firms with 58% of all upgrades of issuers rated 'B' and lower. They have also been led by several of the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, and about half were of issuers that had been downgraded since the start of 2020. 
The proportion of firms at risk of downgrades also fell by eight percentage points to 19%, and is now below its long-term average of 22%. 
""This steady decline points to a further decrease in downgrade potential and indicates the number of quarterly downgrades should continue to fall,"" S&P said.
The surge in oil and gas prices over the last 12 months mean the sector's negative rating bias has fallen 39 percentage points this year, the most of any U.S. sector, although it remains fractionally above the long term average. 

The retail and restaurant sector's negative bias has fallen 32 percentage points this year, the second most among all sectors, while the media and entertainment sector's 33% negative bias is the highest despite a 20 percentage points drop.
""We expect the recovery of pre-2020 credit metrics to be uneven, with the hardest-hit industries of out-of-home entertainment and hotels not expected to recover before 2023 and even later for the cruise industry,"" S&P said.

(Reuters) -Comcast Corp's second-quarter revenue beat Wall Street estimates on Thursday, benefiting from record broadband subscriber and total cable customer additions.
The pandemic has created a distinction between digital businesses and those that are more reliant on in-person interactions. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has a mix of both.
Total revenue rose 20.4% to $28.55 billion in the quarter, beating analysts' estimates of $27.18 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company, which is the largest cable operator in the United States, gained 354,000 broadband customers as people continued to work and learn from home, the strongest second quarter on record, compared with Factset estimates of 272,000.
During its earnings call, the company said it expects total broadband net additions for 2021 to increase “mid-teens” relative to 2019. 
Comcast said its NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service had 54 million sign-ups as of this week, including over 20 million active monthly accounts. Comcast is including Peacock at no additional cost for its 20 million Sky customers across Europe later this year, Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts said. 
When asked whether NBCUniversal has enough scale to achieve its global streaming goals, Roberts said: “I think (CFO) Mike Cavanagh has been very upfront that we don't need M&A. We have a majority broadband-centric company, and we like the mix. So what might that drive us to consider at least, which is any kind of partnership where we have unique, special capabilities that could lead globally or internationally to enhancing our streaming position - that's something you might talk to others and consider.”
NBC's broadcast of the Tokyo Olympic Games opening ceremony drew 16.9 million viewers, the smallest U.S. television audience for the event in the past 33 years, according to Nielsen data provided by NBCUniversal. 
Both the average primetime TV audience and the total audience on TV and streaming combined for the subsequent four nights declined on every night except Sunday.
Referring to the lack of spectators and postponement from 2020, NBCUniversal Chief Executive Jeff Shell (LON:RDSa) said Thursday that ""with all this bad luck"" the company is going to be profitable in the Olympics. He described traditional TV ratings as ""probably less than we expected."" 
Theme park revenue amounted to $1.1 billion during the quarter versus just $136 million a year ago, when stay-at-home orders crippled the business.
Universal's big-budget action spectacle ""F9"" and animated feature ""Boss Baby 2"" bolstered NBC's studios business, which had been hammered by COVID-related production delays and theater closures. Revenue rose 8.4% to $2.22 billion.
Comcast posted a nearly 33% rise in ad sales at NBCUniversal Media.

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 84 cents in the second quarter, beating estimates of 67 cents.
Shares of the company rose 2.4%, after having gained about 12.8% this year.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 12:16PM ET</span>",AstraZeneca COVID-19 sales jump as drugmaker navigates vaccine challenges,"By Pushkala Aripaka and Alistair Smout
(Reuters) -Second-quarter sales of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine more than tripled to $894 million from the first quarter, but the drugmaker on Thursday again delayed its U.S. application for approval as it gathers more data for submissions.
The vaccine has been touted as a major weapon against the pandemic because it is cheaper and easier to use than some rivals. AstraZeneca and its Indian manufacturing partner say they have supplied a billion doses to 170 countries so far.
The company began work on the vaccine last year after teaming up with the University of Oxford, despite having no prior vaccine experience.
But the shot has also faced setbacks, including disputes over data, production problems, and links to rare side-effects that have led some countries to stop or restrict its use. The United States has been particularly critical of the vaccine. 
AstraZeneca said on Thursday it now expected to seek U.S. approval for the vaccine in the second half of this year, and it still hopeful the shot will have a role to play there. Previously, it had planned an application during the first half.
A senior executive separately told Reuters that the company was exploring options for the future of its COVID-19 vaccine business, with more clarity on the matter expected by the end of the year.
Elsewhere, AstraZeneca is hoping for a boost from the recent purchase of rare medicines business Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN).
Including Alexion, it now expects total revenue to increase by a low-twenties percentage this year, and core earnings of $5.05 to $5.40 per share. The forecasts do not include sales from the vaccine.
AstraZeneca shares fell 1.4% in early trade but had recovered the losses and edged higher by 1109 GMT. 
VACCINE WOES
The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker is also hoping to settle legal proceedings with the European Commission over vaccine delivery commitments. 
Despite setbacks, the company said the vaccine, Vaxzevria, brought in $1.17 billion in sales in the first six months of year, putting it among its best selling products, behind first-placed lung cancer drug Tagrisso on $2.54 billion. 
Vaccine sales were based on deliveries of about 319 million doses, it said, giving an average price of about $3.7 per dose. Deliveries from its partner, India-based Serum Institute, were not included. 
AstraZeneca has said it will not make a profit from the shot during the pandemic but hopes to eventually generate earnings to make the business sustainable. Costs related to the vaccine shaved a cent off second-quarter earnings per share. That was down from 3 cents in the previous three months.
The company said it was also looking into how long the vaccine's protection lasts and if a booster dose would be needed to keep up immunity.
""People received their second dose, at the earliest in March/April this year, so we need more time to know whether the protection is lasting or needs boosting,"" CEO Pascal Soriot said at a media briefing.

While AstraZeneca did not forecast vaccine sales for the year, rivals  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have guided to $33.5 billion, $19.2 billion and $2.5 billion for their COVID-19 shots, respectively. 
Total revenue of $8.22 billion for the three months to June beat analysts' consensus forecast of $7.58 billion. But core earnings of 90 cents per share fell short of an estimated 92 cents.

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 12:16PM ET</span>",Carlyle's second-quarter earnings double on asset sales,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) -U.S. buyout firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc said on Thursday its second-quarter distributable earnings nearly doubled following a sharp rise in asset divestments in its private equity and secondary market portfolios.
Carlyle joins peer Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc in reporting such strong results, as private equity firms take advantage of the economic recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic to cash out on many of their holdings for top dollar.
Carlyle's shares were up more than 6%, trading at $49.8 per share as of noon on Thursday.
The Washington-based firm said its distributable earnings, which represents the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders, rose to $395.4 million from $198.4 million a year earlier. 
This resulted in an after-tax distributable earnings per share of 88 cents, which surpassed the average Wall Street analyst estimate of 60 cents, according to Refinitiv.
Carlyle said it invested $8.1 billion during the quarter in new deals, including acquiring majority stakes in life sciences company Unchained Labs for $435 million and British online fashion retailer End for an undisclosed amount. It also committed to spend $6 billion on new deals, including the acquisition of a majority stake in medical supplier Medline Industries Inc alongside Blackstone and Hellman & Friedman.
The buyout firm said it generated $8.7 billion as proceeds from asset sales, including the divestment of its minority stake in music executive Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings and the sale of its majority stake in healthcare provider MedRisk to CVC Capital Partners.
""Industry and macro conditions are favorable and that resulted in increased activity. We're seeing growth in private equity opportunities from disruptors and companies that want our capital to grow,"" Carlyle Chief Executive Kewsong Lee said in an interview.
Carlyle said its private equity and credit funds appreciated by 12% and 8%, respectively. Funds managed under its AlpInvest business, which includes secondary and co-investment vehicles, rose 12%. By contrast, Blackstone said its private equity portfolio grew 13.8% in the second quarter, while its private credit unit returned 4.8%.
Carlyle said the appreciation of its funds drove net accrued performance revenues, which represent outstanding investment profits that are yet to be cashed, to $4 billion.
""This is made possible in large part because our funds are generating attractive returns and our net accrued carry balance is at record levels,"" Lee said in an analyst conference call.

Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Carlyle posted a net income of $925 million, six times higher than the $146 million it reported a year earlier, driven by a jump in investment income.
Carlyle's total assets under management rose to a record $276 billion, up 6% from the prior quarter, owing to fund appreciation and strong fundraising activity. It ended the quarter with $77 billion in unspent capital and declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents.

(Reuters) -European stocks hit all-time highs on Thursday after strong earnings from commodity majors, Airbus and a clutch of other companies, while data showing record high euro zone economic sentiment in July added to the positive mood. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.5% to a closing high of 460.57 points. 
UK-listed Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) gained 3.8% and France's TotalEnergies added 2.2% after both companies announced share buybacks as a surge in oil and gas prices boosted their earnings.
Miners, already the best sectoral performers in 2021, jumped 2.4% after  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) boosted its shareholder payout to a record $4.1 billion. Rising silver and gold prices also boosted the sector. [GOL/]
Airbus edged 0.6% higher after the world's largest planemaker sharply raised its forecasts for full-year deliveries and earnings.
Strong quarterly earnings and optimism around European reopening put the STOXX 600 on course for its sixth straight month of gains despite lingering concerns about inflation and China's regulatory crackdown. 
""Globally diversified stocks have recorded the strongest EPS beats, while consumer stocks with high emerging market exposure have recorded the weakest,"" said Milla Savova, investment strategist at BofA, said in a note. 
Savova, however, noted that mentions of inflation by STOXX 600 companies have risen by more than 400% over the past year, leaving them at an all-time high in absolute terms. 
Investors drew comfort from a supportive stance by central banks after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said the U.S. job market still had ""some ground to cover"" before it was time to start withdrawing economic support.
Estimates from the European Commission showed sentiment in the 19-country single-currency bloc rose to 119.0 points in July, a record since data began to be collected in 1985.
""Never before has sentiment been so positive among eurozone businesses and consumers. This indicates that the economic rebound is in full swing,"" said Bert Colijn, senior economist, eurozone at ING.
Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) climbed 4.6% after it raised its full-year outlook as it benefits from a sharp turnaround in its business.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 12:05PM ET</span>",Merck sees recovery in non-COVID vaccine demand as quarterly sales beat estimates,"By Manas Mishra and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) -Merck & Co reported quarterly revenue on Thursday that topped Wall Street estimates, as sales of its Gardasil vaccine bounced back and demand for blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda remained strong. 
Sales of non-COVID-19 vaccines and physician-administered drugs are expected to recover as hospitals and clinics have started to adapt to the impact of the pandemic, Merck executives told investors. 
Merck, which failed in its efforts to produce a coronavirus vaccine, expects to have late-stage data for its COVID-19 antiviral, molnupiravir, in October, Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said. 
The U.S. drugmaker in June agreed to provide 1.7 million doses of the treatment being developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to the United States government for around $1.2 billion once it is cleared by regulators. Merck is also in supply talks with other countries. 
Demand for Gardasil, its vaccine to prevent cancers linked to the human papillomavirus, recovered sharply in the second quarter as patients started to catch up on routine medical visits skipped at the height of the pandemic.
Gardasil sales jumped 88% to $1.23 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $991.38 million. 
Recent improvements in the supply chain for the vaccine will drive ""very strong sequential and year-over-year growth for Gardasil in the back half of the year, especially in ex-U.S. markets,"" said Franklin Clyburn, president of Merck's human health business. 
Sales of cancer immunotherapy Keytruda rose 23% to $4.18 billion in the quarter, in line with estimates.
The company's top growth driver is on track to become the world's best-selling drug by 2023. 
Merck on Thursday said it had the financial flexibility to consider deals of all sizes and would focus on assets that could add to its strength in the cancer market. 
""We want to build upon that strength and actually see ourselves as a company that over time can be a broad player across oncology,"" said Merck's new Chief Executive Officer Robert Davis on an investor call. 
""One of the areas we continue to believe we do not need to go is to the very large synergy-driven deals. I think we have enough firepower in our own pipeline,"" he added.

The company's second-quarter sales rose 22% to $11.40 billion, beating estimates of $11.10 billion.
Merck reported adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share for the quarter, in-line with analyst estimates. Its share were down 1% in early trading.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 12:02PM ET</span>",Explainer-Robinhood makes most of its money from PFOF. What is it?,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - App-based retail brokerage  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) was set to make its highly anticipated market debut on the Nasdaq on Thursday.
The brokerage, known for helping pioneer commission-free trading, relied on a controversial practice called payment for order flow (PFOF) for more than three-quarters of its revenue https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm in the first quarter. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now scrutinizing PFOF over conflicts of interest it says are inherent in the practice.
WHAT IS PFOF?
Retail brokerages send the majority of their customers' orders to wholesale brokers, rather than to exchanges, because wholesalers generally execute the orders at a slightly better price than available on exchanges. Most retail brokers also accept rebates, or payments, from wholesalers in return for their customers' orders. 
HOW COMMON IS PFOF?
PFOF, which is disclosed in quarterly regulatory filings, has been a growing source of revenue for many brokers as retail trading volumes have surged.
Some retail brokerages, including  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp and Robinhood, accept PFOF, while others, including Fidelity and Public.com, do not. PFOF is banned in Canada, the UK, and Australia.
Robinhood has said PFOF allows it to offer commission-free trading. 
WHY DOES IT MATTER? 
The SEC is looking into whether PFOF creates an incentive for brokers to route customer orders to places that maximize PFOF rather than to the place that would get the customers the best execution. 
Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler also recently expressed concerns that commission-free trading brokerages may encourage investors to trade more, in order to capture more PFOF, even if that is not in the investors' best interest.
IS REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF PFOF NEW?
No. PFOF has been around for decades and the SEC has historically focused on disclosure of the practice, but its growth in recent years, as commission-free trading models have become the norm, along with an associated increase in off-exchange trading, has led to renewed attention. 
ISN'T FREE TRADING GOOD FOR EVERYONE?
In December, the SEC fined Robinhood $65 million for failing to properly inform its customers about PFOF it received that resulted in those customers paying higher prices to execute trades.

The regulator said certain wholesalers told Robinhood there was a trade-off between PFOF and price improvement for customers, and that Robinhood ""explicitly offered to accept less price improvement for its customers in exchange for receiving higher"" PFOF. 
The SEC said the costs to Robinhood's customers ""might have exceeded any savings they might have thought they'd gotten from zero commission trading."" Robinhood settled without admitting or denying the charges.

The firm estimates that managers with assets linked to the S&P 500, 400 and 600 indexes have had their expenses cut big time -- helping returns in a world where stock pickers keep failing to outperform benchmarks.
It has an admittedly vested interest in touting the virtues of all things passive, but the calculations are a reminder of the power of the industry 50 years after the birth of the first-ever index fund.
“In the 20 years ending in 2020, 94% of all large-cap U.S. managers lagged the S&P 500,” Anu Ganti, senior director of index investment strategy, wrote in a blog post this week. “As indexing has grown, investors have benefited substantially by saving on fees and avoiding underperformance.”
The figure is actually conservative because it excludes myriad other indexes, including from other major providers such as MSCI Inc. and FTSE Russell. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is also a competitor.
And as Ganti notes, for all their growth, indexed assets only accounted for 17% of market capitalization in 2020 -- leaving plenty of scope for expansion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -LinkedIn will allow employees to opt for full-time remote work or a hybrid option as offices gradually reopen, Chief People Officer Teuila Hanson told Reuters.
This new policy is a shift from the initial indication last October that  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s professional social networking site would expect employees to work from an office 50% of the time when COVID-19 pandemic restrictions lift.
The updated policy, offering the flexibility to work remotely full-time or work at an office part-time, will apply to LinkedIn's global workforce of more than 16,000 employees.
""We anticipate that we'll definitely see more remote employees than what we saw prior to the pandemic,"" Hanson said in a Wednesday interview ahead of the announcement, adding that some jobs would require in-office work.
Hanson said LinkedIn is not currently requiring employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to return to the office, in contrast to tech companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google that have responded to a rise in U.S. COVID-19 cases by requiring shots.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) is closing https://www.reuters.com/world/us/google-will-require-covid-19-vaccine-us-employees-step-into-campuses-2021-07-28 its recently reopened offices due to the surge in cases.
LinkedIn employees who move locations could see their pay adjusted based on the local market where they're based, said Greg Snapper, director of corporate communications.
The tech industry was among the first to allow employees to work from home when COVID-19 hit the United States last year. But the extent to which tech companies are embracing permanent remote work is now diverging.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will require most employees to work from the office three days per week starting in October, while Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) Inc and Reddit Inc will allow most employees to work remotely. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google expects 60% of its workforce to return to the office at least part-time. 
LinkedIn is reopening its global offices based on COVID-19 infection rates in each location.

Flight attendants cited mask compliance, alcohol, routine safety reminders, flight delays and cancellations as factors that led to the incidents.
Nearly three-fourths of the attendants who filed complaints with the airline management received no follow-up, and a majority did not observe efforts by their employers to address the rise in unruly passengers.

""I've been yelled at, cursed at, and threatened countless times in the last year and the most that has come out of it has been a temporary suspension of travel for the passenger,"" the statement said quoting a flight attendant.

Investing.com – Comcast stock (NASDAQ:CMCSA) rose 2% Thursday after the company’s second-quarter revenue and earnings both came in ahead of estimates.
The company rode both the themes derived from the pandemic: people watching content and shopping online at home and those wanting to break loose after a year of being home. It reflected in the numbers for those businesses.
Record subscriber additions in broadband and cable businesses, big movie releases like F9 and Boss Baby 2 and a bounce back in theme park footfalls all contributed to the boost in the company’s revenue.
The largest cable operator in the U.S. acquired 354,000 broadband customers, the best for any second quarter. Comcast also reported 280,000 wireless line additions.
Total customer relationships increased by 294,000 to 33.8 million, making it the best second quarter on record.
Revenue at the company’s U.K. business, Sky, jumped 28%, to $5.2 billion.
Theme parks delivered their first profitable quarter since the first three-month period of 2020. Quarterly revenue from theme parks was $1.09 billion, up from $136 million from last year when pretty much all activity was shut.
During its earnings call, the company said it expects total broadband net additions for 2021 to increase “mid-teens” relative to 2019, according to Reuters.
Overall revenue rose 21% to $28.54 billion, surpassing the estimated $27.13 billion. Earnings per share at 84 cents topped the expectation of 65 cents.

The variant, first identified in India, is now the dominant one worldwide and has led to a spike in infection rates that has stoked widespread concerns over a economic recovery.
LabCorp said it saw a sequential decline in COVID-19 testing each month through the year with tests performed in month of June falling below the second-quarter average of 54,000 PCR tests per day. 
""July was the first month, frankly, that we've seen the level of COVID testing higher than the prior month,"" said Glenn Eisenberg, LabCorp's Chief Financial Officer.
The comments echo those of Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX), which also saw demand for COVID-19 testing increase since the end of June.
LabCorp said it now believes reduction in testing would be lesser than what it had previously expected through the year.
The company's second quarter results saw it join other COVID-19 testing companies such as Quest Diagnostics and Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) in signaling a recovery in their mainstay businesses as mass inoculations prompted people to return to non-urgent care in the United States. 
LabCorp raised its 2021 adjusted profit between $21.50 and $25 per share from previous outlook of $20 to $24 per share on the back of the recovery, especially in its diagnostics unit which offers services such as genetic, pathology and drug monitoring tests.
The company said for the first time since the pandemic, its non-COVID-19 testing volumes rose in June compared to 2019 and expects continued growth through the year.
Excluding items, it earned $6.13 per share, beating analyst estimates of $5.53 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Revenue of $3.84 billion also topped estimates of $3.61 billion.

(Reuters) -  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick said he expects its $2.1 billion initial public offering (IPO) will demonstrate the benefits of allocating a significant chunk of stock to retail investors.
The IPO valued the trading app at $31.8 billion, at the low end of its indicated range, and its shares are set to begin trading on the Nasdaq later on Thursday. The offering was notable for Robinhood's decision to reserve between 20% and 35% of it for its users. 
""I think we're well-positioned for this to be a successful demonstration,"" Warnick said in an interview, noting Robinhood would have one of the largest retail allocations ever on a U.S. IPO.
The online brokerage has not yet disclosed how much of the IPO was bought by retail investors. Robinhood was contacting users last night to confirm their participation in the offering.
Robinhood used its IPO Access platform to administer the offering to its users. The IPO of scrubs maker Figs Inc earlier this year was the first to become available to Robinhood users, and the app is seeking to secure allocations to more IPOs.
Early indications on Thursday were that Robinhood shares were set to open slightly higher than the IPO price of $38.

Many IPOs benefit from excluding retail investors, who end up fueling a first-day trading pop by snapping up shares in the open market. By letting many retail investors under the IPO tent, Robinhood is making it less likely that investors will see big gains on the first day.
Robinhood has not instituted a lock-up for retail investors in the IPO but has said that those selling their IPO shares within 30 days of the listing may be prevented from participating in other IPOs through the app for 60 days.

(Reuters) -Mastercard Inc reported a second-quarter profit on Thursday that comfortably beat estimates, underpinned by a recovery in global spending as businesses start to reopen and travel shows signs of a rebound.
The company's cross-border volumes, which track spending on its cards beyond the country of issue, rose 58% on a local currency basis, driven by a pickup in international travel. The volumes had plunged 45% in the same period a year earlier.
""International travel is still in the early stages of recovery and represents additional upside potential,"" Chief Executive Officer Michael Miebach said.
Mastercard (NYSE:MA) saw improved strength in travel between the Unites States and Latin America, as well as an increase in travel within Europe, Miebach said on a conference call.
The company's shares were up about 2.6% at $393.74, as the upbeat results rounded out a positive quarter from payment processors including  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP).
U.S. consumer spend on airlines improved significantly since the early part of the quarter and volumes were now back to pre-pandemic levels, Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra said.
Cross-border travel in Asia Pacific has been slower to recover, Mehra said, adding that travel comeback in Asia is hard to predict due to the spread of coronavirus variants.
Consumer spending saw a spike during the quarter due to massive government stimulus packages, sending Mastercard's gross dollar volumes, or the dollar value of the transactions processed, up 33% on a local currency basis to $1.9 trillion.

Net income, excluding exceptional items, rose to $1.9 billion, or $1.95 per share, from $1.4 billion, or $1.36 per share a year earlier.

(Reuters) - Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, on Thursday reported that its second-quarter profit more than doubled, helped by the strong performance of its mortgage technology business.
Revenue at the mortgage tech unit came in at $340 million, up sixfold from the year-ago period as the exchange operator continued to benefit from its $11 billion acquisition of Ellie Mae, with the housing market booming amid rock-bottom interest rates coming out of the coronavirus pandemic.
""We're looking at taking this unprecedented time of volumes that the industry has seen last year and this year to purposely engage with our customers on opportunities to increase the amount of subscription revenue that we have and some of the services that we provide,"" said ICE President Benjamin Jackson.
Some of those services include loan originations as well as mortgage data and analytics, he said on a call with analysts.
Net income attributable to ICE more than doubled to $1.25 billion, or $2.22 per share, for the three months ended June 30, from $523 million, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the exchange operator posted a profit of $1.16 per share, in line with consensus Wall Street estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
ICE sold a minority stake in cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase for more than $1.2 billion in April.

(Reuters) - Canada and Mexico imported millions of doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine and offered them to the public without health officials properly inspecting the operations of the U.S. manufacturer, according to inspection records and the regulators involved.
The Baltimore plant belonging to Emergent BioSolutions Inc was producing vaccines for both AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) under a $628 million U.S. government contract. 
In late March, under pressure to help other nations access COVID-19 vaccines, the Biden administration released 1.5 million AstraZeneca doses to Canada, and 2.5 million to Mexico. 
European regulators had certified Emergent's factory as complying with ""good manufacturing practices,"" and on that basis both Canada and Mexico began using the vaccine, regulators in both countries told Reuters.
But the European Medicines Agency (EMA) told Reuters that the certification was based on a remote inspection that focused on a part of the facility that was not actually producing the AstraZeneca shots - a fact that has not been previously reported.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration halted production at the factory three weeks later, after J&J's vaccine was found to be contaminated with material used in the AstraZeneca shots.
FDA inspectors later documented unsanitary conditions and poorly-trained staff at the plant, which had been rapidly overhauled to make vaccines during the pandemic. Production had remained halted, with tens of millions of doses of both vaccines in regulatory limbo.
Emergent said on Thursday the FDA was allowing it to resume production of J&J doses at the Baltimore plant after completing additional regulatory reviews.
No reports of illness have been linked to vaccines manufactured by Emergent, and regulators have not alleged that contaminated vaccines were given to anyone. Emergent said there has been no evidence of contamination in the AstraZeneca shots produced at its site.
But details of the flawed approval process show blind spots that can develop when national regulators share responsibility for overseeing a complex global pharmaceutical industry. Those were only exacerbated given the urgency of the pandemic. 
""It's a risk, because who knows what the standards are that are being applied?"" said Joel Lexchin, a Canadian professor and expert in drug regulation. Health Canada typically relies heavily on foreign regulators, he said. ""It's a gap that exists outside of crisis times.""
Emergent said in a statement that it ""has worked with health officials around the world to ensure any vaccine drug substance we manufactured meets strict safety and quality requirements before being released.""
AstraZeneca said vaccines manufactured by Emergent were subject to more than 40 tests to meet its requirements for safety, purity and quality, and that its manufacturing standards ""are rigorously assessed and independently verified by regulators.""
Health Canada told Reuters it is confident the vaccines it received were safe, pointing in part to AstraZeneca's quality control systems. Mexico health regulator COFEPRIS said it remains ""confident that the approval process was carried out with all the necessary rigor.""
Canada signed deals to formally recognize some other regulators' certifications as early as 2003, and the United States and Europe reached similar deals in 2019.
A EUROPEAN INSPECTION
Early in the vaccine rollout, the European Union was due to receive doses of the J&J vaccine made by Emergent. In early February, Italian officials conducted a remote inspection of the plant that only focused on areas where J&J production was taking place ""and not the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was not manufactured at Emergent for the EU market,"" EMA said in a statement. 
Health Canada said it assumed both products would be made to the same standard. ""The quality systems assessed by the EMA for this product would be applicable to all similar products made at this site,"" it said in a statement.
This is the wrong approach, according to University of Ottawa professor Amir Attaran, who studies drug policy, including Health Canada's reliance on foreign regulators.
""It's precisely because they were similar (products) that cross contamination is a risk,"" he said. Canada was ""out on a limb"" approving AstraZeneca doses from the facility before the FDA, he said.
Health Canada said it reviewed test results and quality control steps for every vaccine lot sent to Canada.
Initially, Mexico's COFEPRIS told Reuters the FDA was responsible for certifying U.S. operations, but later confirmed that the factory had been certified by European regulators.
When Reuters shared the European regulators' statement that it had not assessed AstraZeneca production specifically, COFEPRIS said it would review the file, but remained confident in the approval process.
The Mexican regulator said vaccines went through quality control systems at Emergent, and twice more during the vial filling process handled by another contract manufacturer.
""When evaluating vaccines, the product and its entire production process are considered and examined,"" it said in a statement. 
Emergent's contract with the U.S. government is the focus of a Congressional investigation, which unearthed documents that highlight early concerns about the Baltimore plant.
Soon after the Trump administration announced Emergent's contract last summer, its own vaccine officials visited the plant and wrote a report flagging inadequate staffing and training. The report warned of the need to strengthen quality oversight, a process that would ""require significant resources and commitment.""
The FDA, following a February 2021 visit to the plant, noted in a June memo that Emergent staff turnover was high and record-keeping inadequate. While European regulators said they were aware of that visit, Health Canada said it did not learn about it until last month.
An FDA spokesperson said the agency works closely with international partners, and that it notified various health authorities of its findings after its April 2021 inspection of the Emergent facility.

Emergent said it is still working with the FDA to release more of the already produced COVID-19 vaccine batches.
""We have manufactured tens of millions of doses that could be used to help vaccinate people around the world as the pandemic shows no signs of slowing down,"" the company said.

Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) made the announcement in an update to investors on how it plans to deal with Roundup-related lawsuits that have dogged the company since it acquired the brand as part of its $63 billion purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
The decision comes after a U.S. judge in May rejected Bayer's plan to try to limit the cost of future class action over claims that Roundup causes cancer.
Thousands of users have alleged Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but Bayer has said decades of studies have shown Roundup, and key ingredient glyphosate, are safe for human use.
Bayer said it would file in August a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking a review of a lower court ruling that went in favour of Roundup user Edwin Hardeman.
The German company said a ruling in its favour by the Supreme Court would effectively end Roundup litigation. But it set aside the new provision for its base case that the court declines to hear the matter or ends up favoring the plaintiff.
The sum comes on top of $11.6 billion it was factoring for future settlements and litigation.
""We believe that the U.S. Supreme Court should give strong consideration to accepting our petition to review the Hardeman case and render a positive ruling,"" Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann said.

In addition, Bayer said that it was working on replacing glyphosate-based products with alternative ingredients starting in 2023 for its U.S. residential customers.
It said glyphosate formulas would remain the same for U.S. professional and agricultural markets.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top energy companies signalled confidence in a lasting recovery from the pandemic impact by drawing on higher oil prices to boost shareholder returns and reassure investors as they roll out risky climate strategies.
After swiftly cutting spending and jobs in response to the unprecedented collapse in energy demand last year, executives from Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), TotalEnergies and Norway's Equinor were eager to highlight the rapid reversal in fortunes. 
""We wanted to be really clear and signal to the market the confidence that we have in our prospects and our cash flows,"" Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said on Thursday, after Shell launched a $2 billion buyback programme and boosted its dividend for a second consecutive quarter, a year after cutting it for the first time since the 1940s.
Energy companies have come under heavy pressure from climate campaigners, governments and shareholders to speed up the shift from fossil fuels to cleaner sources.
While some investors welcome the change as they perceive carbon-intensive, fossil fuel energy as unsustainable, others are worried about the implications for profit margins of new business models.
Benchmark Brent crude oil prices more than doubled in the second quarter from a year earlier to around $69 a barrel, driven by recovering demand and tightening global supplies.
As profits surged, France's TotalEnergies also announced on Thursday plans to buy back shares. CEO Patrick Pouyanne said however that a large increase in dividends would not be reasonable yet and would be linked to higher cash flow.
The group said it expected to generate more than $25 billion in cash flow this year, based on current high oil price forecasts, and would invest in more new projects and return surplus amounts to shareholders if oil prices remained high.
Equinor also said on Wednesday it would begin a long-planned share buyback that will reach $300 million by the end of the third quarter after profits surged.
BP (NYSE:BP) reports its second quarter results on Aug. 3. It launched a $500 million buyback in the previous quarter after halving its dividend last year.
WEANING THEMSELVES OFF OIL
BP, as well as Shell, TotalEnergies and Equinor, plans to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades while reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
Oil prices are expected to remain elevated in the coming years as supplies stay tight because of lower investments.
High fossil fuel prices are double-edged. They can tempt operators to maximise conventional output, but they also produce income needed to invest in lower carbon sources.
Shell's free cash flow - money left after deducting spending and shareholder payouts - soared in the second quarter to $9.7 billion, its highest in a year, while debt also declined.
""The quarter proves without doubt that Shell's earnings power is intact and that they're willing to pay investors handsomely to come on their transformation journey,"" Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said.
TotalEnergies's results are a ""confirmation that the group is geared to the macro environment and can deliver both on the energy transition and cash returns to shareholders,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note. 
Despite the surge in revenue, Shell and TotalEnergies indicated they would stick to previous spending plans. 
Shell said it will not spend more than its planned $22 billion this year and any increases in the futures will go mostly towards low-carbon businesses.

TotalEnergies said investments would reach between $12 and $13 billion in 2021, with half of that earmarked for growth projects, including a major chunk in renewable energy and electricity.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Weeks before Archegos collapsed,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) received what would turn out to be one of its final warnings from a junior analyst about the hedge fund's impending disaster. Just as with earlier red flags, stretching back years, it was ignored.
""Try and act soon,"" the risk analyst told a colleague in the department dealing with investment fund Archegos, warning that the fund was vulnerable to liquidation, exposing Credit Suisse.
""If there is an issue, all brokers would be looking to exit simultaneously,"" he cautioned, a prediction that turned into reality less than two months later when the fund unravelled and lumbered Credit Suisse (CS) with a $5.5 billion loss.
The episode is one in a series of failures detailed in a report commissioned by the bank that offers an unprecedented glimpse into dysfunctional workings of one of the globe's largest banks to the wealthy.
The Swiss bank suffered by far the most of all peers from financing the fund's risky market bets, after its bankers won the upper hand over ""junior"" risk controllers, overriding safety limits and leverage controls, and leaving it unguarded when disaster struck.
The report is unusual because its publication represents a rare mea culpa from an institution that closely guards the secrets of its clients. 
Its criticism is frank, blaming management failure, a focus on maximizing short-term profits and enabling of Archegos’s ""voracious risk-taking"" for failing to steer the bank away from catastrophe. 
Despite long-running discussions about Archegos, by far its largest hedge-fund client, Credit Suisse's top management were apparently unaware, with the group's chief risk officer and investment bank chief recalling hearing of it first on the eve of its collapse.
""There were numerous warning signals,"" the report said. ""Yet the business ... failed to heed these signs.""
The report examines the bank's relationship, spanning almost two decades, with Bill Hwang, the banker behind Archegos, and his chequered history. Hwang could not immediately be reached for comment.
It is part of a wider drive by new chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio to reform the culture of the bank, after a series of previous scandals from spying on executives to its entanglement with doomed supply chain finance specialist Greensill - a key associate of CS whose near coincidental failure represented a disastrous double whammy.
BANNED FROM TRADING 
In 2012, Hwang settled insider trading allegations with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and pleaded guilty to wire fraud with the U.S. Department of Justice, the report said. His fund, Tiger Asia, rebranded as Archegos.
Two years later, Hwang and Archegos were banned from trading in Hong Kong, the report noted. Credit Suisse did not cut its ties. Instead, it shifted its trading focus to the United States.
The report describes the bank's risk assessments following these episodes, as ""perfunctory"", while its bankers ""shrugged off the settlements, guilty plea, and trading ban as isolated, one-time events"".
In the years that followed, Archegos broke many of the safety limits and internal controls set by Credit Suisse. But rather than paring back its backing, bankers ramped up support.
Despite generating modest profit - the bank reaped $16 million in revenue in 2020 - Archegos went on to build up a portfolio with Credit Suisse totalling nearly $24 billion. 
The 165-page report highlights deep-seated structural flaws, where a depleted risk department, with junior staff and outdated technology unable to challenge bankers driving the business.
It relays the damning assessment of another of the bank's analysts monitoring Archegos risks, who criticised the New York risk department.
""The team is run by a salesperson learning the role from people ... he did not trust to have a backbone,"" it said, without naming those involved.
Despite flashing red lights in the weeks ahead of its collapse, the bank reimbursed $2.4 billion of ""excess margin"" or surplus funds to Archegos, believing it was legally obliged to do so under its financing terms.
The crisis came to a head during the week of March 22, when Archegos’s single largest bet - on ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) - dropped sharply, and another,  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME), plummeted 20%.

Archegos admitted to Credit Suisse that it had run short of liquidity. That evening, the bank's investment bank chief and group risk officer, both of whom have since left, were informed. Neither could be reached for comment.
""No one at CS ... appeared to fully appreciate the serious risks,"" the report said. ""These risks were not hidden. They were in plain sight. When CS finally took steps ... the actions ... (were) too little, and too late.""

The National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales declined 1.9% from May, according to data released Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for no change.
The report shows that prospective buyers remain challenged by a depressed number of listings and soaring asking prices. At the same time, the group’s measure remains above its pre-pandemic level, suggesting underlying demand remains firm.
“The moderate slowdown in sales is largely due to the huge spike in home prices,” Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the NAR, said in a statement. “Buyers are still interested and want to own a home, but record-high home prices are causing some to retreat.”
Digging Deeper
A separate report last week showed that sales of previously owned U.S. homes, based on contract closings, rose for the first time in five months as inventories improved slightly.

(Reuters) - A group of banks and investors overseeing the shift of trillions of dollars to the new benchmark U.S. interest rate SOFR said on Thursday that they are recommending the use of the CME Group’s term SOFR rates in a move that should boost the move away from Libor.
“This formal recommendation of SOFR Term Rates is an achievement for the USD LIBOR transition specifically and for financial stability overall,” said Tom Wipf, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) chairman and vice chairman of institutional securities at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), in a statement. “Market participants now have all the tools they need as we enter the transition’s homestretch.”
Investors are facing a year-end deadline to stop basing new loans and trades on Libor, the London Interbank Offered Rate, which is being phased out due to concerns about the amount of derivatives using the rate, which in many cases is based on assumptions about their borrowing costs and not actual trades.
Libor also lost credibility when it was revealed that large banks manipulated the rate before and during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
The CME offers one-month, three-month and six-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) reference rates. Many companies and investors have sought a forward-looking rate term in order to lock in or hedge future interest rate exposures.
The ARRC said it recommends the use of the term rates for business loans and to hedge cash products but not for derivatives markets.

The shift away from Libor will require more than $200 trillion in trades and loans to move to new benchmarks, with SOFR expected to take the majority of the volume.
SOFR is based on around $1 trillion in daily loans in the U.S. overnight repurchase agreement (repo) market. The ARRC selected SOFR to replace Libor in 2017.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 10:03AM ET</span>",Foreign funds now own 81% of all shares listed on Moscow Exchange -bourse,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Global foreign funds increased their holdings of Russian stocks to more than 80% of all shares trading on the Moscow Exchange in the first half of this year, the bourse said on Thursday, attracted by higher dividend yields than in other emerging markets.
U.S. sanctions and increased debt issuance to fight the coronavirus crisis pushed foreign investors' share of Russia's OFZ treasury bonds to its lowest since 2015 earlier this year, but stocks have largely escaped the same fate, buoyed by rising oil prices in 2021.
Foreign funds held 80.7% of shares freely floated on the stock market as of July 1, the Moscow Exchange's head of primary markets, Natalia Loginova, told media during a webinar. That was up from 65.6% in 2020, but slightly below 83.3% in 2019.
Loginova said investors from the United States and Canada accounted for 54% of the total, with 22% from the United Kingdom and 21% from the rest of Europe. 
""We are talking about non-residents - large, global, institutional investors,"" Loginova said, putting the foreign fund inflows down to the outperformance of the MSCI Russia index this year and relatively high dividend yields offered by many Russian companies. 
The Moscow Exchange estimates dividend yields in Russia at the end of the year will reach 7.9%, higher than in other major emerging markets, such as Turkey, estimated at 5.1%, South Africa at 4.7% and China at 2.4%.

Russia has seen a flurry of initial and secondary public offerings since online retailer Ozon made a strong debut on the U.S. Nasdaq late last year, with depositary receipts trading in Moscow. 
The central bank is preparing to simplify the regulatory environment and remove obstacles to incentivise IPOs, it said earlier this month, and the bourse is expecting more than 10 IPOs or SPOs by the end of 2021.

""We have a good IPO pipeline, the central bank's measures are contributing to it, plus Ozon's success story is attracting new issuers,"" Loginova said.

The company said Milton resigned from Nikola on September 20 last year and has not been involved in its operations or communications since that time.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher again on Thursday as a big miss in second-quarter gross domestic product bolstered expectations of continued liquidity support from the Federal Reserve. 
A rebound in Chinese stocks overnight also helped the tone, after Chinese market regulators held a call with major banks and investors in an effort to reassure them that the measures taken against online tutoring companies earlier this week are an exceptional case.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 200 points, or 0.6%, at 35,131 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up by 0.2%
The Nasdaq's underperformance was in part due to a 2.9% drop by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock after it warned late on Wednesday of a slowdown in advertising revenue later this year. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)and Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock also weighed, with the payments company falling 5.1% after reporting fewer new users than hoped for in the second quarter. Uber fell 3.9% after news that Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) is selling down its stake.
Earlier, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said the U.S. economy had grown at an annualized rate of 'only' 6.5% in the second quarter, well below expectations for a rise of 8.5% and only a slight acceleration from 6.4% in the first quarter. Additionally, there was fresh evidence of the labor market recovery struggling, with the total number of people claiming unemployment benefits rising by more than 500,000 to over 13.15 million. Initial jobless claims, which are one week fresher, stayed stuck at 400,000, instead of falling to 380,000 as expected. 
Among the big gainers were  Didi Global ADR  (NYSE:DIDI), which rose 11% after The Wall Street Journal reported that its backers are preparing to take the ride-hailing company private again in an attempt to appease Chinese regulators. These had advised Didi against listing in New York before a review of its data policies was complete.
Zoom Video stock was another conspicuous winner after a number of surveys suggesting that more people than expected will continue working from home, at least partially, even after the pandemic. Various companies have already softened their stance on bringing workers back into the office full time as the Delta variant of Covid-19 has driven a surge in case numbers across the U.S. Other big gainers included Ford Motor (NYSE:F), whose second-quarter earnings late on Wednesday topped expectations, and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) stock, which rose after the card company profited from a revival of leisure travel in the quarter. 
Elsewhere, Workhorse stock rose 4.0% after it said it will part ways with CEO Duane Hughes. The maker of electric delivery trucks had had a wild ride through the 'Meme Stock' frenzy, before falling out of fashion after losing a key tender from the U.S. Postal Service. Also in the electric vehicles space, former Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) CEO Trevor Milton was indicted for making false and misleading statements. Nikola stock fell 9%.
Thursday is the first day of trading on Nasdaq for Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) stock, which was priced at $38, the bottom end of the marketing range for its IPO, on Wednesday. The after-hours session is likely to be dominated by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s second-quarter earnings.

Business jet traffic has rebounded from COVID-19 pandemic lows more quickly than commercial flights in the United States, helped by wealthy leisure travelers and some would-be first time flyers avoiding airlines.
Textron (NYSE:TXT) expects to get back to production levels similar to 2019 by 2022. General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) said on Wednesday it would make more of its Gulfstream jets.
While Textron Chief Executive Scott Donnelly told analysts the higher demand ""seems to be quite sustainable"", the maker of Cessna business jets is facing labor and supply chain challenges as factories struggle to meet surging orders.
""While we've experienced continued strong retail demand for our products, we have been impacted by our supply chain's ability to fully meet this demand, and we continue to work through these production challenges,"" Donnelly said.
He said Textron is bringing workers back to support growing production but echoed critics in suggesting hiring was a challenge due to expanded U.S. unemployment benefits. 
""I think hiring will get easier as the year goes on, we get off some of these unemployment programs that are frankly, creating huge disincentives for people not to work,"" Donnelly said.
The company said it expects 2021 adjusted earnings of $3.00 to $3.20 per share, compared to its previous forecast of $2.80 to $3.
Textron's aviation unit delivered 44 jets, higher than the 23 a year earlier, and 33 commercial turboprops, up from 15 in 2020.
Sales in its aviation unit rose 55.4% to $1.16 billion in the second quarter.
Excluding items, the company earned 81 cents per share, above analyst estimates of 65 cents, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue rose 29% to $3.19 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $2.97 billion, according to Refinitv data.
Textron shares were indicated 1.3% at $70 ahead of opening.

The bank cited a disproportionately high index representation by tech and privately owned companies for its adjustment of views on MSCI China to ""market-weight"" from ""overweight"".
Chinese shares recovered some ground on Thursday after a rout this week in the wake of Beijing's sweeping regulatory actions that hit firms in the $120 billion private tutoring sector and technology behemoths.
Goldman Sachs reiterated its overweight stance on Chinese A shares for their favourable sensitivity to potential fiscal policy easing in the second half of the year, higher index weights in areas where policy support could be strong, and still-robust buying potential.
""Recent regulations have signalled that the Chinese authorities are prioritising social fairness/stability over the capital markets in areas that are deemed public goods or important to strategic policy goals,"" Goldman analysts said in a note.
Chinese tech companies or privately owned companies were currently trading on attractive valuations, the bank said.
The bank said the sell-off since February was a major correction, as per its classification of more than 20%, approaching the scale of the pullback of 2018, where local regulation and shadow banking tightening along with U.S.-China trade tensions led to a 33% correction in MSCI China.

""'Uninvestable' has featured in many of our recent conversations with clients regarding investing in Chinese stocks but we would be hard-pressed to extrapolate the rather extreme regulations such as non-profit orientation and capital raising restrictions to the whole equity universe,"" the analysts said.

The company shifted to upward bias in the forecast for shipments of 5G handsets that host its chips. 5G handset shipments in 2021 are predicted to come between 450 million and 500 million.
While much of the world is yet to experience 5G services, manufacturers are already making devices that can run on those signals. Consumers, already exposed to fast 4G services, are also willing to shift ahead of the launch of those services.
The company makes money from designing and making chips and also licensing its technologies to other equipment manufacturers in exchange for royalties.
The company’s optimistic outlook was borne out of the 63% jump in its third-quarter revenue to $8 billion. All the business lines of the company clocked healthy growth with a 43% rise in revenue from licensing being the lowest.
Revenue from handsets, the money spinner for the company, grew 57%. The company also grew its business making chips for modems and wifi equipment as demand for those devices boomed in pandemic times.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Rights group Liberty Shared has asked U.S. customs authorities to investigate the Malaysian operations of U.S. firm Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co over accusations of abusive labour practices, the group told Reuters.
The Hong Kong-based anti-trafficking group said its June petition to U.S. customs, based on lawsuits and police reports by migrant workers, was probably the first such effort against a subsidiary of an U.S.-owned company in southeast Asia. 
""The conditions and treatment they have endured seem to satisfy the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) forced labour indicators,"" the group's managing director, Duncan Jepson, said in its first comments to media on the issue.
The ILO said it is concerned by the allegations at Goodyear Malaysia but is unable to validate them, as it works at the policy and sectoral levels. 
Goodyear, one of the world's largest tyre makers, said it was not aware of any petition on the matter. 
Malaysia, which employs millions of foreign workers, has faced growing accusations of exploitative labour practices, and received the worst ranking this month in an annual U.S. report on human trafficking.
Similar petitions to U.S. customs, including one last year by Liberty Shared regarding Malaysian palm oil producer Sime Darby Plantation, have led the United States to block imports over suspected use of forced labour. 
Goodyear's Malaysian unit was asked by an industrial court to pay back wages to migrant workers and comply with a collective pact, after dozens of foreign workers sued over unpaid wages and unlawful overtime, Reuters reported in May.
It has challenged two verdicts in the High Court. 
In its response to the rights group's comments, Goodyear added that it had strong policies to protect human rights.
""We take seriously any allegations of improper behaviour and are committed to ensuring that our business practices and those of our associates, operations and supply chain adhere to all applicable legal requirements and the requirements in our policies,"" a spokesperson said in an email. 
In the past, the company has declined to comment on the workers' accusations, citing the court process. 
Malaysia's largest fund manager, Permodalan Nasional Berhad, which owns 49% of Goodyear Malaysia, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it does not comment on whether specific entities are being investigated.
Jepson said he understood U.S. customs was pursuing the petition he filed. In an email, the CBP told him it had received the petition on forced labour conditions and was reviewing the information. Reuters reviewed the email. 
The July 19 email does not name Goodyear Malaysia, but Jepson said the petition was only about the company, based on civil cases and police reports filed by its workers. 
Last year, after Liberty Shared accused Sime Darby of forced and child labour, the CBP blocked its products from entering the United States. 

Sime Darby has appointed auditors to evaluate its practices and said it would engage with the CBP to address the concerns.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said on Thursday it is proposing acquiring a minority stake in budget carrier JetSMART in South America as part of a tie-up aimed at fueling growth in the region as demand recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Texas-based American, the largest U.S. operator of flights to South America, did not disclose the size, price or timing of the proposed investment in private-equity-owned JetSMART, which operates primarily from Chile and Argentina.
The proposal follows an abrupt end to American's partnership with Chilean-based LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ) when rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) launched a surprise acquisition of a 20% stake for $1.9 billion in 2019, forcing American's search for a new partner.
""This proposed investment in JetSMART would give customers access to the largest network, lowest fares, and best travel loyalty program in the Americas,” said Vasu Raja, American’s chief revenue officer.
The deal would help JetSMART expand its ultra-low-cost business model across South America and enable American to grow its long-haul network thanks to wider connecting options in the region.
""By connecting and growing our respective networks, and maintaining our distinct business models, we see a compelling value proposition,"" said JetSMART Chief Executive Estuardo Ortiz.
Passengers who fly on JetSMART within South America would be able to earn miles with American's loyalty program.
American inked a similar deal with New York-based budget carrier JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) last year and does not rule out deals with other ultra-low-cost business models.

""There's a lot about this partnership that can scale,"" Raja told journalists, while adding, ""But we need to walk before we can run.""

1337,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 08:27AM ET</span>",Big Oil Shows Confidence That the Era of Large Profits Is Back,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s largest oil and gas companies showed confidence that the era of big profits is back by significantly boosting returns to shareholders.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc surprised investors on Thursday with a dividend hike of almost 40% and $2 billion of share buybacks. TotalEnergies SE didn’t manage quite that level of shock and awe, but promised to divert as much as 40% of its surplus cash to stock repurchases.
This marks a major turnaround for the industry, which is trying to persuade investors to stick with it despite mounting concerns about climate change. Until recently, both companies were focused on paying down debt and strengthening their balance sheets in the aftermath of the oil slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
What’s changed is a broad rally in commodity prices, in which the surge in crude has been matched or exceeded by natural gas, metals and other bulk raw materials. It’s not just Shell and Total returning money to shareholders, almost every natural resources group from Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Plc to  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc is either raising dividends or buying back shares.
“We wanted to signal to the market the confidence that we have in cash flows,” Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said on a conference call. In the oil market “supply is going to be constrained and demand is actually quite strong.”
Shell and TotalEnergies both reported big surges in adjusted net income and cash flow for the second quarter, taking the figures back to pre-pandemic levels. That had been largely expected by analysts, but the big improvement in shareholder returns caught them by surprise.
”We knew Shell was set to raise distributions today, but the scale of the increase is significantly above expectations,” Redburn analyst Stuart Joyner said in a note.
Shell has some catching up to do. Last year, it cut its dividend by two-thirds during the depths of the Covid-19 lockdowns. Modest increases to the payout since then did little to boost the company’s appeal, with its market value today still more than a third below pre-pandemic levels despite a full recovery in oil prices.
TotalEnergies, which entered the Covid-19 crisis with less debt and maintained its payout throughout the downturn, has fared better with investors. Its buyback could amount to about $1.8 billion a year, if Brent crude remains near $74 a barrel, according to a note from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)
Other European oil majors are taking a similar approach. BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) have already made incremental dividend increases and announced more modest buyback plans.
Wooing investors has seldom been more important for Big Oil. The industry is under increasing pressure to turn away from fossil fuels and embrace clean energy as the world grapples with the evident dangers of a warming planet. Most of the European majors have laid out broad plans to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century, but there are questions about how much it will cost and whether profits from renewable energy can match oil and gas.
These doubts have weighed on the industry’s valuation, which overall is still 22% below its level at the end of 2019, said Banco Santander SA (NYSE:SAN) analyst Jason Kenney. A period of strong profits and cash flow will make it much easier for these companies to make the transition to clean energy while keeping investors on board.
“The climate crisis requires significant investment to truly shift to low and no carbon energy,” Kenney said. “But there is a huge wall of cash on the horizon from integrated energy companies in the second half of 2021 and certainly by 2022. And financial frames look credible and attractive at current levels.”

With Americans stepping out more after vaccinations and the relaxation of lockdowns, demand has rebounded for on-the-go consumables and refreshments after a year of weak sales.
Sales at Hershey's mainstay North America business rose 12.3% in the second quarter as consumers munched on SkinnyPop popcorn and gluten-free snack Pirate's Booty.
The company also reported a 70.2% surge in overseas market sales, marking a revival in a business that suffered last year due to coronavirus restrictions and the pandemic's impact on consumer spending. 
Overall, net sales jumped nearly 17% to $1.99 billion, exceeding the average analyst estimate of $1.84 billion.
The U.S. chocolatier said it expected 2021 net sales to rise between 6% and 8%, compared with a prior forecast of 4% to 6% growth. Analysts expected annual sales to be up nearly 6%, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

But Hershey maintained its annual adjusted profit outlook of $6.79 to $6.92 per share, citing higher supply chain costs.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.47 per share in the quarter ended July 4, beating expectations of $1.43 per share.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italian fashion group Prada (OTC:PRDSY) sees sales rising further in the second half of the year after revenues beat market expectations in the first six months, extending a recovery from the worst of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Milan-based, Hong Kong-listed luxury group said on Thursday total revenues jumped by 66% at constant exchange rates to total 1.5 billion euros ($1.78 billion), a touch under their first half 2019 pre-pandemic levels, but above 1.43 billion euros sales expected by analysts according to a consensus by Refinitiv.
""The sales momentum will stay strong in the second half of the year"", Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli said, adding the group will hold a capital markets day in the autumn.
The global health emergency last year interrupted two years of sales recovery at Prada, the result of a revamp plan focused on boosting e-commerce and sticking to full-price sales. 
Like the rest of the luxury sector, the group started to see the first signs of a rebound last summer after the key Chinese market eased anti-contagion restrictions. 
The industry is now steaming ahead as lockdowns have been relaxed around the world, with several key players well above their 2019 revenue levels. 
Sales from Prada's store network totalled 1.281 billion euros, 8% above their level in the first six months in 2019, even through a sixth of shops were still closed during that period. There was a ""strong acceleration"" in the second quarter, the company said.
Both Asia and the Americas exceeded pre-pandemic levels, while revenues in Europe - where shops remained closed for longer - were still 29% lower than two years ago. 
""Once stores re-opened, (sales) partially recovered"", Prada said, adding robust demand from local customers partially offset the lack of tourists in the region.
E-commerce grew by 100% or more compared with a year earlier. Online sales now accounts for 7% of retail revenues.
A policy of full-price sales together with strict cost controls led to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) turning positive at 166 million euros, compared with a coronavirus-driven loss of 196 million euros last year. 

This compared with an analysts consensus of 143 million euros and with and with a 150-million euro operating profit in the first half of 2019.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 08:11AM ET</span>",Airbus challenges Boeing cargo dominance with A350 freighter,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -Europe's Airbus took aim at one of Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s most profitable strongholds on Thursday with plans for a freighter version of its A350 passenger jet, gambling that a pandemic boom in Internet shopping will outlast the global health crisis.
Boeing has for years dominated air freight corridors with its windowless cargo planes, even as its European rival grabbed its crown as the world's largest maker of passenger jets. 
Airbus said its board had backed an A350 freighter to enter service in 2025, but did not announce customers.
""We believe we have a very promising aircraft,"" Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said after unveiling better-than-expected half-year results.
Plans to challenge Boeing's control of the freight market, maintained for decades through its 767, 777 and 747 cargo jets, were first reported by Reuters in March.
The move is seen as certain to trigger a response after Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun on Wednesday listed developments including, ""I hope in the relatively near term"", a freighter version of the 777X.
The 777X is set to be the world's largest twin-engined passenger jet but its development has been delayed by tightening safety certification standards and weak passenger demand. 
The head of Qatar Airways told Reuters last month Boeing was already showing designs for a 777X freighter.
Airbus has for months been informally canvassing support for an A350 freighter to be added to the smaller A330 freighter, whose sales have failed to keep up with the mid-sized 767 workhorse. 
FREIGHTER PREMIUM
Airbus hopes the arrival of the world's first lightweight carbon-fibre freighter will provide an opening as tougher emission standards, restricting deliveries of existing 767 and 777 freighters, enter force in 2028.
Boeing is expected to argue that its larger 777X freighter will be more integrated with existing infrastructure.
Calhoun also said on Wednesday exemptions may be allowed for deliveries of current freighters that result in 40% lower emissions compared to the planes they replace.
Thursday's announcement formally begins a race to sign up buyers ranging from express and logistics firms like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS to freight-minded Asian airlines or dedicated cargo carriers led by Luxembourg's Cargolux.
At stake is Boeing's dominance of a lucrative but volatile corner of the jet market in which freighters can fetch higher prices than passenger equivalents, according to market sources.
""We are closer every day, but we are not at the point where we can announce commercial transactions,"" Faury said.
Reflecting an economy in transition, the jet's design must juggle the needs of e-commerce leaders like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), who put a premium on the space available for their relatively light but bulky packages, to heavy-duty shippers hungry for more payload.
Industry sources said the A350 freighter would carry 109 tonnes compared with the projected 115-117 tonne capacity of the 777X version, though Boeing has yet to finalise any plans.
New freighters could support depressed output of wide-bodied jets pending a pick-up in international passenger travel.
About half of global cargo by value travels by air, and in turn half of that usually goes in the belly of passenger planes.
During the pandemic, many airlines have been forced to park unused passenger jets, driving up demand for cargo space on dedicated freighters at a time when e-commerce has been a lifeline for many during COVID lockdowns.

Economists warn the trends could start to unravel as the pandemic eases, but Faury said he was not worried about missing a wave of anticipated cargo replacements later this decade.
Boeing last year predicted demand for 2,430 freighters over 20 years, including 930 purpose-built cargo planes and 1,500 converted from passenger airplanes.

1343,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 08:06AM ET</span>",Airbus ups forecasts after big H1 but cautious on virus,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -Europe's Airbus doubled its full-year profit forecast and raised the outlook for jet deliveries after posting better-than-expected half-year results, pushing its shares to the highest level since the start of the coronavirus crisis.
The world's largest planemaker said it was benefiting from the beginnings of a recovery in air travel demand, but cautioned that uneven global vaccination rates and the spreading Delta variant of COVID-19 left uncertainty over the recovery.
Airbus said it expected to deliver 600 aircraft in 2021, up from a previous target of at least 566, and doubled its forecast for operating income to 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) while predicting 2 billion euros of free cashflow.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Airbus would deliver more than 600 jets this year after negotiating workarounds with cash-strapped airlines, including deals that allow some to delay accounting for new planes on their balance sheets.
""COVID-19 is not over,"" Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told reporters on Thursday.
""Levels of vaccinations are very diverse around the world and we cannot exclude that after the Delta variant there will be another one, so we believe we have to remain very prudent,"" he said, adding: ""It is going to a bumpy road in terms of recovery.""
Even so, shares in the Paris-listed heavyweight rose as much as 4.9%, helping to propel European shares to record highs. 
Stifel analyst Harry Breach said the stronger outlook reflected a growing share of high-margin A321neo jets in deliveries as well as the depth of cost cuts at Airbus, which is completing pandemic-related plans to reduce up to 15,000 jobs.
Led by its commercial aerospace and helicopter divisions, Airbus swung to an operating profit of 2.01 billion euros in the second quarter, compared with a loss of 1.23 billion a year earlier, as revenue rose 70% to 14.18 billion euros.
For the first half, Airbus posted operating earnings of 2.70 billion euros, eclipsing its previous full-year goal.
Analysts were on average expecting 1.59 billion euros of operating profit on revenue of 14 billion euros in the second quarter, according to a company-compiled consensus.
Its rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) on Wednesday posted its first quarterly profit in almost two years as revived domestic travel fuelled 737 MAX deliveries. Its shares rose 5%.
Both planemakers face concerns about the slow recovery of long-haul travel. A pickup is badly needed to revive demand for wide-bodied jets that was sagging even before the crisis.
Airbus announced the launch of an A350 freighter in a bid to break Boeing's longstanding dominance of a lucrative but volatile part of the jet market, which has benefited from growth in e-commerce during the pandemic. 

It has not yet secured orders for the new plane, which it expects to deliver to the first customer in 2025.

Investing.com – Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock was trading 4% higher in Thursday’s premarket as the company raised its forecast for annual profit while promising to move to build-to-order manufacturing to improve profitability.
The maker of Mustang SUVs and F-150 pickup trucks now expects its 2021 adjusted EBIT to be higher by about $3.5 billion, and total between $9 billion and $10 billion. Revenue in the second quarter rose 38% to $26.75 billion, although net profit halved to $553 million.
The company navigated the crippling chip shortage in the second quarter by focusing on higher-margin vehicles and reducing discounts.
Similar factors helped German rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to raise its operating margin forecast for the second time in quick succession on Thursday. The world's second-largest automotive group behind Toyota now expects an operating margin of between 6% and 7.5%, some 50 basis points higher than its last estimate. 
Shortages of silicon chips, in particular, have held back production at all major carmakers so far this year, with Ford alone falling some 700,000 short of plan due to unscheduled plant closures. Various chipmakers, notably Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, have said they expect the supply of chips to the sector to improve in the second half of the year.

1345,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 08:01AM ET</span>","From Facebook to Twitter, Big Tech sees social commerce driving sales growth","By Sheila Dang and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Led by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), social media platforms from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube to  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and Twitter are investing heavily in shopping features to drive revenue growth, a major theme that emerged during second-quarter results over the past week.
The companies are vying for a piece of the so-called social commerce industry, which relies on users' ability to discover and buy products through social media apps and is expected to balloon to $50 billion from $36 billion in annual sales by 2023 in the United States according to research firm eMarketer.
The success of social commerce stems in part from product targeting based on user interests, with sales generating more data that can be used for future advertising and merchandise placements.
Facebook, widely considered the leader in social commerce, and Google helped retailers bring in sales in the last quarter, with ecommerce player Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) saying the growth rate of products sold through the two tech companies' platforms was ""several times that"" of websites run by the merchants themselves.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that enabling commerce and making it easier for businesses to communicate with customers through its Messenger and WhatsApp apps was ""the right long-term bet.""
Retailers are increasingly hopping on to the trend as COVID-19 restrictions weigh on brick-and-mortar sales.
Brands ranging from luxury fashion house Burberry to fast fashion giant H&M have signed up celebrities and influencers to get millions of their followers to make purchases off ephemeral stories or posts by asking them to ""swipe up to purchase"".
While the business is small for now, the social media giants are eyeing the data generated from users' shopping and browsing habits for targeted advertising.
The scramble for user data has become even more crucial as recent privacy changes from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) limit tech companies' ability to track iPhone users and serve personalized advertising, ad experts have said.
THE FUTURE OF COMMERCE?
Facebook launched Shops in May 2020 during the height of the pandemic, luring brands with an easy way to sell items directly through Facebook and Instagram and consumers with a curated and personalized way to discover trendy clothes or home goods.
Facebook was the top social commerce platform according to a survey conducted by eMarketer in June 2020, with 18% of respondents saying they had purchased a product via Facebook. That compared with 11% for Facebook-owned Instagram and 3% for Pinterest (NYSE:PINS).
(Graphics: US social commerce buyers: https://graphics.reuters.com/FACEBOOK-COMMERCE/zgvomwadovd/chart_eikon.jpg)
Even as restrictions lift, analysts say the demand for shopping online is unlikely to retreat.
""People have gotten accustomed to buying online,"" said Edward Jones analyst Dave Heger. ""I don't think that they're going to go completely back to the level they were at before in terms of purchasing at brick and mortar stores.""
Snap Inc is investing in augmented reality technology designed to help users virtually try on items like watches, jewelry and other apparel to cut down on returns, a major problem faced by online retailers.
Snapchat users can take a photo of a friend's outfit with the app and find similar looks or product recommendations, Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said last week during the company's earnings conference call.
""The holy grail of advertising is to actually sell merchandise,"" said Rich Greenfield, a partner at LightShed Partners, in a note on Snap last week.
""While these initiatives are still in the early stages, we believe an increasing number of brands want to be associated with where commerce is headed.""
Popular short-form video app TikTok is testing live-streamed shopping with select brands in the UK, allowing viewers purchase clothes as an influencer models the item in real time during a live video.

Twitter, a platform most known for following breaking news or current events, said on Wednesday that it will begin testing a shopping feature that lets users browse items for sale at the top of a brand's profile page.
Streaming video site YouTube, known for ""unboxing"" videos in which YouTubers review toys or tech gadgets, wants to integrate shopping directly into the platform, said Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler on Alphabet's earnings call on Tuesday.

1347,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>",Robinhood Prices IPO at Bottom of Marketed Range,"(Bloomberg) --  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) will start trading later on Thursday after pricing its initial public offering at the low end of its range, in what was a muted start for one of the year’s most highly anticipated listings.
The price indicates investors weren’t clamoring to buy Robinhood’s stock the way they had with some of the year’s hottest offerings. Still, a weaker price in the IPO could allow more room for the “first-day pop” craved by investors when the stock opens.
A big pop out of the gate could benefit the Robinhood users that took advantage of the company’s move to open up its IPO to retail investors. It reserved up to 35% of its IPO for its customers.
The pricing seems to have spooked at least one other large IPO that had been in investor meetings. Car battery maker Clarios International Inc., pulled its $1.8 billion listing after the Robinhood pricing late Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported.
Robinhood was still the seventh-biggest IPO on a U.S. exchange this year. The trading app company and some of its investors sold 55 million shares Wednesday for $38 each to raise $2.1 billion, according to a statement. Shares of the company at the center of this year’s meme stock frenzy had been offered for $38 to $42 each.
The company has a market value at the IPO price of just under $32 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings. Accounting for employee stock options and similar holdings, Robinhood’s fully diluted value would be closer to $33 billion. That falls short of the $36 billion that it would have had at the top end of its price range.

Busy Summer
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are leading the IPO. The shares set to trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol HOOD.
It joins a busy summer for IPOs. Listings since Jan. 1 have already reached an all-time record with 688 companies raising a combined total of more than $228 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
As a publicly traded brokerage, Robinhood will join the ranks of  Coinbase Global  Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), a cryptocurrency trading platform that debuted this year and is currently worth $50 billion, and industry heavyweight  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp., which bought competitor TD Ameritrade last year and has a market value of $128 billion.
Robinhood’s co-founders, Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev and Chief Creative Officer Baiju Bhatt, will together control most of the shareholder voting power in the company, according to its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Index Ventures, NEA
The company’s top shareholders are venture firms DST Global, Index Ventures, New Enterprise Associates and Ribbit Capital. Each group owns more than 5% of its stock leading into the offering.
Salesforce Ventures, the investment arm of Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM)., had expressed interest in purchasing up to $150 million of the shares at the IPO price, according to Robinhood’s filings.
Robinhood caught on during the coronavirus pandemic as homebound young people turned to online trading to pass the time and make money. Its monthly active users have more than doubled in the past year, with 17.7 million as of the first quarter, up from 8.6 million in the same period in 2020.
The Menlo Park, California-based company had said it would reserve 20% to 35% of its Class A shares for its customers.
‘Gamification’
Robinhood’s increased popularity has led to scrutiny from politicians and regulators, who are focused on the so-called gamification of trading and its role in the meme-stock phenomenon. At the height of the volatile late January frenzy over stocks like  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME)., the company had to raise billions of dollars from its backers.
It disclosed its financials for the first time in its July 1 public filing, which showed the company generated net income of $7.45 million on net revenue of $959 million in 2020, compared with a loss of $107 million on $278 million the previous year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Anheuser-Busch InBev underwhelmed on second-quarter profit on Thursday as costs increased even though the world's largest brewer drove revenues to above pre-pandemic levels.
The brewer reported lower core profits in its two biggest markets, the United States and Brazil, as cans and distribution became more expensive and a weaker Brazilian real bit.
AB InBev retained its forecast that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) would grow by between 8% and 12% this year, with revenue increasing at a faster pace.
In the second quarter, that profit figure rose 31% on a like-for-like basis to $4.85 billion, against expectations for a 35% increase, according to a company-compiled poll. 
Analysts at Citi said core profit missed estimates, and the lack of upgrade to the forecast was another negative.
AB InBev shares were down 6.0% at 54.62 euros at 1100 GMT, placing them among the weakest performers in the FTSEurofirst300 index of leading European shares and meaning they are now also lower in the year to date.
The company said its outlook reflected its current assessment of the scale and magnitude of the pandemic and could be subject to change.
CAN CHALLENGE
In a clear sign that the pandemic and related restrictions are not over, South Africa instituted a new alcohol sales ban for four weeks from late June and ongoing curbs in South Korea led to lower beer sales there.
The pandemic has also led to a surge in demand for cans, pushing up their price, given restrictions on bars, where bottles and kegs are the norm.
""We had to import a lot of cans from several different markets, cans from Mexico, cans from China, cans from Europe and India in order to serve the high demand,"" chief executive Michel Doukeris told Reuters in a telephone interview, referring to the U.S. market.
Transportation costs have also increased, both due to higher prices and distance travelled. In Brazil, returnable bottles used in bars are closer at hand, available in every brewery, while cans have further to travel.
Doukeris, the former North America zone head who took over as chief executive from fellow Brazilian Carlos Brito on July 1, said revenue in the April-June period was 3.2% higher than in the same period of 2019.
A year on from its worst quarter of the COVID-19 crisis, the brewer of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona did benefit from increased beer consumption across the Americas, in Europe and South Africa, including a leap of more than 50% in Colombia. 

Only in China, which moved out of its coronavirus lockdown earlier in 2020, were beer volumes lower.
The world's second largest brewer, Heineken (OTC:HEINY), reports its first-half results on Monday, with global number three Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) on Aug. 18.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>","Credit Suisse CEO expects wrap-up of FINMA 'Spygate' query, Archegos just warming up","ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) expects Swiss watchdog FINMA's proceedings over the bank's 2019 spying scandal to wrap up soon, Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein said on Thursday, while its discussions with the supervisor on the more recent Archegos scandal has only just begun.
""(In terms of) discussions around Archegos, Greensill and the Spygate topic (with FINMA): we understand that Spygate (proceedings) should be concluded very soon,"" Gottstein told journalists on a call following the bank's results.
""In terms of Archegos, we have just started now the discussions and interviews,"" he said.

""As you probably know, it's not only the Swiss regulator but also the U.S. and U.K. regulator who are looking into this, and it's not only with Credit Suisse. There were a handful of other prime brokers that we understand are being approached and will be part of that regulatory investigation.""
The bank is also in the process of conducting interviews with regulators on the Greensill matter, Gottstein said, adding he could not comment on the timing of the conclusion of regulatory probes into either the Greensill or Archegos matters.

1353,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",Factbox-Key points of Credit Suisse Archegos post-mortem,"(Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) released a review on Thursday into what led the bank to lose $5.5 billion in its dealings with investment fund Archegos, as the bank reported a near-80% fall in second-quarter profit.
The frank 165-page report by law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison found the losses were the result of a ""fundamental failure of management and controls"" in the bank's prime brokerage unit and investment bank. 
Credit Suisse said in response it would continue to remediate the shortcomings identified and put ""risk management at the heart of its decision-making processes"". 
Representatives for Archegos have not responded to requests for comment. 
Here are details from the report, which can be found here https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/archegos-info-kit.html
ARCHEGOS RELATIONSHIP WITH CREDIT SUISSE
Credit Suisse's relationship with Archegos head Bill Hwang began in 2003 through his Tiger Asia fund. 
In 2012, Tiger Asia and Hwang settled insider trading allegations with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2014, Hwang and Archegos were banned from trading securities in Hong Kong for four years.
Credit Suisse continued to do business with Archegos both during and after these criminal and regulatory matters, the report said. 
Credit Suisse conducted two reputational risk reviews of Archegos, but the first did not begin until ""years"" after the SEC and DOJ resolutions. 
In 2015, a routine compliance review of Archegos picked up negative news about Hwang, which led Prime Services to subject Archegos to a reputational risk review. 
""That process was largely perfunctory"", the report said. 
When the Hong Kong trading ban was lifted in 2018, prime services sought permission to restart trading with Archegos in Asia, which resulted in a second reputational risk review that largely mirrored the first. Trading in Hong Kong restarted. 
ARCHEGOS RISK MANAGEMENT 2012-2019
Credit Suisse's risk management internal credit rating of Archegos improved several rungs between 2012 and 2016 due to the fund's increasing net asset value (NAV), which grew from $500 million in 2012 to $3.9 billion in 2016. 
In 2019 Archegos asked Credit Suisse to materially lower its swap margin requirements, from around a 15-25% initial margin. Credit Suisse agreed to a new standard swap margin rate of 7.5% in May 2019.
This led Archegos to ""significantly increase its swap exposure with Credit Suisse"". 
In November 2019, an annual credit review of Archegos recommended maintaining its BB- rating and more than doubling the fund's risk limit, despite a 40% decline in its net asset value. 
BUILD UP OF RISK IN 2020
Over the course of 2020, Archegos's risk profile increased ""significantly"". 
""Archegos began regularly breaching its stress scenario limits,"" the report said. 
""Rather than call additional margin, as was its contractual right, Credit Suisse attempted to re-balance Archegos's portfolio by requiring that it add market shorts""
By Sept. 1, 2020, Archegos's overall holdings at Credit Suisse had risen to $9.5 billion, more than 75% of which was long.
Archegos began regularly breaching its risk limits with Credit Suisse in the spring of 2020. By April 2020, Archegos's ""potential exposure"" was more than 10 times its $20 million limit.
Meanwhile, the value of Archegos' investments fell from approximately $3.5 billion in February to $2 billion in April, triggering an option for Credit Suisse to terminate its swaps portfolio. 
Prime Services did not terminate the portfolio, but risk management asked the business to confirm its comfort with Archegos's existing margin levels. 
The business responded that it ""remain(ed) comfortable with the existing margin framework"". 
By July 16, 2020, Archegos had over $600 million in ""net scenario exposure"" — more than 240% of its limit. Within a week, on July 22, 2020, Archegos's net exposure had jumped to $828 million.
""From that point on, Archegos remained in breach of its scenario limits virtually every week until its March 2021 default"", the report said. 
By the end of December, the concentration and liquidity risk of Archegos's portfolio had substantially increased. 
RED FLAGS RAISED
In around September 2020, a risk management analyst covering Archegos raised concerns to his supervisor about Archegos. 
He said the team in New York was not ""adequately staffed to be reliable"". 
The analyst and his supervisor agreed that the prime services risk (PSR) unit was not adequately managing Archegos portfolio risk. But when they followed up again with PSR, they were told that progress was being made.
FINAL MONTHS
In January 2021 Archegos's internal credit rating at Credit Suisse was downgraded from BB- to B+, due to an increase in how long it was estimated it would take to liquidate its positions.
Archegos's risk limit breaches continued to grow. The bank asked Archegos for $750 million in additional margin in February 2021. Archegos posted $500 million. 
The bank also came up with a new margin proposal for Archegos, which would have required it post more money. 
On Feb. 23 they contacted Archegos to discuss it. 
""The written proposal was sent to Archegos the next day
but Archegos ignored it despite repeated follow ups from Credit Suisse"". 
The bank continued to chase Archegos on the dynamic margin proposal; the business scheduled three follow-up calls in the five business days before Archegos's default, all of which Archegos cancelled at the last minute. 
During the weeks that Archegos was ""considering"" this proposal, it began calling the ""excess variation margin"" it had historically maintained with Credit Suisse. 
Between March 11 and March 19, and despite the fact that the
margining proposal sent to Archegos was being ignored, Credit Suisse paid Archegos a total of $2.4 billion — all of which was approved by risk managers. 
From March 12 through March 26, the date of Archegos’s default, Prime Financing permitted Archegos to execute $1.48 billion of additional net long trades. 
ARCHEGOS COLLAPSE
During the week of March 22nd, the value of Archegos's positions fell. Its single largest position, ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC), dropped 6.7% on March 22 and continued to fall in the days that followed. 
On March 23, Archegos had over $600 million of excess margin remaining at Credit Suisse but that excess margin was wiped out by market movements and Archegos owed Credit Suisse more than $175 million by the next day, which Archegos paid. 
On March 24, another of Archegos's significant positions,  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME), fell 20%. 
Credit Suisse determined it would be making a $2.7 billion call for variation margin the next day. 
The matter was escalated to the co-heads of Prime
Services and the head of equities, who scheduled a call with Archegos for that evening to inform it of the upcoming margin call. Archegos told Credit Suisse it could not meet either Credit Suisse's or any of its other prime brokers' margin calls on the following day. 
That evening, Credit Suisse's investment bank chief executive and group chief risk officer were informed; it was the first time either recalled hearing about Archegos.
On the morning of March 25, 2021, Credit Suisse issued two margin calls that totalled more than $2.8 billion.
Archegos reiterated that its cash reserves had been exhausted by margin calls from other prime brokers earlier in the week. 
On the morning of March 26, Credit Suisse delivered an Event of Default notice to Archegos and began unwinding its

Archegos positions. 
Credit Suisse lost approximately $5.5 billion as a result of Archegos’s default and resulting unwinding of positions.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 07:31AM ET</span>",Northrop lifts outlook as countries ramp up space exploration,"By Mike Stone
(Reuters) -Defense contractor  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) raised its full-year forecast on Thursday and beat quarterly estimates, propped up by high demand at its fast-growing space unit.
The company's space systems unit reported a 34% jump in quarterly sales, as countries ramp up investment in space exploration and satellite based sensors. Earlier this month, Northrop won a contract worth $935 million to develop living quarters for NASA's planned outpost in the lunar orbit.
Fresh support for the defense industry came last week when the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate's Armed Services Committee rolled out a draft of its 2022 defense budget which boosted spending by $25 billion, potentially benefiting defense companies including Northrop, and signaling defense spending could rise under President Joe Biden.
The United States is modernizing its military in an effort to deter Russia and China, which is likely to boost the company's balance sheet.
Analysts say Northrop's B-21 bomber and GBSD intercontinental ballistic missiles are likely to be the backbone for the company's growth over the next decade.
Northrop now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share between $24.40 and $24.80, up from its prior range of $24 and $24.50.

The Virginia-based company expects full-year sales to be between $35.8 billion and $36.2 billion, above its previous forecast of $35.3 billion and $35.7 billion.
Adjusted net earnings of $6.42 per share beat analysts' estimate of $5.84 in the second quarter ended June 30. Total sales of $9.15 billion also toppled estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>",Beyond the meme: finance gets serious on going viral,"By Anna Irrera
LONDON (Reuters) - Ian Rogers (NYSE:ROG) used to be in charge of digital strategy for luxury fashion group LVMH. Now he has a new mission: to sprinkle some aspirational glitz on to French cryptocurrency company Ledger.
Rogers' new role, to transform Ledger into a consumer brand with viral potential, shows how young consumer finance companies are not only embracing the latest social media channels but also choosing executives and marketing strategies more often associated with lifestyle brands.
""The Ledger product is designed well: it has the best and most thoughtful security,"" said Rogers, who started his career as webmaster for the Beastie Boys' website and later became chief executive of headphone maker Beats.
""What it doesn't have is a go to market approach that feels like it was done by  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). That's what we need to do.""
Fintechs are using celebrity investors, social media influencers and flashy campaigns to make online checking accounts and loans a little more glamorous and get the attention of potential customers.
""When Nike drops a new sneaker or when Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) launches a new product that's interesting, but when we add an alternative payment method that is not interesting to consumers,"" said David Sandstrom, chief marketing officer at Stockholm based Klarna.
""If we can partner with strong influencers we can grasp the attention of audiences whose attention is very hard to grasp.""
Buy-now-pay-later company Klarna, which has just bought influencer marketing software firm APPRL, has been one of the most prominent pioneers of the strategy.
It launched campaigns with hip hop star Snoop Dogg, and most recently partnered with rapper A$AP Rocky who became a shareholder and ""CEO for a day.""
In a June ad that got 4.8 million YouTube views, A$AP Rocky wanders the streets in a purple robe and slippers, until he finds a phone with the Klarna app and uses it to buy clothes to regain his ""pre-lockdown"" look.
IRRESPONSIBLE?
But making financial products go viral in a heavily regulated industry is tricky.
In December, Britain's advertising watchdog banned a Klarna Instagram influencer campaign for ""irresponsibly"" encouraging customers to use ""buy now, pay later"" services. 
""Brands need to remember finance is a regulated industry, so beyond the essentials such as requiring influencers to tell consumers they are being paid to say X or Y, they need to consider the regulatory framework,"" said Sarah Kocianski, head of research at fintech consultancy 11:FS.
Klarna's Sandstrom said the company was working to inform financial and advertising regulators in more detail about its products and services.
In June, Klarna and a group of experts in influencer marketing and psychology, issued a white paper outlining best practices for influencers and brands to advertise online responsibly. 
Some social media companies have also become stricter about what financial products can be promoted on their platforms and how. In May, TikTok updated its branded content policy to prohibit promotion of financial services and products by influencers globally. 
But financial brands are still allowed by TikTok to contract influencers to appear in their ads. 
The majority of Gen Z use Instagram and TikTok to seek information on personal finance, based on a study by Qualtrics commissioned by personal finance fintech Credit Karma.
""When it comes to finances, sometimes things are more well received when they're coming from your friends and peers than from your parents,"" said Charli D'Amelio, the 17-year-old American influencer, with more than 120 million TikTok followers. 
D'Amelio, an investor in teen banking app Step which she has promoted on social media, said she sticks to products she uses and likes. Step is also backed by Will Smith's venture capital firm Dreamers VC, Justin Timberlake, plus athletes Eli Manning and Stephen Curry. 
""Financial services used to just be where your paycheck went and you went to the branch to get cash or to deposit a check,"" said Step CEO CJ MacDonald. ""Now it's part of your every day, paying bills, receiving money from friends. It really becomes part of your lifestyle, we are just leaning into that."" 
FINDING THE KEY TO GEN Z
For larger fintechs these new strategies may be a way to capture younger audiences after gaining market share in other demographics.
Oakland-based Credit Karma, which has grown from a free credit score provider to offering financial products including checking accounts, says it has signed up one in two U.S. millennials. 
Credit Karma is now looking to reach Gen Z - the 18-25 age group. As part of this push it has teamed up with video streaming platform Vevo to sponsor a series of live performances by artists with a strong Gen Z fan base, including Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande. The company also recently engaged with influencers on TikTok. 
""Just like we have done with millennials, we want to meet Gen Z where they are,"" said Poulomi Damani, general manager of assets and tax at Credit Karma. ""This is an area that we really want to own outright, and an area you will see us doubling down on.""
Mainstream banks and finance companies have started to follow the trend with mixed results.
British bank NatWest worked with influencers to post social media content promoting its digital banking app Bo' in late 2019, but then scrapped Bo' after a sluggish start.
The big question is whether cool celebrity backers can help young fintechs win the battle against the established players, whose customers may prefer to stick with the traditional bank they already have a relationship with. 
""If you can break through on a lifestyle brand and people believe they are part of a community you can charge more,"" said Mike Abbott, global banking lead at Accenture (NYSE:ACN). ""But to the extent these strategies are effective (against incumbents), time will tell. Convenience trumps influence every time."" 
U.S. banks created peer-to-peer payment app Zelle after PayPal's mobile payments business Venmo took off in the United States as a way for people to send money to each other.
Zelle now processes more payments than Venmo. Users sent $307 billion via Zelle in 2020, compared with $159 billion sent through Venmo. 
As they mature, some fintech companies have shifted towards a more conventional marketing approach.
British payments company Wise tried shock tactics in its early days, with anti-bank ads and flash mobs across the City of London.
Since then it has become more understated. 

""You might remember us running naked outside the Bank of England to expose hidden fees for our 'Nothing to Hide' campaign,"" said Cian Weeresinghe, chief marketing officer at Wise, which went public earlier this month.
""People still talk about that today which is great. But it's only natural that the way we market grows as we do.""

Rising vaccination rates, reopening economies and pent-up travel demand are expected to help hotel operators like Hilton and Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc reach occupancy rates similar to pre-pandemic levels in the coming quarters.
""While the pace of recovery varies by region, we expect continued strength in leisure demand and further upticks in business travel to drive continued resurgence in the back half of the year"", Chief Executive Officer Christopher Nassetta said.

Occupancy rate for the company's U.S. region rose to 63.7% in the quarter as domestic leisure travel continues to steer the demand recovery.
The company reported net income attributable to Hilton stockholders of $130 million, or 46 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, compared to a net loss of $430 million, or $1.55 per share, a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, Hilton earned $0.56 per share, beating analysts estimates of $0.40 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 07:07AM ET</span>",German airline Condor to acquire Airbus A330neo jets,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -German leisure airline Condor is acquiring 16 Airbus A330neo jets to replace a wide-bodied fleet of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 767 aircraft, accounting for almost half of a backlog of planes whose debt-strapped buyers were unable to take delivery.
""The first aircraft is expected in autumn 2022, whilst the replacement of the entire long-haul fleet is scheduled to be completed by mid-2024,"" Condor said on its website.
Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told reporters seven of the jets would be supplied directly by the planemaker, with the rest to be provided by leasing companies.
The deal was announced late on Wednesday, a day after EU regulators approved 525.3-million euros ($619.3 million) in German aid for Condor that will help it restructure after an earlier decision was annulled by a European court..
Condor has a mixed fleet of planes from Airbus and Boeing, but relies solely on its ageing 767s for long-haul needs.
The A330neo is an upgraded version of the A330 passenger plane with recent Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) engines. Its closest competitor in typical airline competitions is seen as the 787-10 variant of the newer Boeing 787 Dreamliner family.
The Condor deal provides homes for A330neo jets earmarked for airlines whose finances have worsened during the pandemic. 
That means they are likely to have been sold at a steeper than usual discounts, industry sources said, mirroring recent moves by Boeing to find homes for some unsold 737 MAX jets.
Three of the seven so-called ""white tail"" jets, or unsold A330neos left without the livery of a purchasing airline, were originally allocated to Indonesia's Garuda and four to AirAsia X of Malaysia.

Airbus declined comment on terms of the deal.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Airbus was also in talks to replace Boeing jets at another European leisure carrier, British airline and holiday group Jet2.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse's Archegos post mortem slams management; profit slumps,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -A ""lackadaisical"" attitude towards risk and ""a lack of accountability"" were to blame for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s $5.5 billion loss on investment fund Archegos, according to a review published on Thursday, as the bank reported a near-80% fall in second-quarter profit.
The collapse of Archegos rocked Wall Street in March as its highly leveraged stock bets went sour, sending banks scrambling for the exit. In a $10 billion bloodbath, Credit Suisse was the biggest loser, a devastating double whammy for a bank already reeling from the insolvency of a key associate, Greensill Capital.
Archegos is still hitting Credit Suisse's bottom line. Net profit of 253 million Swiss francs ($278.45 million) missed average forecasts for 334 million Swiss francs as it absorbed an additional $653 million loss from the fund's collapse and amid a general slump in trading.
In a damning assessment of what went wrong, an independent review unveiled along with the results on Thursday repeatedly criticized the bank's risk management practices, though it did add there was no evidence of fraudulent or illegal activity. 
""The Archegos-related losses sustained by Credit Suisse (CS) are the result of a fundamental failure of management and controls in CS's Investment Bank and, specifically, in its Prime Services business. The business was focused on maximizing short-term profits and failed to rein in and, indeed, enabled Archegos's voracious risk-taking,"" the 165-page review by law firm Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrisson said.
(To read the report, click https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/archegos-info-kit.html )
The bank said in response that it would ""put risk management at the heart of our decision-making processes"".
Shares of the bank pared early losses to trade down 2.4% by 1045 GMT, taking their losses to 22% so far this year. The European bank index rose 1.8% and is up about 24% year to date.
Analysts had expected a nearly 600 million franc hole caused by more losses at Archegos and further weakness in the bank's trading and advisory businesses to bring second-quarter net profit down to a quarter of its value a year ago.
Excluding Archegos and other significant items, Credit Suisse said pre-tax income would have dropped 11%.
Credit Suisse said action has been taken against 23 staff over Archegos, with nine fired and a total of $70 million in monetary penalties taken from all of them.
Under new Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio, it is trying to turn the page after a swathe of investigations, executive changes, and divisional reshuffles. Management is promising to unveil a strategic overhaul by year-end.
An exodus of senior dealmakers and traders from its investment bank, and plans to reduce risk in its prime brokerage unit, have made the changes especially felt within that division.
The bank said on Thursday that a provisional capital buffer for Archegos has been removed, but a buffer for Greensill remained. It said it was in advanced talks with some creditors to recover some of the $10 billion of client investments linked to Greensill.
It also said it had been accruing for dividends during the quarter but the size of the payout had yet to be determined.
""Management provided some reassurance on the call suggesting this quarter's focus was on dealing with the fall-out of Archegos and Greensill, but we could potentially return to a more 'business as usual' quarter as early as 3Q21,"" Citi analyst Andrew Coombs wrote in a note.
LEADING WEALTH MANAGER WITH A CULTURE PROBLEM
Investors have been waiting to see whether troubles at Credit Suisse, which have also left clients in its asset management business directly exposed to potential Greensill losses, have affected prized relationships with the ultra-wealthy.
Credit Suisse on Thursday reported 7.3 billion francs in net asset outflows from its wealth management businesses, an indicator of a loss in business from rich clients, for the second quarter.
Chief Financial Officer David Mathers told journalists on a call that 4.2 billion francs of the outflows were related to its efforts to limit its risk in Asia.
""Operationally, CS has been able to meet expectations on the whole,"" ZKB analysts said in a note, adding the headline profit miss was related largely to legal and restructuring provisions.
""However, net new money is showing signs of slowing down with outflows of 4.7 billion francs,"" the analysts said, referring to the group-wide figure which includes flows for businesses outside wealth management. 
Earlier this week, Credit Suisse appointed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) partner David Wildermuth as its new chief risk officer, as it seeks to turn the corner on recent scandals.
REVENUES FALL
A 41% fall in investment banking revenues showed the broader impact of the scandals to be slightly more pronounced than analysts anticipated, as its capital markets business posted a nearly 10% decline on an un-adjusted basis and its advisory revenues fell 37% ""due to timing of deal closings"". That combined with the $653 million Archegos hit pushed investment banking to a pre-tax loss. 
On the trading side, adjusted revenues from equity sales and trading fell 17% decline excluding Archegos. Fixed income sales and trading dropped 33%.
Trading revenues also fell at major U.S. and European banks in the second quarter compared to 2020 when unprecedented market volatility during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic helped drive record volumes. 
Credit Suisse has said it wants to pare back its prime brokerage unit, which conducts business with hedge funds and was responsible for the Archegos ties.

The downcast earnings marked a notable contrast to the sunny outlook presented on the same day by Lloyds (LON:LLOY), which until April had been run by Credit Suisse's new chairman. Nearer rivals, including UBS and Julius Baer, have also put Credit Suisse's misfortune in stark relief, as frothy markets and high client activity levels have continued to help private bankers generate higher earnings off the rich.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 07:01AM ET</span>",Spirits maker Diageo's sales exceed estimates on strong U.S. demand,"By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) -Spirits group  Diageo  (LON:DGE) reported on Thursday a better-than-expected rise in full-year organic net sales growth, as North American bars and restaurants reopened helping boost demand for its tequila brands and Johnnie Walker whisky.
The London-listed company's results mirrored bumper earnings from a host of companies, including carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and plane maker Airbus, and reflected a generally buoyant mood among European firms emerging from the coronavirus pandemic. [L8N2P53G2]
Diageo, whose shares reversed early losses to trade up 2% on the FTSE 100, also raised its annual dividend by 5% to 44.59 pence per share.
The company said results were propelled by the United States, its biggest market, where easing lockdowns had driven replenishment of stocks at bars and restaurants.
At the same time, consumers continued to shop for more premium spirits such as tequila, liqueurs and bottles of Johnnie Walker scotch at supermarket stores, driving organic net sales in North America up 20%.
In the European region, Turkey and Northern Europe were the strongest performers helped by strong demand for scotch whiskies in shops. 
Signs of resurgence were also emerging in Africa, Latin America and Asia, where organic net sales rose by double digit percentages, in part due to easier comparisons to last year. 
Total organic net sales rose 16% for the year ending June 30, beating the 13.7% rise analysts had expected, according to company-supplied estimates.
""It comes as no surprise that the shuttering of bars and night clubs left Diageo with a nasty hangover of problems,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""However, the strength of the group's brands means it was able to recoup some of its losses through a huge increase in supermarket trade in some key markets, and it has come out of the pandemic in remarkably resilient shape.""

Diageo said it expected organic net sales momentum to continue into fiscal 2022, but with volatility in the short term.
Lavanya Chandrashekar, who was promoted to chief financial officer in July, told reporters volatility was coming from lockdowns in markets such as India, South Africa and Indonesia, where there has been a rise in COVID-19 cases in recent months.

1363,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 06:59AM ET</span>",Dow Futures 145 Pts Higher After Powell's Comments; Facebook Disappoints,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely higher Thursday, helped by a dovish tone from Fed Chair Jerome Powell after the U.S. central bank’s latest policy-setting meeting and an improvement in sentiment toward Chinese assets overnight. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 145 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures underperformed, dropping 25 points, or 0.2%.
The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady, as expected, at its latest policy-setting meeting on Wednesday, adding that economic progress had been made toward the point where it would begin reducing its monthly bond purchases. 
However, Powell also cautioned that despite this progress the economy still has a long way to go before the central bank would actually adjust its policies, referencing in particular the need for further recovery in the labor market. 
With this in mind, investors will keep an eye on the weekly initial jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), for signs of another improvement in this key metric. Additionally, looking at the broader economy, the second-quarter GDP release is due at the same time, and is expected to show annualized growth of 8.5%, some of the fastest growth seen since the end of World War II - albeit the habit of annualizing growth figures, which amplifies any change in the economy, has generated numbers that are a poor reflection of reality in recent quarters.
The second-quarter earnings season continues, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock slumping 4% premarket after the social media giant warned late Wednesday that it expects revenue growth to ""decelerate significantly"". The stock had rallied hard in expectation, after strong updates from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP).
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock fell 4.9% premarket after the online payments system’s revenue growth missed expectations, while Ford (NYSE:F) stock soared over 4% after the auto giant reported a surprise profit in the second quarter, thanks to surging prices for scarce models.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) tops the bill of companies reporting Thursday, after the close, while updates are also due from the likes of Merck (NYSE:MRK), Altria (NYSE:MO), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and  Hilton Worldwide  (NYSE:HLT), among others.
Also of interest will be Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI), which surged 16% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Chinese ride-hailing company’s biggest backers could take it private in order to placate Chinese regulators, only weeks after its IPO in New York.
Elsewhere, oil prices rose Thursday, climbing to two-week highs, helped by U.S. crude supplies falling to their lowest level since January 2020, resuming their downward trend after last week’s surprise build.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, showed that crude inventories dropped by just over 4 million barrels during the week to July 23. 
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $72.52 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $74.04.
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.2% to $1,821.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1873.

Investing.com – Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock was down more than 3% in Thursday’s premarket trading after the company warned of revenue growth slowing down significantly in the ongoing third and next quarter.
Social media and online platforms have had a scorching run last one year as pandemic-struck users logged on like never before, not just to share their personal lives, but also to watch content and shop while staying home due to fear of stepping out in public. That dynamic is widely expected to weaken as economies reopen and people return to work and life as usual.
“We expect year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth,” Facebook chief financial officer David Wehne said in a release announcing its second-quarter results.
Wehne spoke of more challenges coming Facebook’s way, most notably the recent update to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) privacy policy which makes it tougher for apps to track users and source their personal data for targeting them with their ads.
He said the iPhone-maker’s iOS updates will have a greater impact in the ongoing quarter than in the second quarter.
The comments outweighed the many positives the second-quarter numbers threw up including a 56% jump in advertising revenue and 7% rise in both daily and monthly active users at the social media giant.
Total revenue rose 56% to $29.07 billion, driven by companies turning more to digital platforms to sell their wares to individuals.
Diluted earnings per share more than doubled to $3.61 from $1.80, topping analysts’ expectation of $3.04.

1369,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 06:28AM ET</span>",Singapore Airlines first-quarter loss narrows on cargo demand boost,"(Reuters) -Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA) on Thursday posted a S$409 million ($302 million) first-quarter loss, narrower than a year earlier, helped by a strong air cargo market and no major impairments.
The airline forecast passenger capacity to reach 33% of pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter, and said it would serve at least 50% of locations it did before by the end of September. 
The airline, like Hong Kong rival Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd, lacks a domestic market and is solely reliant on international travel at a time when most borders remain closed.
SIA carried 132,600 passengers in the month of June, an improvement on its June 2020 figures but a 96% fall from the same month two years earlier, before the pandemic hit. 
It filled just 16.1% of seats in June, with its flights heavily reliant on cargo for revenue at a time when the freight market is strong.
The company posted a record S$1.1 billion loss in the first quarter a year earlier. 
Revenue in the just-ended quarter came in at S$1.30 billion, up from S$851 million a year earlier. 
Cargo flown revenue grew 32.4% and the company said demand fundamentals for the business remained strong, even though fresh pandemic-related restrictions in parts of the world could cause short-term uncertainty. 
SIA, unlike rival national carriers in Southeast Asia, still has a healthy cash balance to help it get through a period of low travel. It recently raised S$6.2 billion of convertible bonds underwritten by its largest shareholder, state investor Temasek Holdings.

The airline also said 98% of active pilots and cabin crew have been vaccinated.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China stepped up attempts to calm frayed investor nerves after a wild markets rout this week by telling foreign brokerages not to ""overinterpret"" its latest regulatory actions, setting the stage for a rebound in beaten-down stocks on Thursday.
Chinese state media also joined in to say yuan-denominated assets in China remained attractive and that short-term market panic did not represent long-term value.
China stocks had their best day in two months on Thursday. The blue-chip CSI300 Index jumped 1.9% and the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.5%, but for the week, the gauges are still down 4.7% and 3.9%, respectively. 
Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext jumped 5.3%, recouping nearly all of this week's savage losses.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended Thursday up 3.3%, shrinking this week's loss to 3.7%. The Hang Seng Tech Index, the target of a heavy sell-off earlier this week, surged 8%, but is still down 4.3% for the week. 
The gains came after the securities regulator on Wednesday night held a meeting with executives of top global investment banks with an aim to calm financial markets nerves, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The meeting added to official efforts to shore up investor confidence, which has been dented by Beijing's sweeping regulatory actions that hit firms in the $120 billion private tutoring sector and technology behemoths. 
""This is more to calm the market to isolate the education industry and not to overinterpret it,"" said one of the people, who has knowledge of the meeting held by China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) vice chairman Fang Xinghai.
At the meeting, Fang told the bankers that official policies would be rolled out more steadily to avoid sharp volatility in the markets, said another person, adding Fang also indicated the crackdown was not aimed at decoupling Sino-U.S. financial markets.
Executives from investment banks  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and UBS, among others, attended the meeting, said the people, who declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
The regulator only invited those foreign brokerages with existing licenses to operate in the country, said a separate person with knowledge of the meeting.
CSRC did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. Representatives at Credit Suisse, Goldman, JPMorgan, and UBS declined to comment. Bloomberg first reported the regulatory meeting on Wednesday.
""Recent events definitely have a negative impact on the global investor sentiment about China. So the risk is whether the long-term money will also pull out of China,"" said Wang Qi, CEO at fund manager MegaTrust Investment (HK).
""In terms of the foreign capital flows, whatever happened lately was mostly driven by hedge fund type hot money ... we welcome any Chinese government's moves to increase transparency and rebuild investor confidence."" 
'REGULATORY RISKS'
The CSRC meeting followed a brutal sell-off in shares of Chinese companies this week after investors were spooked by Beijing's rules that ban for-profit tutoring in core school subjects.
The new rules for the private education companies closely followed China's antimonopoly campaign against technology giants and new regulations for home-grown companies looking to list overseas. 
Qian Wang, Vanguard Group's Asia-Pacific chief economist, said that it's natural for global investors to be exposed to higher regulatory risks when it comes to investing in China.
""Although China is the world's second-biggest economy, it remains an emerging market with economic, policy and regulatory uncertainty,"" Wang said. If investors seek higher return, ""you need to bear higher risks, which is natural"", she said.
Beijing stepped up efforts to soothe investor nerves over the last couple of days amid concerns that a sharp sell-off in equities could have a spillover effect to other asset classes, including bonds and foreign exchange.

The state-backed China Daily said Beijing remained supportive of domestic companies seeking to list overseas and that regulators would soon unveil more measures to further open capital market to foreign entities.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's LG Chem Ltd on Thursday posted a four-fold surge in quarterly profit on pandemic-led demand for its chemicals used in making electronic products such as laptops and TVs, and said sales of batteries used in electric vehicles were improving.
The company's LG Energy Solution business, a supplier of batteries used in EVs made by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, has thrived on growing demand for such cars in Europe and the United States. But analysts have said a months-long chip shortage that hit global auto production has recently weighed on LG Chem's profit.
""We are seeing gradual increases in our cylindrical battery shipments and we expect to see continuous growth as the global EV demand continues to grow,"" Chief Financial Officer Cha Dong-seok said during an earnings briefing on Thursday. 
Recently, some executives at chipmakers and car companies have turned cautiously optimistic over a potential easing of the supply crunch in the second half of the year. 
Still others, such as Stellantis, said they expect the shortage to continue well into next year.
LG Chem, which is on track to hive off its battery business, said on an analyst call that it plans to secure EV battery production capacity of 430 gigawatt hours in 2025 that could power about 11.6 million EVs. It had earlier forecast capacity of 155 GW hours for end 2021.
Earlier on Thursday, LG Chem said it would set up a $1.1 billion joint venture with Hyundai Motor Group to build a battery cell plant in Indonesia.
The company, which gets nearly 60% of its operating profit from its chemicals business, said operating profit jumped to 2.2 trillion won ($1.92 billion) for the April-June period.
The latest quarterly profit included a settlement payment from rival SK Innovation Co Ltd worth 1 trillion won ($872.5 million), and a previously announced 400 billion won cost to replace batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) after fire risks were found.
The quarterly profit beat an average broker forecast of 1.2 trillion won, compiled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate. 

In April, SK Innovation said it would pay LG Chem nearly $2 billion to drop all litigation in a bitter trade secrets dispute that had threatened a plant in the U.S. state of Georgia which SK is building to supply Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY).

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) have asked India's Supreme Court to restrain the country's antitrust body from seeking sensitive business information in an e-commerce investigation, according to filings seen by Reuters.
The requests, in court documents which have not been made public, illustrate the level of concern at the two e-commerce giants over the investigation, which has prompted public spats between U.S. firms and the Indian government. 
In its investigation, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) sought a list of Amazon and Flipkart's top sellers, online discounts and pacts with smartphone makers, among 32 questions it asked on July 15, the documents showed. 
Flipkart told the Supreme Court the details sought reinforced its fear of the ""invasive nature"" of the investigation, and asked for both the information request and the overall investigation to be put on hold.
""The information sought...is sensitive in nature,"" Flipkart said in the court document. ""It is evident that the director-general is determined to take precipitative action,"" it added, referring to the watchdog's investigation chief.
Amazon made a similar request of the court, saying the watchdog had sought a ""wealth of sensitive information within a deadline as short as 15 days.""
Both firms said the investigation could affect their reputation and goodwill. The court is likely to take up the case in coming days. 
Flipkart, Amazon and the CCI did not respond to a request for comment.
Although India's trade minister and a southern court have said the companies should not shy away from inquiries, Amazon and Flipkart say the CCI lacked evidence and should not have launched the investigation last year.
The request to the Supreme Court comes after the state court dismissed the companies' pleas in June and July, saying the investigation must continue.
The antitrust body, which has set the companies a July 30 deadline to answer its queries, had plans to speed the investigation into Amazon and Flipkart after the clearance from the court, Reuters reported in June.
The CCI questions also sought details of policies on showcasing products on the websites of Flipkart and Amazon, and internal communication with sellers over sale events, the court documents showed.
The watchdog also asked for a list of the firm's top 100 sellers between 2015 to 2020 and top-selling products. For Amazon, specifically, the CCI sought copies of all agreements it has signed with two of its sellers, Cloudtail and Appario.
In February, a Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation based on Amazon documents showed it had given preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers, including Cloudtail and Appario, and used them to bypass Indian law.

Indian retailers say Amazon and Flipkart favour select sellers on their platforms, to the disadvantage of smaller players. 
The companies deny any wrongdoing.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Europe's largest carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) raised its profit margin target on Thursday for the second time in less than three months, pointing to record earnings in the first half of 2021 that topped even pre-pandemic levels.
Spurred by Chief Executive Herbert Diess' vision to overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the world's top electric vehicle (EV) player, Volkswagen has unveiled a string of targets and deals this year to meet that goal.
They include a bid for Europcar on Wednesday, valuing the car rental firm at 2.9 billion euros ($3.4 billion), in a bet on mobility services which Volkswagen sees as a major source of future profits.
""Yes, we did buy a car rental company, but it won't be a car rental company probably in 5 to 10 years' time. It can be a big mobility platform,"" Diess told journalists.
The 62-year old said he hadn't finished.
""Our electric offensive is picking up momentum and we will keep on increasing its pace in the months to come,"" he said.
Volkswagen said it now expected an operating return on sales of 6.0-7.5% this year, up from 5.5-7% previously, and nudged up its forecast for net cash flow at its automotive division, which is now expected to be much stronger than in 2020.
First-half operating profit before special items reached 11.4 billion euros, above the previous record of 10 billion euros achieved in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on the global economy.
The performance was driven in part by strong demand for high-margin luxury Porsches and Audis.
Porsche SE, Volkswagen's largest shareholder with a 31.4% stake, also raised it financial outlook following the carmaker's results, forecasting profit after tax of 3.4-4.9 billion euros in 2021.
Shares in Volkswagen, up a third so far this year, were flat at 0901 GMT.
The global car sector has been hit by a shortage of crucial semiconductors, with several rivals, including Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), BMW and GM, adjusting or halting production. Volkswagen accounted for that by trimming its forecast for deliveries to customers.
""The risk of bottlenecks and disruption in the supply of semiconductor components has intensified throughout the industry,"" it said.

It now expects deliveries to be up ""noticeably"" in 2021 from the 9.3 million last year, having previously expected them to rise ""significantly"". Volkswagen Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz said the new outlook roughly corresponded to a 10% increase.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>",Latest shift to tech leaves Cathie Wood's ARKK in the cold,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -A rebound in growth stocks over the last month is doing little to bolster the performance of Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF, which has lagged this year after outperforming all other U.S. equity funds in 2020. 
The $22.4 billion ARKK fund is down 7.1% for July so far, putting it in the bottom 96th percentile rank among the 605 mid-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar. At the same time, the S&P 500, with its heavy weighting in big technology-focused stocks, is up 2.4%, helped by a 5.8% gain in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and a nearly 12% gain in Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. The fund is down 2.5% this year, compared with a 17.1% gain for the S&P.
ARK Innovation's portfolio rallied amid last year’s economic lockdown thanks to bets on companies such as  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc and Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc.
This year, by contrast, kicked off with a powerful broad market rotation into value stocks that boosted shares of energy firms, banks and other companies expected to benefit from a vaccine-fueled economic rebound. 
While worries over slowing growth and a COVID-19 resurgence have partially reversed that shift, investors’ recent preference for big tech and growth stalwarts suggests that, for now, few expect a return to the broad economic lockdowns that boosted the companies in Wood’s portfolio in 2020, said Dave Mazza, managing director at Direxion. 
""People are finding comfort in the mega-cap names. While we might have seen peak economic growth there's not a sense that we're going to have a massive contraction in the economy"" from further restrictions on travel or school closures, he said. 
ARK did not respond to a request to comment for this story.
The United States leads the world in the daily average number of new infections, accounting for one in every nine cases reported worldwide each day. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Tuesday that Americans fully vaccinated against COVID-19 should go back to wearing masks in indoor public places in regions where the coronavirus is spreading rapidly. That has done little to boost the monthly performance of some of ARKK's constituents. Shares of Zoom are down 4.5% this month, though they have pared losses in recent days. Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)'s shares are down nearly 19% on concerns about slowing user growth rates. Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc - which make up nearly 10.5% of ARK Innovation's portfolio and are its largest holding - are down 4.8% for the month to date, while shares of cryptocurrency company Coinbase Global Inc are down nearly 5% as bitcoin remains more than 30% below its April highs. Overall, seven out of the fund's 10 largest positions are down for the month, with the 6% rally in  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) among its few winners. Despite ARK's losses, investors appear to be sticking with Cathie Wood. The ARK Innovation fund brought in slightly more than $521 million in new inflows during the week ended July 21, its largest weekly gain since June 23, according to Lipper data. 

At the same time, Wood earlier this month pared holdings of big Chinese companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Tencent and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com amid government crackdowns in the sector. That move has so far proven prescient - shares of Alibaba are down 13% for the month, while shares of Tencent are down nearly 24% over the same time.
""Investors who piled in to the long-term thematic ETF continue to stick with it despite continued underperformance in 2021 in hopes that 2020 success will be repeated,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of fund research at CFRA.

Investing.com –  Didi Global ADR  (NYSE:DIDI) soared by 34% in Thursday’s premarket trading after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company’s biggest backers could take it private in order to placate Chinese regulators, only weeks after angering them with an IPO in New York that they had advised against.
The regulators had responded to the listing by asking app stores like Alipay and WeChat to take the company off their platforms until a review of the company’s security framework was completed. That sent Didi's ADRs plummeting.
The ride-hailing giant had listed on the NYSE on June 30 and after briefly trading above the issue price of $14 slipped below it. It hit a low of $7.16 earlier this week before recovering somewhat.
A WSJ report said earlier this month that the regulator’s abrupt move was prompted by the company’s refusal to delay its initial public offering until a review of its data policies had been completed. 
The report comes only hours after details emerged of a call between the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission and a handful of major domestic and foreign banks and investment companies, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Blackrock (NYSE:BLK). Various reports suggested that the CSRC had tried to calm investors' fears about the safety of their investments, after a recent onslaught against the Educational Technology sector triggered panic selling across the broader market. 
The premarket move in Didi's ADRs implies that its backers would be willing to compensate U.S. investors who bought into the IPO more or less in full. The IPO had been priced at $14 per ADR.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 05:52AM ET</span>","Schroders' assets near $1 trillion, aided by low interest rates","By Muvija M
(Reuters) - Low interest rates are bolstering money managers like  Schroders  (LON:SDR), its chief executive said on Thursday as the British firm posted a jump in first-half profits and record high assets under management of 700.4 billion pounds ($977.7 billion). 
The low rate environment has been a major driver of flows into equities while competing assets of cash or fixed income were ""very unattractive"", CEO Peter Harrison told Reuters.
Robust investor sentiment amid trillions of dollars in government stimulus has also helped, with Schroders saying demand for its mutual funds and higher margin equity products increased.
""Savings rates are higher but many of the flows have also come from institutions, so I think the key driver will be interest rates remaining low and markets remaining stable,"" Harrison said. 
Schroders, which lifted its interim dividend by 6% to 37 pence a share, said pretax profit rose 33% to 373.9 million pounds ($521.03 million) for the six months ended June 30. It booked in net new business of 17.9 billion pounds.
The company said total assets under management climbed 6%, with strong demand for its higher margin equity-focused mutual funds, especially from clients in the United States and continental Europe, helped by rising markets.
Financial updates from three other asset managers this week also showed inflows running at billions of pounds.
However Harrison said he was mindful of the fact that markets had ""travelled up a long way"". 
""There is clearly lots of evidence, particularly in private markets of a bit of trough. It is not something that is keeping me awake a lot at night at the moment,"" he added.
Schroders also cautioned that if inflationary pressures persisted, or the recovery in economic growth disappointed, there could be increased market volatility which would impact its business. 
""There is a tug of war going on. On the one hand we have fears of inflation and on the other hand we have fears of growth slowing. Three weeks ago the world was talking about more inflation and now the world is more worried about too little growth,"" Harrison said.
""Somebody used the phrase goldilocks ... arguably we are in that place where it is neither one nor the other, and that is not too bad for financial markets.""
Separately, Schroders announced that Elizabeth Corley would be joining as a non-executive director, and that she would succeed Michael Dobson as its chairperson at the end of the company's shareholder meeting in April next year. 

Corley, currently a director at Pearson, BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), has previously headed Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors.

BERLIN/ZURICH (Reuters) -Lindt & Spruengli's gold foil-wrapped chocolate Easter bunny scored a legal win on Thursday as Germany's federal court ruled its gold tone had trademark protection.
The Swiss premium chocolate maker has been fighting many court battles over the years to protect one of its best-selling products that, according to the federal court, crossed German counters more than 500 million times in the past 30 years.
After failing to get comprehensive trademark protection for the shape of its sitting bunny, Lindt changed its tactics, trying to protect the shade of the foil instead, a strategy that seems to start bearing fruit.
Germany's federal court said the tone of the gold foil used to wrap its chocolate bunnies had trademark protection, citing market research presented by the company that showed that 70% of respondents associated the gold tone with the Lindt bunny.
A court in Munich had previously rejected Lindt's claims against German confiserie Heilemann, owned by Viba Sweets, that also sells a sitting bunny in golden foil. The appeals court will now have to reexamine the case.
Lindt & Spruengli said it did not intend to force another chocolate bunny manufacturer out of the market, but was defending itself against copycats exploiting the reputation it had built for its product over years. 

""There are many ways to design Easter bunnies that don't infringe Lindt & Spruengli's rights,"" said a spokesperson for the company that raised its full-year guidance after reporting strong Easter sales this week. 
Viba Sweets was not immediately available to comment.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Nestle said input cost inflation would slightly squeeze margins this year even as strong demand for coffee boosted organic sales in the first half, allowing the world's biggest food group to raise its full-year growth guidance.
Food groups are grappling with surging commodity costs that are hitting margins, and Nestle, with well-known brands like Nescafe coffee and Purina pet food, said price increases could only be implemented with a time lag.
Its underlying trading operating profit margin is expected to slip to around 17.5% this year from 17.7% in 2020, and then improve again from 2022, Nestle said in a statement on Thursday. 
""(On the margin), we're taking a bit more of a cautious view to the full year because we see continued inflation in the system,"" Chief Executive Mark Schneider told reporters on a call. He said the company could hedge against some increases -- such as coffee prices that spiked this week -- but not against higher transportation costs. 
""Inflation has been virtually absent for a number of years and then pointed up very sharply. It hit us directly,"" Schneider said, adding the problem was transitory. 
Schneider said input cost inflation was expected to reach around 4% this year and the company would accelerate price increases in the second half. He said Nestle needed to raise prices by about 2% to offset 4% cost inflation. It raised prices by 1.3% in the first half, and said a better product mix and efficiencies would also help. 
Peer Unilever (NYSE:UL) said last week it expected cost inflation to be in the high-teens in the second half of the year, while Danone also on Thursday reported a lower operating margin for the first half.
Shares in Nestle, up almost 10% so far this year, were 0.9% lower at 0721 GMT, outperforming a 1.1% weaker sector.
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said ""the market probably did not want to hear about a delay in passing through prices"", while the strong top line and increased growth guidance had been expected. 
Nestle raised its organic growth guidance for the year to 5-6%, versus ""above 3.6%"" previously, after strong demand for coffee and a rebound in the out-of-home business and in China lifted sales by 8.1% in the first half and 8.6% in the second quarter.
Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy noted ""strong sales growth in developed markets at 6.7%, compares with a flat outcome at Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and Unilever, demonstrating Nestle's innovation strength"".

Nestle confirmed it would deliver ""consistent mid-single-digit organic growth for years to come"".
Net profit rose slightly to 5.9 billion Swiss francs ($6.49 billion).

1381,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 05:39AM ET</span>","South Africa property, retail firms bet on townships despite unrest","By Nqobile Dludla
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Recent unrest in South Africa damaged hundreds of businesses but property developers and retailers say they remain committed to the fast-growing consumer markets of its predominantly Black townships.
Riots broke out this month after former President Jacob Zuma handed himself in to start a 15-month jail term for contempt of court.
More than 300 people died and about 3,000 stores were looted, over half of them belonging to major retailers and fast food brands.
At least 161 shopping malls, 11 warehouses and eight factories suffered heavy damage, sites that include tenants such as grocery chain Shoprite and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) majority-owned Massmart. 
The hardest hit areas included Durban's uMlazi and Johannesburg's Soweto and Alexandra townships in KwaZulu-Natal and the economic heartland of Gauteng. 
Graphic: South African stores looted and damaged during unrest - https://graphics.reuters.com/SAFRICA-ZUMA/RETAIL/zdpxoynrkvx/chart.png 
Exemplar REITail had five of its 27 malls damaged, including three which are expected to take up to four months to return to normal operations, CEO Jason McCormick (NYSE:MKC) told Reuters.
Yet McCormick said the company remained committed to not only repairs, but the development of another 30 malls in the pipeline. 
""What happened was tantamount to a black swan event. I don't think anyone ever foresaw the extent of this ever happening,"" McCormick said at one of the group's malls in Johannesburg.
McCormick's views reflected those expressed by six other CEOs and executives of listed property companies and two retailers interviewed by Reuters.
Vukile Property Fund, for example, will repair its damaged Daveyton Mall in Johannesburg, one of the first township malls, and will forge ahead with a 90 million rand ($6.1 million) upgrade of the site, CEO Laurence Rapp said. 
""It's one of our most successful malls in the portfolio in terms of all its trading densities and trading statistics,"" Rapp said, adding that the current book value of the six damaged properties is around 2.8-3 billion rand.
Real estate developers and retailers have spent the last two decades targeting rising consumer spending by the Black middle class in areas that were disadvantaged for decades under white minority rule.
For such communities, the benefits include jobs and the convenience of having shops nearby, eliminating the cost of travelling to other towns, and these developments in turn attract other retailers and services such as banks. 
Fraym, a U.S.-based company which analyses data on communities across the world, in 2019 identified South Africa's townships as the biggest and fastest-growing retail market over the previous 10 years.
Leon Kok, chief operating officer at Redefine Properties, the second-biggest listed property firm in South Africa, said the company was committed to maintaining its presence but opening new shopping centres at this point was unlikely, not due to the unrest but rather to the pandemic's impact on the economy. 
The companies said where security and risk mitigation measures are not strong enough to fight lawlessness, they ensure that they have adequate insurance cover to manage the risk.
COST OF DOING BUSINESS
Dipula Income Fund's damaged malls will take about four to eight months to rebuild at an estimated cost of 250-300 million rand, CEO Izak Petersen told Reuters. 
Arrowhead Properties' Montclair Mall in the port city of Durban will take three to six months to be up and running, with the damage estimated at 30-50 million rand, Chief Investment Officer Alon Kirkel told Reuters.
Although the scale of the looting and damage was unexpected, Ninety One Portfolio Manager Ann-Maree Tippoo said this type of unrest was already priced in and the risk return profile of these investments were reasonably well understood by property firms.
""So the commitment to these types of assets and areas will remain because the return profile is quite astounding compared to other retail assets,"" Tippoo told Reuters.
She noted the total return on township retail (including capital valuation changes) was 5.7% in 2020 versus minus 6.7% for suburban retail, citing data from the South African Property Owners Association.
Vukile's Rapp said: ""For us it's a cost of doing business in these areas but the returns are really, really good. So therefore you accept the cost, the risk, for the return."" 
Still, some players may delay further investment beyond repairing damage pending economic growth, cautioned Sasfin senior equity analyst Alec Abraham.

Many are still assessing the extent of the damage from the violence which began on July 9 and lasted until July 15.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Friday, helped by a series of positive corporate earnings after the Federal Reserve concluded its latest policy-setting meeting.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.8% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.5%.
The second-quarter corporate earnings season has been largely positive in Europe as companies benefit from the gradual removal of Covid restrictions as vaccination programs kicked in.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) stock rose over 3% after the oil major raised its dividend by almost 40% and said it will buy back $2 billion of shares, with its earnings boosted by stronger oil prices.
Airbus (PA:AIR) stock rose 3.9% after the world’s largest commercial planemaker sharply raised its forecasts for full-year deliveries and earnings,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) stock climbed 3.7% after the miner increased its stock buyback program by another $2 billion, and ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) stock rose 4.4% after the steelmaker boosted its guidance for global steel demand after its best quarter since 2008. 
Telecoms equipment maker Nokia (HE:NOKIA) also continued its rocket-like ascent, rising 7.1% after raising its profit forecast for the second time in quick succession.
On the flip side,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock dropped 3.9% after the Swiss banking giant posted a 78% fall in second-quarter net profit, hit by a sharp drop in its investment banking revenues. The bank also revealed that an independent external investigation into the Archegos scandal showed that it had failed “to effectively manage risk” but it had not been involved in any “fraudulent or illegal conduct”.  
European markets had received a positive handover from Asia after reports that Chinese authorities tried to calm market fears about a regulatory clampdown by calling banks and investors overnight. 
Additionally, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated in his press conference, following the conclusion of the U.S. central bank’s latest two-day policy meeting, that the U.S. economy still had to make substantial progress on jobs before any form of tapering. 
This dovish tone would also have provided some comfort for a market fretting about high levels of inflation and the potential of central banks dialing down monetary support.
In economic news, Germany's seasonally-adjusted jobless total fell by 91,000 in July, far more than expected and driving the unemployment rate down to 5.7%, its lowest in 14 months. 
German inflation data for July are due later in the session, but eyes will also be on the release of the minutes of last week's European Central Bank meeting.
Elsewhere, oil prices rose Thursday, helped by U.S. crude supplies falling to their lowest level since January 2020, resuming their downward trend after last week’s surprise build.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released late Wednesday, showed that crude inventories dropped by just over 4 million barrels during the week to July 23. 
These stocks rose for the first time in nine weeks the previous week, prompting concerns that demand was peaking in the world’s largest consumer. 
At 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $73.00 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.6% to $74.33.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,816.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1869.

1383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 03:45AM ET</span>",ArcelorMittal Boosts Steel Outlook as Profit Beats Estimates,"(Bloomberg) -- ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) SA boosted its guidance for global steel demand after a record-breaking price rally yielded the company’s best quarter since 2008.
The biggest steelmaker outside of China now expects 2021 steel demand -- a key barometer of economic growth -- to increase by 7.5% to 8.5% from last year. In May, the company projected demand to be at or above the upper end of its initial 4.5% to 5.5% forecast, following a contraction in 2020.
“Looking forward, we see the demand outlook further improving into the second half and have therefore upgraded our steel consumption forecasts for the year,” ArcelorMittal Chief Executive Officer Aditya Mittal said Thursday in a statement.
Steel has surged over the past 12 months, joining a wider commodities boom as producers struggled to meet an unexpectedly strong rebound in demand from the construction and manufacturing industries. That’s created optimism about the future of Europe’s steel industry after a decade of plant shutdowns and job cuts.
It’s also provided an opportunity for some significant shareholder returns. ArcelorMittal announced a new $2.2 billion share buyback program, in part funded by the sale of its U.S. operations in 2020, adding to the $2.8 billion returned to shareholders since September 2020.
“We assume that the magnitude of earnings improvement, and earnings surprise, of ArcelorMittal has once again exceeded peers’,” said Ingo Schachel, head of equity research at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY). “The strong cash conversion and consistent cash allocation is impressive.”
Supply curbs in China, producer of more than half the world’s steel, have raised hopes that overcapacity issues that have plagued Western steel producers may be less severe in the future. Russia, a major exporter to Europe, has also started taxing exports in an attempt to cool domestic prices.
Emissions Goals
Still, the steel business’s bumper profits and shareholder returns may not last. The industry -- responsible for about 7% of carbon emissions globally -- faces an expensive road to net-zero emissions.
ArcelorMittal set new emissions targets for 2030. That includes cutting carbon emissions by 25% across the group, while the goal for its European business was increased to 35%. That will cost an estimated $10 billion, the company said.
The steelmaker will seek government support for much of that figure. It recently signed an memorandum of understanding with the Spanish government to support half the cost of a $1 billion upgrade to create a green steel plant there.
Second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were $5.1 billion, ArcelorMittal said. That beat analysts’ estimates.
“The shares should be supported this morning but it will be interesting to see whether some profit taking occurs during the day, notably after the U.S. opening,” said Christian Georges, senior analyst at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA. “Many investors would have been expecting a beat today.”

The move comes more than a year after Shell slashed its dividend by two-thirds. Two modest increases to the payout since then did little to boost the company’s appeal, with its shares still about 40% lower than pre-pandemic levels despite a full recovery in oil prices.
The big increases to shareholder returns announced on Thursday show a concerted effort to restore the Anglo-Dutch company’s reputation as a cash machine for investors.
“We are stepping up our shareholder distributions today, increasing dividends and starting share buybacks,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a statement. “The quality of Shell’s operational and financial delivery and strengthened balance sheet have given the board confidence.”
Shell will pay a dividend of 24 cents a share for the second quarter, a 38% increase from 17.35 cents in the prior period. That’s still some way below the 47 cents a share the company paid out before the pandemic.
The increased payouts to shareholders follow in the footsteps of its European peers BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), but with buybacks on a much larger scale for 2021. The whole industry is boosting investor returns as it recovers from a historic downturn due to the coronavirus pandemic. TotalEnergies SE also said on Thursday that it will start repurchasing shares.
Shell’s second-quarter adjusted net income was $5.53 billion, compared with $638 million a year earlier. That was above the average estimate of $5.2 billion in a Bloomberg poll of 15 analysts.
Shell is proceeding with the buybacks after dropping its condition that net debt should fall below $65 billion before shareholder distributions increase. At the end of the second quarter, the company’s net debt was $65.7 billion.

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 02:21AM ET</span>",Robinhood's meme stock status fuels IPO uncertainty,"By Krystal Hu and Echo Wang
(Reuters) - Robinhood Markets Inc thrived thanks to the popularity of so-called meme stocks such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) with retail investors. Becoming a meme stock itself comes with trading volatility that is giving pause to some potential investors in its initial public offering.
The trading app's monthly active users surged from 11.7 million at the end of December to 21.3 million as of the end of June, as retail investors on social media sites such as Reddit speculated on stocks such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. 
In an unusual move, Robinhood has reserved between 20% and 35% of its IPO shares for retail investors who are users of its app. The IPO is expected to price later on Wednesday and raise about $2 billion. 
Robinhood has warned in its IPO registration that the participation of retail investors could trigger a rollercoaster ride in its shares that could prove too risky for those seeking long-term sustainable gains. 
A Reuters review of social media posts on sites such as Reddit and interviews with Robinhood customers showed that some retail investors were skeptical about the IPO's prospects. 
Among the reasons they cited were their assessment that Robinhood's pursuit of a $35 billion valuation was unrealistic, the risk of regulators cracking down on Robinhood's business, and the company's imposition of trading curbs when the meme stock trading frenzy flared up at the end of January.
""I had enjoyed Robinhood a lot, it sparked my interest in investing, it’s easy to use and straightforward. I just don’t trust them to do what's right for their customers the next time they find themselves in a hard spot,"" said machinist Zachary Wells, a Robinhood customer in Kansas City, Missouri, who has been trading on the app for more than a year.
A Robinhood spokesperson declined to comment.
Robinhood placed temporary restrictions on buying GameStop and other stocks that hedge funds had bet against earlier this year, on grounds this was needed for the financial and operational stability of its platform. It triggered calls among some investors on Reddit for a boycott of Robinhood's IPO.
The brokerage has also been criticized for relying on ""payment for order flow"" for most of its revenue, under which it receives fees from market makers for routing trades to them and does not charge users for individual trades.
Critics argue the practice, which is used by many other brokers, creates a conflict of interest, on the grounds that it incentivizes brokers to send orders to whoever pays the higher fees. Robinhood contends that it routes trades based on what is cheapest for its users, and that charging a commission would be more expensive.
Sherrie Hardy, another Robinhood customer in Michigan, decided to skip the IPO offerings on concerns that the newly listed shares could be volatile. She said she would wait for its first quarterly earnings before buying the stock. 
To be sure, many Robinhood customers plan to take advantage of the offering and invest in the IPO. Chris Brumby, a manager at a construction company in Florida and Robinhood user, said he was considering investing more than $20,000 in the IPO after watching Robinhood's online roadshow on Saturday.
""I like the product and I know once they get their cryptocurrency wallet, it'll be big business from new cryptocurrency customers,"" Brumby said.
Many IPOs benefit from excluding retail investors, who end up fueling a first-day trading pop by snapping up shares in the open market. By letting many retail investors under the IPO tent, Robinhood is making it less likely that investors will see big gains on the first day. 

In a sign of the potential trading volatility in stock, some Robinhood users, such as Benhamish Allen, a 42-year-old teacher from California, plan to invest in the IPO ""on margin"" by borrowing from Robinhood to juice their returns. 
""It seems silly I should be able to borrow money from a company and then buy that company back with the money I borrowed,"" Allen said.

The French drugmaker said it was now targeting earnings per share growth of around 12% at constant exchange rates this year, up from ""high single digit"" percentage growth previously.
Sanofi, which shocked investors last year with a delay to a COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), reiterated its confidence in the shot, which it hopes will secure regulatory approval by the end of the year.
Europe's drug regulator said last week it had started a real-time review of the vaccine.
Sales of Dupixent, which is sold to patients with eczema but also prescribed for other conditions such as asthma, jumped 57% to 1.24 billion euros ($1.47 billion).
Revenue at the vaccines unit was up 16.2% to 1 billion euros, helped by stronger demand for booster and meningitis shots.
Overall, Sanofi's sales rose 12.4% in the second quarter to 8.74 billion euros, while business net income - a figure the company uses as its core metric to measure profits - was up 16.8% to 1.73 million euros.

Analysts polled by Refinitiv had on average been expecting sales of 8.5 billion euros and net income of 1 billion euros.

(Reuters) -Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD), the owner of the trading app which emerged as the go-to destination for retail investors speculating on this year's ""meme' stock trading frenzy, raised $2.1 billion in its initial public offering on Wednesday.
The company was seeking to capitalize on individual investors' fascination with cryptocurrencies and stocks such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), which have seen wild swings after becoming the subject of trading speculation on social media sites such as Reddit. Robinhood's monthly active users surged from 11.7 million at the end of December to 21.3 million as of the end of June.
The IPO valued Robinhood at $31.8 billion, making it greater as a function of its revenue than many of its traditional rivals such as  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp, but the offering priced at the bottom of the company's indicated range.
Some investors stayed on the sidelines, citing concerns over the frothy valuation, the risk of regulators cracking down on Robinhood's business, and even lingering anger with the company's imposition of trading curbs when the meme stock trading frenzy flared up at the end of January.
Robinhood said it sold 55 million shares in the IPO at $38 apiece, the low end of its $38 to $42 price range. This makes it one of the most valuable U.S. companies to have gone public year-to-date, amid a red-hot market for new listings.
In an unusual move, Robinhood had said it would reserve between 20% and 35% of its shares for its users.
Robinhood's platform allows users to make unlimited commission-free trades in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options and cryptocurrencies. Its simple interface made it popular with young investors trading from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Robinhood enraged some investors and U.S. lawmakers earlier this year when it restricted trading in some popular stocks following a 10-fold rise in deposit requirements at its clearinghouse. It has been at the center of many regulatory probes.
The company disclosed this week that it has received inquiries from U.S. regulators looking into whether its employees traded shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings, Inc before the trading curbs were placed at the end of January.
In June, Robinhood agreed to pay nearly $70 million to settle an investigation by Wall Street's own regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, for ""systemic"" failures, including systems outages, providing ""false or misleading"" information, and weak options trading controls.
The brokerage has also been criticized for relying on ""payment for order flow"" for most of its revenue, under which it receives fees from market makers for routing trades to them and does not charge users for individual trades.
Critics argue the practice, which is used by many other brokers, creates a conflict of interest, on the grounds that it incentivizes brokers to send orders to whoever pays the higher fees. Robinhood contends that it routes trades based on what is cheapest for its users, and that charging a commission would be more expensive. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is examining the practice.
Robinhood was founded in 2013 by Stanford University roommates Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. They will hold a majority of the voting power after the offering, these filings showed, with Bhatt having around 39% of the voting power of outstanding stock while Tenev will hold about 26.2%.

The company's shares are scheduled to start trading on Nasdaq on Thursday under the ticker ""HOOD""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan were the lead underwriters in Robinhood’s IPO.

1390,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 02:03AM ET</span>","European Stock Futures Largely Unchanged; Fed Meeting, Credit Suisse in Focus","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open largely unchanged Thursday after the Federal Reserve concluded its latest policy-setting meeting and as the corporate earnings season continues.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded flat, CAC 40 futures in France rose 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. was flat.
Investors have been parsing through the Federal Reserve policy statement, released late Wednesday, with the U.S. central bank saying that ""progress"" had been made toward its economic goals, potentially bringing forward the time when it might start reining in its bond-buying program. That currently runs at $120 billion a month.
That said, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear, in his subsequent press conference, that the U.S. economy still had to make substantial progress on jobs before any form of tapering, a more dovish tone that the statement suggested.
“Powell hinted that the Fed has already reached one out of two targets and that full employment and inflation ‘moderately exceeding the 2% target’ are not prerequisites for a taper decision. Interesting months are upcoming,” said analysts at Nordea in a note to clients.
European markets have received a positive handover from Asia after reports that Chinese authorities tried to calm market fears about a regulatory clampdown by calling banks overnight. This could allow European investors to concentrate more fully on the ongoing reporting season.
Airbus (PA:AIR), the world’s largest commercial planemaker, sharply raised its forecasts for full-year deliveries and earnings after reporting better-than-expected half-year results. Royal Dutch Shell  (AS:RDSa) also beat estimates, while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) raised its profit forecasts for the year and  Anglo American  PLC (LON:AAL) increased its stock buyback program by another $2 billion.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is also likely to be in the spotlight Thursday after the Swiss banking giant revealed that an independent external investigation into the Archegos scandal showed that it had failed “to effectively manage risk” but it had not been involved in any “fraudulent or illegal conduct”. Still, it posted a 78% fall in second-quarter net profit, hit by a sharp drop in its investment banking revenues.
In economic news, German inflation and unemployment data for July are due later in the session, but eyes will also be on the release of the minutes of last week's European Central Bank meeting.
Elsewhere, oil prices rose Thursday, helped by U.S. crude supplies falling to their lowest level since January 2020, resuming their downward trend after last week’s surprise build.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released late Wednesday, showed that crude inventories dropped by just over 4 million barrels during the week to July 23. 
These stocks rose for the first time in nine weeks the previous week, prompting concerns that demand was peaking in the world’s largest consumer. 
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $72.72 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $74.17.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,816.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1857.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 02:00AM ET</span>","Australia's Macquarie Group cuts dividend outlook, 'deeply' regrets Nuix IPO fallout","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) said on Thursday first-quarter profit for fiscal 2022 was up significantly from the pandemic-hit period a year earlier, but warned of lower dividends to come as it diverts cash to grow its business.
Chief Executive Shemara Wikramanayake also said during a virtual annual meeting that she regretted the impact on investors from the troubled 2020 IPO by Nuix Ltd, in which Macquarie had a 70% stake at the time. The software vendor has lost over half its value since then.
The country's largest investment bank and fund manager said in its quarterly update that its annual dividend payout ratio would be lowered to between 50% and 70% from a range of 60% to 80% at the end of fiscal 2021. 
The decision was driven by its significant capital deployment recently, including A$3.8 billion ($2.80 billion) worth of investments over the past nine months, and its intention to have more ""flexibility"" given ""further opportunities in the coming months"", it said.
Its trading update did not provide an earnings number for the first quarter or explicit guidance for fiscal 2022 earnings. 
The warning of a lower payout drove Macquarie's shares only 0.5% lower in early trading before they recovered later in the day to stand up 0.37%.
""While a reduction in the target payout ratio would normally bode poorly for an Australian financial, given Macquarie's very strong track record in investing incremental capital at a solid return above its cost of capital, we think the market will be more than comfortable,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said.
Asked during a separate media call about a recent news report that a consortium led by Macquarie Group was considering an offer for Sydney Airport Holdings, Wikramanayake declined to comment.
Sydney Airport rejected a A$22.26 billion takeover proposal from a group of infrastructure funds earlier this month.
""DEEPLY REGRET"" IMPACT FROM NUIX IPO
At the virtual annual meeting, disgruntled investors probed Macquarie about its role in Nuix's controversial IPO, Australia's second-largest of 2020, with some investors saying they only invested in it because Macquarie's name was appended to it.
Macquarie profited greatly from the IPO but the tech company has lost over half its value since listing in December after missing forecasts and has been accused by the corporate regulator of allegedly providing investors with misleading forecasts in its prospectus. Macquarie has a remaining 30% stake in Nuix and is its largest shareholder.
Nuix's former CFO is also being investigated for alleged insider trading.
""We deeply regret the impacts that there have been on investors in Nuix,"" Wikramanayake said at the virtual meeting, adding the bank had reviewed its IPO processes and had found no faults. 
""At the time of the IPO, we all had no reason to believe that the prospectus forecasts would not be achieved. Now, clearly circumstances appear to have changed quickly after listing.""
Macquarie was committed to remaining an investor in Nuix, she added. Nuix shares, which listed at A$5.31 per share, were up 1.6% at A$2.54, the largest daily gain in a week.

In its trading update, Macquarie also said its investment banking, asset management and lending businesses had positive outlooks, but last year's windfall from its commodities trading business was unlikely to be repeated this fiscal year.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Thursday morning, after China took action to calm recent market turbulence, while the U.S. Federal Reserve said more economic progress was needed before it begins asset tapering.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.48% by 10:43 PM ET (2:43 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.03%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.38%, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expected to delay its planned asset tapering as it hands down its policy decision in the following week. The delay comes a mere four weeks after the plans were announced and extended lockdowns in Sydney are also expected to take a toll on the economy.
RBA currently plans to begin asset tapering in September, with a review to follow a few months later.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 2.11%. China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.91% and the ShenzhenComponent rose 1.97%. Investors continue to await the impact of a call reportedly led by China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Vice Chairman Fang Xingha and executives at major investment banks.
The hastily-convened was an attempt by CSRC, China’s securities regulator, to calm a multi-day selloff in Chinese and Hong Kong shares sparked by the recent crackdown on several sectors, including private education.
""The message is that profit has not become a dirty word in the Chinese system of 'Socialism with Chinese characteristics', only in certain sectors... how successful the messaging by the authorities will be in putting a floor under the broader Chinese stock market remains to be seen,” NAB head of FX strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
In the U.S., the Fed kept interest rates in a target range between zero and 0.25% as it handed down its policy decision on Wednesday. Although officials discussed how to begin asset tapering, no details on the timing were given. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did say, however, that it would still be a while before conditions for asset tapering are met. The central bank also reiterated that inflation is likely to be transitory and linked to the economic re-opening from COVID-19.
However, the spread of COVID-19 cases involving the Delta strain globally and the ripple effects from the Chinese crackdown remain as risks.
“While the economy appears to be inching closer, the Fed has not yet seen sufficiently outsized data to warrant a meaningful policy change... as a result, we expect the markets to remain volatile in the near-term, driven largely by this season’s remaining corporate earnings announcements, key upcoming economic data reports and the pace of progress in curtailing COVID-19,” AXS Investments LLC chief executive officer Greg Bassuk told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, U.S. second-quarter GDP data is due later in the day. A bipartisan group of senators and the White House also reached a tentative agreement on a $550 billion infrastructure package, which forms part of U.S. President Joe Biden’s economic agenda."

The People’s Bank of China pumped in 30 billion yuan ($4.6 billion) of liquidity into the financial system with seven-day reverse repurchase agreements, resulting in a net injection of 20 billion yuan on Thursday. The operation marked the authorities’ first short-term cash addition of more than 10 billion yuan since June 30. It also comes ahead of the month-end when liquidity is usually tighter.
The move adds to a slew of signs that Beijing is growing uncomfortable with the recent wild swings in the financial markets. China’s securities regulator was reported to have convened executives of major investment banks on Wednesday night, attempting to restore calm after a recent crackdown on the private education industry. State-run media have published a series of articles suggesting the rout is overdone, while some analysts have speculated government-linked funds have begun intervening to prop up the market.
The moves have calmed markets on Thursday. The CSI 300 Index rose 1.2% Thursday morning after being pushed to the brink a bear market on Wednesday morning. The offshore yuan is 0.1% lower against the dollar after a 0.6% climb Wednesday.
“It seems the PBOC wants to help restore market confidence after a few days of wild dynamics,” said Hao Zhou, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY). “In general, this is in line with China’s general approach, which focuses on financial stability and expectation management.”
Interbank borrowing costs declined after the Thursday’s operation. The overnight repurchase rate fell 36 basis points to 1.69%, while the seven-day rate declined 17 basis points to 2.23%.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Thursday forecast strong demand for memory chips and a recovery in demand for display panels due to new smartphone launches, after posting its highest quarterly operating profit in over two years. 
""For the second half, market conditions are expected to be favorable for the component business,"" Samsung (KS:005930) said in a statement, although it cautioned that ""risks of continued disruptions in component supply and uncertainties related to COVID-19 are likely to persist.""
Despite the risks posed by shortages of other semiconductors, it said the memory chip market's fundamentals remain strong on increasing 5G adoption, new smartphone model launches, and sustained demand for servers and PCs.
Samsung said its chip inventory has fallen to low levels as it shipped more chips than previously expected in the second quarter.
The world's top maker of memory chips and smartphones posted a 54% jump in operating profit in the April-June quarter to 12.6 trillion won ($10.95 billion), from 8.1 trillion won a year earlier, its best result since the third quarter of 2018. 
Samsung said the outcome was buoyed by strong memory-chip prices and higher-than-expected demand from consumer electronics makers and data centre customers.
However, mobile profits dipped from the previous quarter due to constrained supply of mobile processor chips and production disruptions related to the coronavirus pandemic.
Net profit rose 73% to 9.6 trillion won. Revenue climbed 20% to 63.7 trillion won.

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it expects revenue growth to ""decelerate significantly,"" sending the social media giant's shares down 3.5% in extended trading even as it reported strong ad sales.
The warning overshadowed the company's beat on Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue, bolstered by increased advertising spending as businesses build their digital presence to cater to consumers spending more time and money online.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said it expects Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s recent update to its iOS operating system to impact its ability to target ads and therefore ad revenue in the third quarter. The iPhone maker's privacy changes make it harder for apps to track users and restrict advertisers from accessing valuable data for targeting ads.
The company also announced on Wednesday that it would require anyone working at its U.S. offices to be vaccinated against COVID-19, joining Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Monthly active users came in at 2.90 billion, up 7% from the same period last year but missing analyst expectations of 2.92 billion and marking the slowest growth rate in at least three years, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""The user growth slowdown is notable and highlights the engagement challenges as the world opens up. But importantly, Facebook is the most exposed to Apple's privacy changes, and it looks like it is starting to have an impact to the outlook beginning in 3Q,"" said Ygal Arounian, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. 
Brian Wieser, GroupM's global president of business intelligence, said all social media companies would see slower growth in the second half of the year and that it would take more concrete warnings about activity in June and July for anyone to anticipate a ""meaningful deceleration.""
Facebook's total revenue, which primarily consists of ad sales, rose about 56% to $29.08 billion in the second quarter from $18.69 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Its revenue from advertising rose 56% to $28.58 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, Facebook said. It pointed to a 47% increase in price per ad.
""In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we expect year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth,"" Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner said in the earnings release.
Net income in the second quarter more than doubled to $10.4 billion, or $3.61 per share. Analysts had expected a profit of $3.03 per share. 
The world's largest social network has been ramping up its ecommerce efforts, which are expected to bring additional revenue to the company and make its ad inventory more valuable. The push will be key to how Facebook, which hosts more than 1 million online ""Shops"" on its main app and Instagram, can grow its ad business amid the impact of Apple's changes.
It is also on the offensive to attract top social media personalities and their fans, competing with Alphabet's YouTube and short-video app TikTok, which recently hit 3 billion global downloads. Facebook said this month it would invest more than $1 billion to support content creators through the end of 2022.
On a conference call with analysts, CEO Mark Zuckerberg also focused on another ambition for the company: the ""metaverse.""
Zuckerberg this week announced that Facebook, which has invested heavily in virtual reality and augmented reality, was setting up a team to work on building a shared digital world, which he is betting will be the successor to the mobile internet. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also dropped the buzzy Silicon Valley term on its earnings call this week, talking about its own plans for the converging digital and physical worlds.
""Facebook has its eye on a sci-fi prize,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). ""This is little more than an ambition for Facebook at the moment...if the idea comes to fruition, it could be a valuable income source."" 

The company also continues to face pressure from global lawmakers and regulators, including from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which has until Aug. 19 to refile its antitrust complaint against the company and from a group of states who said on Wednesday they would appeal the judge's dismissal of their lawsuit. Facebook's market cap hit $1 trillion for the first time last month when the judge threw out the original complaints.
The company, which has long been under fire from lawmakers over misinformation and other abuses on its apps, has also come under renewed scrutiny from President Joe Biden's administration over the handling of false claims about COVID-19. At Facebook's office in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, a group of critics set up an installation of body bags to protest the issue.

The San Diego, California-based company is the biggest supplier of mobile phone chips in the world and the leader in 5G technology, supplying modem chips that help iPhones connect to wireless data networks and the modems and central processors for much of the Android market.
Shares were up 3.1% to $146.86 in after-market trading following the results, which could alleviate some concerns among investors about the impact of the shortage on the smart phone market, including the iPhone. 
Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon told investors during a conference call that the company's efforts to secure its chips from multiple manufacturing partners were making progress bolstering supplies, with the first shipments of significant volume in the fiscal third quarter and more to come in the coming months.
""We're still on track to materially improve supply by the end of the calendar year,"" Amon said. 
The company is also benefiting from the exit from the global smartphone market of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. Huawei's flagship models did not use Qualcomm chips but its rivals, who are now snapping up market share, mostly do.
Qualcomm has boosted sales of other chips, such as radio-frequency chips that augment its 5G phone chips and whose sales have doubled in the past year. Sales are also growing for a variety of chips for cars and for ""internet of things,"" or IoT, applications.
Qualcomm said on Wednesday it expects sales of those chips to hit $10 billion this fiscal year, up from $6 billion the previous year. The company also said it expects adjusted profits of $8.24 per share for its fiscal 2021, nearly double the year before.
Qualcomm's chip revenue forecast for the current fiscal fourth quarter had a midpoint of $7.25 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $6.83 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
CHIP SHORTAGE 
Amon said even as its own bottlenecks ease as it brings on more manufacturing partners, some of Qualcomm's customers cannot find the supporting chips from other vendors that they need to make full devices.
""We continue to see strong demand in every single business outpacing supply,"" he said on the call. 
Apple on Tuesday predicted the chip shortage would start to hit its iPhone in the fourth quarter. 
On Wednesday, Qualcomm said that global sales of 5G handsets for 2021 was likely to come in at the higher end of its forecast of 450 to 550 million handsets. That means that phone makers are likely directing any chips that are in short supply toward production of their more profitable 5G devices. Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 0.14% in after-hours trading after Qualcomm's results.
""While there remain some parts tightness in some periphery chips in the smartphone sector, we don't think its material enough to cause any meaningful downside, as the industry will prioritize the supply for 5G instead of 4G,"" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst at Summit Insights Group.
Qualcomm forecast overall sales and adjusted profits with midpoints of $8.8 billion and $2.25 per share, above estimates of $8.50 billion and $2.04 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
The company predicted revenue with a midpoint of $1.55 billion from its patent licensing business, compared with analyst expectations of $1.56 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
For the fiscal third quarter ended June 27, Qualcomm said overall adjusted revenues and adjusted profits were $8 billion and $1.92 per share, higher than estimates of $7.58 billion and $1.68 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Mobile handset chips remain Qualcomm's biggest seller, increasing 57% to hit $3.86 billion in the quarter.

""Qualcomm has done a phenomenal job in driving the 5G ecosystem. For sure it’s moving a lot faster than 4G,"" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight.
Sales of other chips have also been expanding, with radio frequency chips and IoT chips reaching sales of $957 million and $1.4 billion, up 114% and 83% from a year earlier, respectively.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended little changed on Wednesday but off its session lows after the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economic recovery remains on track and Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was still a ways away from considering raising interest rates.
Keeping the market in check, shares of tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.2% after it forecast slowing revenue growth.
In a news conference following the release of a new policy statement from the Fed, Powell also said the U.S. job market still had ""some ground to cover"" before it would be time to pull back from the economic support the U.S. central bank put in place in the spring of 2020 to battle the coronavirus pandemic's economic shocks.
""It looks like probably the most positive thing for the market was that they are nowhere near increasing interest rates,"" said Alan Lancz, president, Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm based in Toledo, Ohio.
Right after the Fed statement, the S&P 500 index reversed slight declines though it still ended a hair lower on the day.
Investors have been worried about how rising inflation and a spike in COVID-19 cases might impact the central bank's plan to potentially start withdrawing its stimulus.
The central bank also said that higher inflation remained the result of ""transitory factors."" The Fed kept its overnight benchmark interest rate near zero and left unchanged its bond-buying program. 
The Nasdaq ended higher and shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc hit an all-time high as a surge in advertising spending helped it post record quarterly results. The stock ended up 3.2%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 127.59 points, or 0.36%, to 34,930.93, the S&P 500 lost 0.82 point, or 0.02%, to 4,400.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 102.01 points, or 0.7%, to 14,762.58.
The Fed's statement came at the conclusion of its latest two-day policy meeting. 
""They had a chance to signal they were going to become more hawkish and they chose not to take it. The most important thing is they are predictable and they are remaining predictable,"" said Ellen Hazen, portfolio manager at F.L. Putnam Investment Management in Wellesley, Massachusetts.
In other earnings news,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended down 0.1% even as a boom in cloud services helped it beat Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.86 billion shares, compared with a similar average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.85-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.61-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 67 new lows.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 06:32PM ET</span>",Houston man pleads guilty in scheme to sell $317 million bogus masks to Australian state,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -A Texas man has pleaded guilty to involvement in a scheme to fraudulently sell 50 million N95 respirator masks he did not have for $317.6 million to the government of New South Wales in Australia, U.S. prosecutors said.
Arael Doolittle entered his plea to a wire fraud conspiracy charge on Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes in Houston.
Prosecutors said Doolittle and co-defendant Paschal Eleanya tried to sell 3M-branded masks at five times the list price, hoping to collect up $275 million with the rest going to their ""broker"" and to representatives of New South Wales' government.
The U.S. Secret Service broke up the transaction before it was completed, an indictment last November said.
Doolittle, of Houston, faces up to five years in prison at his scheduled Oct. 25 sentencing, and will remain in custody until then.
Kevin Cobb, a federal public defender representing Doolittle, declined to comment on Wednesday.
Charges remain pending against Eleanya. In an email, his lawyer Ali Fazel called Eleanya a ""middleman"" who tried to ensure the parties got what they were negotiating for.
""We are working hard to demonstrate his conduct was above board and hope the government will dismiss his charges,"" Fazel said.
Doolittle separately pleaded guilty in June to wire fraud in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud investors in oil and gas transactions.
Prosecutors in that case agreed to recommend he spend four years in prison in addition to his sentence in the mask case.
3M Co, the world's largest maker of N95 masks, has tried since the COVID-19 pandemic began to stop price-gouging and other improper sales for its masks, including by filing 36 lawsuits and seizing more than 41 million counterfeit masks.
In a statement, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company said it was pleased with the guilty plea, and appreciated U.S. Department of Justice efforts to stop people from illegally exploiting demand for its masks.

Even with COVID cases rising again, people are out shopping for the latest clothing trends. That's why investors should consider apparel companies like Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), TJX Cos. (NYSE:TJX), and Burlington Stores, Inc. (NYSE:BURL).Nationwide retail sales declined nearly 2% in May. However, U.S. retail sales increased more than half a percentage point this past month. This is a positive sign considering some top economists predicted a 0.4% decline.
It is clear the demand for goods is strong, although consumer spending has shifted toward services as opposed to products. Consumer spending is an important gauge of economic health as it accounts for nearly three-quarters of all activity throughout the country. An increase in consumer spending is a sign the economy is transitioning to a higher gear.
The jump in retail sales is significant for apparel companies as heightened retail activity bodes well for clothing sales. Add in the fact that society is reopening, meaning people will spend more time socializing with others while rocking stylish threads, and there is even more reason to invest in apparel stocks. Three such stocks are Ross Stores (ROST), TJX Cos. (TJX), and Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL).

As such, we think two prominent players in this space, Coca-Cola (KO) and Starbucks (SBUX), should benefit from the industry tailwinds. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now. Read on.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Atlanta, Ga., is the world’s largest beverage company, while Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in Seattle, Wash., is a growing company in this space. KO owns or licenses and markets beverage concentrates, finished sparkling soft-drinks brands, enhanced water, juice, and syrups to fountain retailers and wholesalers worldwide. Whereas SBUX operates as a multinational chain of coffeehouses where it retails, roasts, and provides its own brand of specialty coffee. It also produces and sells bottled coffee drinks and a line of ice creams.
Amid a strong vaccination drive, which is facilitating increasing foot traffic at restaurants and tourist places, the demand for fresh and healthy beverages is very high this summer. This, along with rising consumer spending, is driving the sales of non-alcoholic beverage companies. These companies’ efforts to develop healthy consumables, to keep pace with the changing consumer tastes, are also driving their growth. The non-alcoholic beverages market is expected to grow at an 8.2% CAGR to $1.73 trillion by 2028. And due to the very high barriers to entry in the beverage industry, both KO and SBUX should benefit from the industry tailwinds based on their widespread distribution networks.
While KO gained 5.4% over the past month, SBUX has surged 11.5%. SBUX is a clear winner with 64.8% gains versus KO’s 18.1% in terms of the past year's performance. But, which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

Taylor Dart breaks down why you should consider taking advantage of these prices.It’s been a rough couple of months for the Gold Miners Index (GDX (NYSE:GDX)), with the ETF giving up most of its Q2 gains and sliding back towards support near the $31.00 - $32.00 level. While this has been quite disappointing for fully committed investors that were hoping for a meaningful move higher, it’s a blessing for investors that have been sitting on an ample amount of cash, waiting for a chance to buy back their favorite names in the space. Currently, many names are trading at very reasonable valuations, but a select few are sitting at dirt-cheap valuations, with more than 40% upside to their conservative fair value. In this update, we’ll look at a few that look like compelling buys currently.
Some investors view the GDX as the preferred trading vehicle for gaining leverage to the gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) price, but given that there are several poorly run companies in the ETF, the performance of the worst names can drag significantly on the GDX’s returns. This is why I believe the best way to get leverage to the gold price is by investing in some of the best-run companies trading at the deepest discounts to fair value. An investment in individual miners allows investors to get complete exposure to names with the most favorable reward/risk ratios without picking up unnecessary exposure to names that consistently under-deliver. Kirkland Lake Gold (KL), Pretium Resources (PVG), and Integra Resources (ITRG) are three of the most intriguing ideas in the large-cap, mid-cap, and micro-cap space as of this week. All of them should perform quite well even if the gold price remains in a range between $1,725/oz and $1,925/oz over the next 12 months, given that a large margin of safety is baked in at current levels.

This is even more true when rates are falling and growth is decelerating like now. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) and Unilever (NYSE:UL) are two of the top stocks in the sector but which is the better buy? CL.Consumer goods stocks deserve a place in every investor’s portfolio. These stocks are often boring but can be big outperformers in the long-term as they have consistent sales and pricing power.
Thus, they are less sensitive to economic fluctuations and often pay above-average dividends. Needless to say, the current environment of falling rates and growth expectations is a positive tailwind for these stocks.
Sort through the consumer goods stocks and you will find there are plenty of good prospects to pick from. Below, we provide a look at two of the sector’s stars in Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL) and Unilever (UL).
CL makes toothpaste, toothbrushes, and other consumer products, most of which have natural ingredients. CL’s focus on emphasizing its Naturals line is paying considerable dividends as consumers continue to transition to products with all-natural and organic ingredients. It is particularly interesting to note CL has achieved a worldwide household penetration of more than 61%. This means 6 out of every 10 households in the United States use at least one CL product. As a result, CL raked in $16.5 billion in revenue this past year.
CL has a forward P/E ratio of 25.66. This is a slightly elevated ratio. However, CL has priced just below its 52-week high of $86.41 so the ratio is somewhat justified. CL's merits include a low beta of 0.61 that indicates the stock will likely retain its value should the market get rocky.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed flat Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve kept its monetary policy measures steady, and signaled that it would begin to monitor progress toward its threshold to begin tapering monthly bond purchases at upcoming meetings.

""Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals.,"" The Fed said in its statement. ""Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.""
In the press conference that followed the monetary policy meeting, Powell said there was ""more ground to make up"" in the labor market to meet substantial further progress threshold to taper bond purchases. 
The Fed chief also eased concerns about the economic impact of rising Covid-19 cases in the U.S. ""We don't have a strong sense how that [Delta variant] will work out, [but] there has been less economic implications from each Covid wave. [W]e will continue to monitor it carefully."" 
Beyond monetary policy, megacap tech, excluding Apple, climbed to keep a lid on downside in the broader market as investors digested a raft of quarterly results from the tech heavyweights including Alphabet.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rose more than 3% after reporting blowout quarterly results, led by a 69% jump in advertising revenue in the second quarter, with YouTube revenue up 83% from last year.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was flat despite second-quarter results beating Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The results also included guidance that was ahead analysts' estimates, strengthening bullish calls from some on Wall Street.
“Guidance was also ahead of Street expectations and speaks to a cloud story that is just hitting its next gear in Redmond, a dynamic we still believe is underestimated by the Street,” Wedbush said in a note.

Meanwhile, the government is expected to pass multiple spending packages that will bolster industrial production. As a result, we think popular industrial stocks ABB (ABB), Trane Technologies (NYSE:TT), Otis Worldwide (NYSE:OTIS), and Expeditors International of Washington (NASDAQ:EXPD) should gain substantially in the near term. Let’s discuss.Industrial production has been rebounding at an extraordinary pace over the past few months. The phasing out of social distancing restrictions is allowing factories to operate near full capacity. As a result, total industrial production increased at a 5.5% annual rate in the second quarter, ended June 30, while manufacturing output rose 3.4% from its year-ago value, according to the latest Federal Reserve report. Also, utility production increased 2.7% in the month of June.
However, the current 13-year-high inflation rate is putting pressure on industrial and manufacturing activities. Nevertheless, the Fed believes current inflation levels to be temporary and the central bank is expected to maintain its dovish monetary stance in the near term to boost industrial output further. Furthermore, with Congress currently debating multiple spending bills to accelerate the current pace of economic revival, total U.S. industrial production is expected to rise further in the coming quarters.
Therefore, we think industrial stocks ABB Ltd (ABB), Trane Technologies (TT), Otis Worldwide Corporation (OTIS), and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD) should deliver solid upside in the near term.

Therefore, we think popular leasing companies Ryder System (NYSE:R), Rent-A-Center (NASDAQ:RCII), Herc Holdings (NYSE:HRI), and Triton International (NYSE:TRTN) should grow significantly in the near term. Read on.Rising consumer spending has been benefiting the rental and leasing service industry significantly. Despite the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, U.S. consumer confidence hit a 17-month high in July at 129.1 as the demand for manufactured capital goods and business spending on equipment remained high.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Pooja Sriram said in a Reuters interview, “The Delta variant does pose some downside risk, although we do not expect it to derail confidence entirely, given that its spread is uneven and largely concentrated in areas with low vaccination rates.”
However, given prevailing inflation rates and dynamic consumer preferences, companies are renting or leasing capital equipment increasingly. The global leasing market is expected to grow 14.4% year-over-year to $1.36 trillion in 2021, and at an 8% CAGR over the next four years to $1.85 trillion in 2025.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court said former U.S. President Donald Trump and his adult children cannot move into arbitration a fraud lawsuit accusing them of exploiting their family name to promote a marketing scam targeting the poor and working class.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the plaintiffs' agreements to arbitrate claims against the multi-level marketing company American Communications Network did not extend to the Trumps, who had not signed those agreements.
Lawyers for the Trump family did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday's 3-0 decision.
Four plaintiffs in the proposed class action accused Trump, his children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, and an affiliate of the Trump Organization of promoting ACN in exchange for millions of dollars in secret payments from 2005 to 2015.
The plaintiffs said Donald's Trump's endorsement, including on episodes of his TV show ""The Celebrity Apprentice,"" conned them into thinking their investments would pay off.
ACN would charge $499 to clients to sell videophones and other goods, the plaintiffs alleged.
In Wednesday's decision, Circuit Judge Robert Sack said the lack of a ""close relationship"" between ACN and the Trumps meant the plaintiffs had no reason to believe they agreed to arbitrate with the Trumps.
He also said ""there is no unfairness"" in requiring the Trumps to litigate over alleged wrongful business practices, given the plaintiffs' claim they were defrauded into thinking Donald Trump told the truth by endorsing ACN.
The Trumps claimed they had no control over ACN, that Trump's endorsement was simply his opinion and that the civil lawsuit - one of many they face - was politically motivated.
Some defendants prefer arbitration to litigation because arbitration can cost less and remain confidential, and obtaining evidence can be more difficult.
Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said her clients were pleased, and looked forward to gathering more evidence and beginning depositions.

The decision upheld an April 2020 ruling by U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan.
The case is Doe et al v Trump Corp et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 20-1228, 20-1278.

So, if inflation persists, we think it could be wise to bet on these stocks to contribute to an inflation-proof portfolio. Read on.
Several companies have been dealing with inflation by passing higher costs on to their customers through price hikes. The consumer price index increased 5.4% in June, its biggest monthly gain since August 2008. The rising cost of labor, raw materials, and other inputs are primarily responsible for the consumer price increases.
While Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated recently that inflation is transitory, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned yesterday that inflation could be persistent. And while investors are worried about rising inflation, companies that are increasing the prices of their products are not expected to be significantly affected by an inflationary environment.
PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP), Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR), and Tempur Sealy International, Inc. (TPX) have been raising prices to offset increased costs. So, we think it could be wise to scoop up their shares to protect one’s portfolio from the impact of high inflation.

1433,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 12:29PM ET</span>",Senators reach deal on major points of U.S. infrastructure bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate negotiators have reached agreement on the major components of a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, clearing the way for a procedural vote on Wednesday to move toward formal debate and passage, a Republican lawmaker said.
""We now have agreement on the major issues. We are prepared to move forward,"" Senator Rob Portman, the lead Republican negotiator in infrastructure talks, told reporters after a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 
Details of the legislation were still being finalized. But the Ohio Republican predicted that legislative text for the bill would be completed later on Wednesday, when the Senate was expected to hold a ""cloture"" vote to move forward on the package after months of talks. 
The procedural vote would simply limit debate on whether the Senate should begin considering a bipartisan infrastructure investment bill, thought to be in the range of $1.2 trillion.
Four other Republican negotiators joined Portman, including Senator Lisa Murkowski, who said the agreement showed Republicans and Democrats in the often divided U.S. Congress ""can come together over really hard stuff to negotiate in good faith to broker an agreement."" 
The agreement includes $110 billion for roads, $65 billion to expand broadband access and $47 billion for environmental resiliency, the lawmakers said. 
Earlier, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said a procedural vote on a bipartisan bill was possible as soon as Wednesday night.
""Senators continue to make good progress,"" Democrat Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor.
Before the announcement, Murkowski told reporters: ""I think that there is a strong, solid number of folks on both sides of the aisle that want to get on to an infrastructure package.""

Democrats hope to pass this month or early next month whatever measure is agreed upon in the bipartisan negotiations.
That could help clear the way for Democrats to begin pushing another large spending bill totaling around $3.5 trillion that Republicans have vowed to oppose.

Although a failed Senate test vote recently dealt the bill a blow, Senators’ plans to advance the bill’s bipartisan framework in the coming days bodes well for construction stocks. Thus, we believe investing in the stock of relatively unsung construction companies  Quanta Services  (NYSE:PWR), EMCOR Group (EME), and Granite Construction (NYSE:GVA) could be highly rewarding. Let’s discuss.An economic shutdown and supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic battered the construction business last year. However, President Biden’s $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan, which was announced earlier this year, to rebuild the nation’s roads, bridges, and other infrastructure should give the construction industry a solid foundation for growth.
Although the proposed infrastructure framework suffered a setback in a recent Senate test vote, the 22 Democratic and GOP senators drawing up the plan said they hope to advance the bill in the coming days. Since this infrastructure plan is at the core of Biden's ""Build Back Better"" program, the benefits would be even broader for construction materials and heavy machinery companies. Furthermore, the global construction market is expected to reach $12,526.4 billion in 2021, registering a 9% CAGR.
Given this backdrop, we believe under-the-radar construction stocks Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR), EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME), and Granite Construction Incorporated (GVA) could generate solid returns in the coming months.

Investing.com – Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock plunged more than 9% Wednesday as the company’s monthly active user base came below its own estimate for the second quarter and average revenue per user in its mostly-paid Premium service fell.
The company blamed Covid-19 for lighter user adoption in several markets. In some cases, it paused marketing campaigns due to the severity of the pandemic. Higher wages offset the reduction in marketing expenses, Spotify said.
Separately, a user sign-up issue associated with a global third-party platform created unexpected intake friction, a company note said. This issue has since been resolved.
Total MAUs grew 22% year-on-year to 365 million in the quarter, finishing below its guidance of 366 million to 373 million. It added 9 million MAUs in the second quarter.
Average revenue per user in the streaming service’s Premium offering fell 3% year-on-year. Premium revenue grew though, by 17% to 2.05 billion euro ($2.41 billion).
Ad-supported revenue more than doubled to 275 million euro from 131 million euro in the same quarter a year ago, led by the company’s Direct and Podcast sales channels.
Total revenue rose 23% to 2.33 billion, coming toward the top end of the company’s guidance.
Adjusted loss per share was 19 cents, just over half of the loss of 37 cents forecasted.  
Spotify aims to close the ongoing quarter with MAUs in 377million to 382 million range and total premium subscribers between 170 million and 174 million.
Total revenue is seen between 2.31 billion euro and 2.51 billion euro.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 10:47AM ET</span>","Biden to tout tougher ""Buy American"" rules in visit to Mack Trucks plant","By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden will tour a Mack Trucks plant in Pennsylvania on Wednesday to hammer home the importance of American manufacturing and unveil new rules that will gradually boost the U.S. content of goods bought with taxpayer dollars.
Biden will meet with local members of the United Autoworkers Union (UAW), which represents 85% of the 2,500 workers at Mack Trucks' Lehigh Valley plant, and receive a briefing on the new electric-powered garbage truck the company is piloting in New York City and North Carolina, the White House said.
The Democratic president signed an executive order during his first week in office in January aimed at harnessing the vast buying power https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden/biden-signs-buy-american-order-pledges-to-renew-u-s-manufacturing-idUSKBN29U0Z3 of the federal government - the world's biggest single buyer of consumer goods - to bolster U.S. manufacturing.
The new rules unveiled Wednesday followed dozens of meetings with industry and interagency discussions over the past 180 days, officials said. They would expand existing ""Buy American"" provisions, which apply to about a third of the $600 billion in goods and services the federal government buys each year. 
If approved, they would raise the minimum U.S. content for manufactured goods from 55% to 60% immediately, and then to 65% in 2024 and 75% in 2029.
""This proposal will strengthen procurement as a tool to strategically shape markets and accelerate innovation,"" a senior administration official said. ""The future of our economy depends on continuing to make smart investments, giving our workers and companies the tools they need to compete.""
UAW President Ray Curry welcomed the new proposal, saying the president was making good on his promise to focus public policy on shoring up good-paying union jobs for Americans.
""Joe Biden understands what it means to prevent companies from off-shoring those jobs and making sure that we reverse the trend,"" Curry said in a statement. ""Welcome Mr. President.”
Interested parties will have 60 days to comment on the changes before the rule is finalized, the officials said. 
The rule also proposes enhanced price preferences for certain critical products and components, a move that officials said would help bolster domestic production of critical goods and materials.
And it would boost transparency by requiring manufacturers to report the total domestic content of their products, instead of simply certifying that they meet the content threshold.
The new rule would not apply to services, which account for more than half the annual $600 billion in government procurement by the Department of Defense and other agencies, officials said.
Nor is it expected to have an immediate impact on supply chain bottlenecks such a global shortage of semiconductors that has slowed auto manufacturing and boosted inflation.
The officials said the Biden administration would continue to address those logjams through other measures.

Private sector initiatives to boost purchases of U.S.-made goods have floundered in recent years, given challenges in sourcing products at competitive prices.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, for instance, had committed in 2013 to buy $250 billion in U.S. goods by 2023, but dropped the “Made in USA” logo from products on its website just two years later after a critical probe by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 10:43AM ET</span>",Vonovia says keeps options open on Deutsche Wohnen as it raises stake,"By Alexander Hübner and Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT, Germany (Reuters) -Real estate giant Vonovia said on Wednesday it was keeping all options open regarding Deutsche Wohnen (OTC:DTCWY) after it secured control of nearly 30% of the shares in its rival, days after a takeover attempt failed.
Germany's two biggest listed landlords earlier this year revived merger plans, in a deal controversial in Germany because of tensions over soaring rents ahead of general elections in September. Executives have promised the merged company would work with politicians to provide affordable housing.
If Vonovia buys another roughly 1,000 Deutsche Wohnen shares it would cross the 30% threshold that would oblige to make a mandatory offer for the entire company.
Vonovia held 22.3% of shares in Deutsche Wohnen directly as of Monday, compared with 18.4% previously, and has access to an additional 7.7% via instruments, a regulatory release published on Wednesday said.
Vonovia had offered 52 euros ($61.30) per Deutsche Wohnen share in a $22 billion offer, but Deutsche Wohnen shareholders did not tender enough shares by a deadline last week.
Vonovia's failure to secure 50% of Deutsche Wohnen's shares sparked criticism of German takeover law, whose peculiarities incentivise shareholders to hold on to their shares.
Hedge funds, which controlled about 35% of Deutsche Wohnen's shares, tendered too little of their stock in the hope of getting more for them at a later stage. 
Under German law, any acquirer can strike a so-called domination agreement once it crosses a 75% share ownership threshold, allowing it control of the target company's cashflows. The acquirer must, however, in that case offer compensation to holdouts that is typically above the original offer price.
GAME THEORY
""It's a typical game-theory dilemma: everyone believes that their position is more advantageous if everyone else accepts the offer, but you yourself don't. Now everyone believes that - that's why the risk of failure is so high"", said Christoph Seibt from law firm Freshfields, calling for a reform of the law.
Investment bankers agreed.
""The bidder should be given the opportunity to waive conditions after an offer expires - especially if it only narrowly failed,"" said Joachim Ringer, Germany co-head at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), adding that the country's takeover law puts Germany at a disadvantage to other economies. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s co-head of EMEA M&A Birger Berendes said that one solution could be to facilitate the delisting of the target company after an acquirer controls two thirds of the shares.
""(Such a delisting would be done at) the same price as the takeover offer. That would be a fair way for all shareholders,"" he said. This would, in turn, deter investors from holding out.
However, some investors disagreed that takeover law was the reason Vonovia failed to secure a deal last week. 
""It appears Vonovia underestimated Deutsche Wohnen’s broader shareholder base and instead hoped risk arbitrageurs would help it reach the minimum acceptance threshold,"" Thomas Nienaber, Partner at hedge fund Aslan House Capital said.
And Union Investment portfolio manager Michael Muders had told weekly Wirtschaftswoche that his fund did not tender the 2% stake it owns as the offer price was unacceptable. 
Management of Vonovia and Deutsche Wohnen was also at fault, a person who advised on the deal said. 
""The CEOs felt too comfortable that their deal would go through and therefore spent too little time speaking to investors, the person said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press.

Deutsche Wohnen declined to comment, while Vonovia was not immediately available.

(Reuters) -GSK forecast 2021 earnings at the better end of its guidance range on Wednesday, buoyed by a recovery in routine visits to doctors and sales of its COVID-19 vaccine booster that helped the drugmaker beat second-quarter profit expectations.
But rising debts, lingering effects of the pandemic and longer-term worries about the British company's drugs pipeline saw its shares hand back initial gains. 
Despite being the world's biggest vaccine maker by sales, GSK has fallen behind some rivals in combatting COVID-19, focusing on producing an adjuvant to boost the immune response of others' shots rather than making its own vaccine. 
After a project with  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) fell short of hopes last year, GSK reported progress in the second quarter, with 258 million pounds ($358 million) in adjuvant sales. The duo's vaccine is now in late-stage trials and they hope for approvals by the end of the year.
GSK and U.S. partner Vir also announced a deal to supply their antibody-based treatment for COVID-19 to the European Union.
The British company, which is spinning off its consumer health arm to focus on improving its pharmaceuticals business with incoming funds, said it was hopeful of the positive momentum running into the second half, pushing full-year earnings towards the better end of its forecast range.
GSK has said it expects adjusted earnings will decline by a mid to high-single digit percentage this year, not including any COVID-related sales.
But some analysts remained concerned about the challenges ahead, with  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV)'s Nicholas Hyett pointing to ""poor levels of cash generation"" and rising debt. 
And while Citi analysts noted ""upside potential"" to full-year earnings guidance, they said their focus remained on GSK's pipeline of new drugs. 
Pressure to show sustainable growth has mounted on Walmsley after years of underperformance at the pharmaceuticals business. GSK has also locked horns with activist investor Elliott over its future after the planned spin-off next year.
GSK shares, which lost a quarter of their value in 2020, were down about 1% at 1,386.2 pence by 1240 GMT, after initially rising as much as 2% on the results. 
A 49% jump in vaccine sales to 1.57 billion pounds and growth in newer medicines helped GSK post adjusted quarterly earnings of 28.1 pence per share, blowing past analysts' estimate of 19.9 pence. Overall sales of 8.1 billion pounds were also ahead of a 7.56-billion-pound consensus https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/investors/analyst-consensus/analyst-consensus.

However, GSK forecast revenues from vaccines over the full year would be broadly flat, even as some markets such as the United States open up to routine vaccinations, because COVID-19 inoculation rates are lagging in other parts of the world.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 10:13AM ET</span>","McDonald's sales surge amid reopening despite staffing ""challenges""","By Aishwarya Venugopal and Hilary Russ
(Reuters) -Global sales and profit for McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) surged past Wall Street targets on Wednesday as restaurants reopened despite staffing shortages and consumers lapped up a wildly popular celebrity meal inspired by South Korean pop band BTS.
The fast-food chain also raised its guidance for fiscal 2021, saying a slightly quicker than expected recovery should lead to global systemwide sales growth in the mid- to high-teens versus mid-teens previously.
Same-store sales for the world's biggest fast-food chain jumped 40.5% in the second quarter and exceeded the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 for the second straight quarter. Analysts were expecting a 39.81% rise.
Shares were down more than 2.5% as McDonald's still sees business uncertainty due to pandemic-related stops and starts in markets around the world, especially as the Delta variant spreads.
Even so, ""people are venturing out and establishing new routines,"" chief executive officer Chris Kempczinski said during a call with analysts.
Finding enough staff to power restaurants is also still ""challenging"" amid a wide labor shortage in the United States and Europe, he said. 
That has slowed U.S. drive-thru service times by 3 seconds, but applications are increasing in U.S. states that ended federal stimulus benefits, and wages are up about 5%, he said. 
Currently about 70% of McDonald's U.S. dining rooms are open, but Kempczinski said nearly all should be open by the Labor Day holiday in September.
Fast-food chains have successfully weathered most of the impact from lockdowns, with drive-thrus, competitive pricing and a sharp focus on core menu items driving demand.
The Grammy-nominated boy band BTS's meal was launched by McDonald's in nearly 50 countries and includes chicken McNuggets, fries and two dips. It is also still seeing increased sales from the February launch of a line of new crispy chicken sandwiches.
Besides fresh additions to its menu, McDonald's U.S. sales jump was driven by larger order size and menu price increases, which helped it counter labor shortages and higher ingredient costs.
Comparable U.S. sales rose 25.9% versus a year earlier and nearly 15% compared to 2019. Analysts were expecting 23.84% U.S. sales growth, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

Total revenue surged by a better-than-expected 57% to $5.89 billion in the three months ended June 30, compared to a year ago when McDonald's posted a 30% drop due to coronavirus restrictions.
Net income more than quadrupled to $2.22 billion and excluding certain items, it earned $2.37 per share beating expectations of $2.11 per share.

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock rose 6% Wednesday after the company surprised the Street with a profit when a loss was expected.
Airlines and their vendors including plane manufacturers have been among the worst hit in the pandemic, with parts of the world still under lockdowns of varying intensity.
With virus still raging in several countries, international and domestic travel remain restricted. As a result, analysts ruled out profit for Boeing.
Instead, the world’s largest maker of commercial planes booked $567 million in net income, a sharp reversal from the $2.39 billion loss it had registered in the same quarter last year when almost all airlines were grounded. 
Boeing’s total revenue rose 44% to $17 billion.
The company’s adjusted earnings per share came at 40 cents when analysts expected it to record a loss of 81 cents on every share.
Capacity expansion by airlines to cater to booming demand after a year of the pandemic boosted revenue and revenue from services rose, too. 
Boeing delivered 79 commercial airplanes during the quarter and ended the quarter with a backlog of 4,100 airplanes valued at $285 billion. The company secured orders for 200 737 aircraft from United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL), 34 737 aircraft from Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and a total of 31 freighter aircraft.
Production of its troubled 787 aircraft will temporarily be lower than five per month and will gradually return to that rate. Boeing expects to deliver fewer than half of the 787s currently in inventory this year.
It gave an update on another troubled catalog of planes. Boeing said the 737 program is currently producing at a rate of approximately 16 per month and continues to expect to gradually increase production to 31 per month in early 2022.
The backlog at defense, space and security business was $59 billion. The company booked fresh orders for Chinook helicopters for the U.K. Royal Air Force and signed an agreement with the German defense ministry for five P-8A Poseidon aircraft.

1451,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 09:47AM ET</span>",U.S. Stocks Mixed Ahead of Fed; Alphabet Stars,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stood out from the crowd on Wednesday, as Wall Street appeared to ben in a cautious mood ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy announcements.
Alphabet stock rose 3.8% after an earnings update that showed robust growth across all its business segments. Similarly strong results from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) after the bell on Tuesday - the three notched a combined $57 billion of profits in the quarter - have reinforced the belief that many of the consumer habits adopted since the pandemic started will be permanent rather than just transitory. 
By 12:37 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 99 points, or 0.29%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%, while the S&P 500 index dipped 0.05%.
Alphabet's earnings gave a fresh lift to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock, which rose 0.4% on expectations that it, too, will have profited from the boom in online advertising as companies rushed to sell their services to consumers emerging from months of lockdown. Facebook reports after the close on Wednesday.
For Microsoft and Apple, the spectacular results were already baked into the share price, despite the usual illusion of revenue and earnings ""beating estimates."" Apple stock fell 2.4%, while Microsoft stock fell 0.2%. The market's judgment on Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock was even harsher, beating the streaming giant down by 9.0% after its monthly active user numbers came in below guidance.
On a busy morning for earnings, Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock rose 5.0% after returning to profit for the first time in two years. Renewed deliveries of the 737 MAX aircraft, following its clearance from regulators to fly again after two fatal crashes, were behind the result. Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock surged by 23% after the pot company also returned to profit.
Decent results from both McDonalds and Starbucks failed to ease concerns that the two will suffer if the U.S. is forced to close physical outlets again due to the spread of Covid-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went against the months-long trend of reopening on Tuesday by recommending the use of face masks even by vaccinated people in many parts of the country (including New York and Los Angeles). 
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock fell 2.5%, despite beating the 2019 comparable sales figure, while Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock fell 3.1%, burdened by extra concern about a possible slowdown in growth in China. 
Attention is likely to turn increasingly to the outcome of the Fed's meeting, where the policy statement is due at 2:00 PM ET and Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference is due half an hour later. The recent spread of Covid-19 - new cases in the U.S. hit their highest since February on Tuesday - and the understanding that headline inflation should moderate as last year's collapse in energy prices passes out of the year-on-year calculations, are both seen as working against any move to tighten policy by reducing the pace of asset purchases. The Fed is still buying $120 billion of securities a month in order to stimulate the economy.

Investing.com – McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock fell 1% in Wednesday’s premarket trading -- which was off the lows for the morning -- as investors considered how the world’s biggest fast-food chain can continue its growth trajectory.
There has also been a resurgence of Covid cases because of a fast-spreading Delta variant, casting a shadow over major consumer companies. McDonald's stock already has been trading near its 52-week high.
For now, McDonald's is exceeding expectations. Total revenue for the recent quarter rose 57% to $5.88 billion as the world gorged on its new crispy chicken sandwich and a meal inspired by BTS, a South Korean boy band that is hugely popular among teenagers.
The Grammy-nominated pop band’s meal includes chicken McNuggets, fries and two dips.
Diluted earnings per share of $2.37 beat the expectation for $2.11.  
McDonald's same-store sales rose by 41%. Sales exceeded the prepandemic levels of 2019 for the second straight quarter.
Besides chip and gadget manufacturers, fast food chains have been the biggest beneficiary of post-pandemic demand, as people return to restaurants in addition to keeping up online sales.
Sales in the U.S. rose 26% and were driven by price increases the company undertook to mitigate higher wages and raw material costs.

Investing.com –  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock came off earlier lows in premarket trading Wednesday and was down 0.4% as the company raised its annual guidance and pegged revenue from sale of its COVID-19 vaccines at approximately $33.5 billion.
The revenue from COVID-19 vaccines reflects 2.1 billion doses expected to be delivered in 2021 under already-signed contracts as of middle of this month. It could supply up to 3 billion doses if expansion at current sites happens and new suppliers are added, Pfizer said.
The vaccine contributed $7.83 billion in revenue during the second quarter.
Expenses and profit from the vaccine are split equally between Pfizer and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX).
Pfizer raised its 2021 guidance for revenue to a range of $78 billion to $80 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share to $3.95-$4.05. This only factors in the revenue from COVID vaccines already contracted.
It had earlier guided for revenue to come between $78 billion and $80 billion.
Second-quarter revenue at the pharmaceutical giant rose 92% from a year ago to $18.97 billion.
COVID shots aside, Pfizer’s revenue was also boosted by growth in its pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar and oncology businesses as people attended to health issues they had been putting off in the pandemic.  
Excluding revenue from the COVID vaccine BNT162b2, revenue grew 10% operationally to $11.1 billion.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share came at $1.07, beating the estimate of 96 cents.

1456,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 07:54AM ET</span>","Under Siege, China’s EdTech Giants Take Steps to Contain Fallout","(Bloomberg) -- China’s largest private education firms are moving swiftly to overhaul their businesses to adjust to a harsh new reality after Beijing launched a sweeping crackdown on the $100 billion sector.
Two of the sector’s biggest names have in past days reached out to reassure investors and managers their businesses remain viable and won’t abruptly collapse, according to people familiar with the matter. Yuanfudao, the $15.5 billion startup backed by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and DST Global, plans to yank all advertising after already curtailing part of its marketing earlier this year, one of its largest expenses, the people said, asking not to be identified talking about a sensitive matter. But the startup also said it has ample cash on hand to sustain its business, one of the people said.
TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) President Bai Yunfeng told his lieutenants during an internal meeting it’s in no danger of failing but will have to adjust course. It’s considering providing certain after-class courses for free while creating more self-study online resources, a person familiar with the proceedings said. Fresh layoffs are possible, the person added. And Rise Education Cayman Ltd., controlled by Bain Capital, is expanding its non-academic curriculum -- such as science or drama courses -- to offset declines in its specialty of English-language teaching, a person with knowledge said.
Those represent just the opening moves in an industry-wide restructuring as its biggest players from leader TAL to New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. and Gaotu Techedu Inc. come to grips with new regulations that threaten to annihilate much of the private tutoring arena. A Yuanfudao representative declined to comment. Representatives for TAL and Rise didn’t respond to calls and messages seeking comment.
The regulations unveiled last week target after-school tutoring for kindergarten through ninth grade and marked the culmination of a months-long campaign to rein in the ad spending wars and cut-throat competition that’s come to define a sector critical to China’s future workforce. But the growing cost of tuition, along with a relentless stream of ads that play on parents’ paranoia, has triggered widespread outrage over how the industry is enriching entrepreneurs and their financiers while fomenting social inequality.
The edicts unveiled last weekend prohibit firms teaching school curricula from making profits, raising capital on markets or from foreign investors and going public -- measures far more severe than anticipated. In the longer term, investors are bracing for several potential worst-case scenarios from forced spinoffs of their K-9 tutoring divisions to delistings. Many analysts expect layoffs soon.
“While I don’t think the companies would necessarily need to delist like some have suggested, it’s up to each and every firm’s business decision whether they need to spin off their K-9 business,” said Vivien Chan, an analyst with Zhongtai International in Hong Kong. “Big players with a healthy cash flow may choose a long-winding restructuring path, while smaller ones might just be forced out of the market.”
The assault on private tutoring dovetails with Beijing’s campaign to curb the growing power of internet companies from Didi Global Inc. to  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Meituan, who over the years have amassed a hoard of online data that the government now wants to control. The clampdown on the education industry however underscores how far Xi Jinping’s Communist Party is willing to go to contain the country’s giant private sector. In one unusual development, education authorities in the eastern city of Huangshan raided a high-end villa where a public schoolteacher allegedly offered tutoring to middle-schoolers, local press reported.
The three biggest listed firms -- TAL, Gaotu and New Oriental -- have shed at least 60% of their market value since Friday.
China’s online education sector had been expected to generate 491 billion yuan ($76 billion) in revenue by 2024 -- a sizzling pace of growth that briefly made stock market darlings of TAL and Gaotu and groomed giant startups like Yuanfudao and SoftBank Group Corp.-backed Zuoyebang.
It’s also fueled an ad boom that’s buoyed the likes of Tencent, ByteDance Ltd., Kuaishou Technology and Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc., who command prime audiences of hundreds of millions, including anxious parents. Edtech ads have in recent years sprung up everywhere from subway stations to elevators and online, ranging from benign promos to aggressive ads that suggest their children would be stuck in blue-collar jobs if they don’t act now.
In 2021’s first half, education and tutoring ads accounted for about 9% of the total number of ads displayed on Tencent’s and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).’s online platforms, according to data tracked by Guangzhou-based researcher App Growing. Zhongtai’s Chan estimates the K-9 business accounts for up to 80% of New Oriental’s revenue and 90% of TAL’s sales.
“It’s unclear what level of restructurings the companies should undergo with a new regime (well, we’re not even sure if they can stay listed),” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts wrote this week. “This makes these stocks virtually un-investable.”

The industry now awaits clarity from the education ministry and local authorities on the high-level edicts issued by the State Council over the weekend, the people familiar with the matter said. Compounding the problem is the fact that most customers have paid in advance for courses over the summer -- the height of the tuition season -- and would demand classes continue, they said.
Not all the industry’s players are bracing for the worst.  China Online Education Group  (NYSE:COE), whose 51Talk platform connects Chinese schoolkids with teachers abroad, believes it’s not in violation of a moratorium on hiring foreign teachers outside the country because they serve as a matchmaker but don’t hire foreigners as formal staff, one of the people said. In a statement Monday though, the company warned the new regulatory regime will “have a material adverse impact on results of operations and prospects,” adding it’s working with the government to ensure compliance.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
China’s harsher-than-expected new rules for listed tutoring firms could lead TAL as well as New Oriental and its online subsidiary, Koolearn, to consider delisting their shares in the U.S. and Hong Kong. The regulations include barring them from raising capital to invest in other firms that teach the school curriculum. The new regime also turns the sector into a non-profit industry and ban lessons related to the syllabus during weekends and holidays. We expect the crackdown to decimate revenue and widen operating losses for New Oriental and TAL through 2024.
- Catherine Lim, analyst

It’s ultimately unclear how the government clampdown will turn out -- many believe Beijing won’t seek to obliterate an industry that still plays an essential role. In statements over the weekend, all the major education companies said they would comply with the new rules and support the decisions of the Party.
Apps operated by companies including Yuanfudao, Alibaba-backed Zuoyebang, Tencent-backed VIPKid and TAL appear to be operating normally for now. On Wednesday, Yuanfudao officially rolled out a STEAM teaching app (called Pumpkin Science), marking its “transition into quality education”, the company said in a press release.
Zuoyebang is still touting a 3-yuan video package for new six graders on its home page. Some livestreaming courses offered by Yuanfudao for the remainder of the summer break were booked solid. Teaching assistants on those tutoring apps reassured parents the classes they’ve signed up for won’t be shut down. Even apps that let kids take pictures of their homework and search for answers online -- a category specifically called out and banned in the State Council’s document -- worked fine as of Wednesday.
For now, many investors may choose to err on the side of caution.
“There will probably be a grace period when institutions will be allowed to continue with their summer holiday classes but restricted from taking in new students or opening new venues,” Zhongtai’s Chan said. “We still need to see how local governments implement the rules.”

The 737 MAX is integral to Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s financial recovery, as the U.S. planemaker scrambles to recoup billions of dollars in lost sales from the pandemic, and deals with production-related structural defects of its bigger, more profitable 787 planes.
Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun said the company now plans to keep staffing levels stable at around 140,000 employees, after previously targeting a reduction to 130,000 by the end of 2021.
Boeing said it is currently building 16 737 MAX jets per month. The company has said it would lift the jet's output to 31 a month by early 2022.
Boeing's core operating profit was $755 million in the second quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $3.32 billion a year earlier.

PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) -British airline and holiday group Jet2 is in advanced talks to buy dozens of narrowbody passenger jets, with Europe's Airbus seen as the front-runner in a potential blow to Jet2's current supplier Boeing (NYSE:BA), industry sources said.
If confirmed, the deal could involve around 50 Airbus jets, worth approximately $5 billion before widespread airline industry discounts of at least 50%, one of the sources told Reuters.
""As a successful airline and tour operator we are constantly in discussion with different aircraft manufacturers, this is part of our normal course of business,"" a spokesperson for Jet2 said.
Airbus and Boeing both declined comment. 
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the sources cautioned a deal would depend on the outcome of talks that are ongoing amid fierce planemaker competition in the wake of the coronavirus travel slump, but said Airbus was seen as current front-runner.
One of the sources however said it was too early to speculate on a deal with the European manufacturer.
Jet2's potential order comes after a difficult 16 months for the UK travel industry.
Pandemic travel restrictions have lasted longer in Britain than the rest of Europe, and while demand has started to recover, fears over last-minute rule changes mean bookings this summer will be muted compared with expectations earlier in the year. 
A year of booking surges followed by waves of holiday cancellations as restrictions change has, however, helped boost the popularity of package holidays, as customers see the benefit of an operator reorganising their trip for them.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Composite likely to outperform after strong earnings from a number of tech giants ahead of the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 50 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 20 points, or 0.2%.
Jitters over the Chinese government’s regulatory clampdown continue to dog global equity markets, while the decision of the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention to change its advice over vaccinated people wearing masks indoors has also weighed.
However, this week is set to be the busiest of the corporate earnings season, and investors will be focusing on the results from a number of influential tech companies after the close Tuesday.
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported record-breaking quarterly sales and profits, with these companies, who have been behind a lot of the gains the equity indices have posted over the last year, recording combined profits of $57 billion.
Alphabet was the star, with net income rising more than two-and-a-half times to $18.52 billion, boosted by heavy online spending by customers wary of stepping out into the public during the pandemic. 
Microsoft was boosted by stronger-than-expected revenue growth at its Azure Cloud computing service, while Apple benefitted from consumers purchasing more of its premium 5G phones. 
Elsewhere, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) beat overall expectations on strong U.S. growth, but the coffee chain offered up a less optimistic outlook for revenues in China, its largest overseas market.
The earnings deluge continues Wednesday, with quarterly results from the likes of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Ford (NYSE:F), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) scheduled to be released Wednesday.  
Away from earnings, the Federal Reserve concludes its latest two-day policy meeting later Wednesday, releasing a statement at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), and investors will be looking for potential new guidance on the path of interest rates and bond purchases.
Elsewhere, oil prices rose Wednesday, boosted by an industry report which showed a decline in U.S. crude stocks, suggesting healthy demand in the world’s largest consumer.
U.S. crude oil supply data released on Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute showed a draw of 4.7 million barrels for the week ended July 23, after a build of 806,000 barrels the previous week.
Investors now await official numbers data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration later in the day to see if this fall is confirmed.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $71.95 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $73.78.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,797.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1805.

Investing.com – Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock was trading weaker by 2.6% in Wednesday’s premarket trading, pressured by multiple challenges revealed by the coffee chain’s third-quarter report.
Rising raw material prices, higher wages and logistics costs at a time when parts of the world are still under lockdown are some of the headwinds confronting the retail chain, according to the company’s commentary for the fiscal third quarter. which ended in June.
Coffee Futures prices recently hit a six-year high as a cold snap in Brazil has damaged the crop in several regions in the world's largest producer.
Wages have risen as stimulus-loaded economy has boomed and companies have found it hard to meet demand. Hiring has thus been brisk.
The company said it aims to absorb higher product prices by selling more premium varieties.
It also plans to shut down some stores in the U.S. and focus more on its digital operations. This didn't stop it raising its forecast for comparable sales in the Americas and U.S. to grow 21%-22%, up from its previous forecast of 17%-22%.
Same-store sales in China are seen growing 18% to 20%, a sharp cut from the 27%-32% growth forecast previously as the country remains prone to heavy-handed public health measures in response to localized outbreaks of Covid-19.
Third-quarter consolidated net revenue soared 78% from a year earlier to a record $7.5 billion. Same-store sales rose 73% and U.S. sales grew 83% as the pandemic appeared to peak.

UniCredit had announced in February 2019 it would progressively sell local art collections in Italy, Germany and Austria and use the proceeds mainly to fund social impact initiatives.
The bank said on Wednesday it would uphold its social activity commitments but was halting the Art4Future project that had led the group to part ways with some important works of art.
In an effort to make its collection available to a wider public, UniCredit said it planned to provide digital access and launch educational programmes for youths, as well as organising an exhibition.
""UniCredit is a pan-European group with an Italian soul where art and culture are at the heart of this country,"" Orcel said in a statement.
Rival heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) displays its art collections, which last year it valued at 294 million euros ($347 million), in three museums located in Milan, Naples and Vicenza, with a fourth due to open in Turin.
Less than a month after taking the reins at UniCredit, Orcel overhauled the bank's top management set-up, axing a co-head structure put in place by Mustier in a push to simplify the bank's business. 

While Mustier had worked to reduce UniCredit's exposure to its debt-laden home country, Orcel placed all Italian operations into a new standalone business dubbed UniCredit Italia ""to underscore ... the important of our heritage and roots.""

1475,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>",Analysis-Tesla hikes electric car prices in U.S.; holds line in China,"By Eva Mathews, Nivedita Balu and Hyunjoo Jin
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc showed signs this week of divergent strategies in the world's two biggest automotive markets, raising prices to boost profit margins in the United States while keeping prices steady in China and hoping to grow sales there.
Tesla raised prices for the most affordable versions of Model 3 and Model Y about a dozen times this year in the United States, according data tracked by Reuters. At the same time, Tesla recently introduced an affordable Model Y version in China, where it refrained from price cuts.
Tesla posted record vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, and the price increases in North America boosted quarterly profits to a record.
But in China, the world's biggest electric vehicle (EV) market, Tesla faces fierce competition from local rivals and problems that include product recalls, high-profile protests by consumers and pressure from regulators.
Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said introduction of the lower-priced Model Y in China ""may make sustained margin improvement difficult"" for Tesla and raises questions about ""the health of Chinese demand.""
A study by Bernstein analysts found Tesla owners in China were less enthusiastic and had lower repurchase intentions than owners in the United States and Europe.
Tesla raised prices for Model Y Long Range at least six times in the United States this year, bumping by $5,500 to $53,990. In China, the world's most valuable carmaker raised prices of the Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan only once this year. 
The Model Y version a price tag of 276,000 yuan ($42,393.71). The company also has launched promotional campaigns in China such as loan offers.
""I think Tesla is looking to be as competitive as it can be in China. Lower prices will be a part of that aggressive market positioning,"" Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin said. ""There is a very large difference in battery prices in the U.S. and China, as well as local vehicle manufacturing costs.""
Tesla started production at its Shanghai factory in late 2019. It has boosted sourcing of cheaper local components, including batteries from China's CATL and LG's Chinese factory.
""It wasn't so long ago that the group was trimming prices in the U.S. to gain scale and maximize profitability, and it feels like we're now seeing that in China too,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Nicholas Hyett said.
The low cost of producing local EVs in China would have a lasting effect for Tesla, said Gene Munster at Loup Ventures.
""Teslas are on average 3x the cost of a typical EV made in China. So they have to be priced less than the US to compete,"" Munster said. ""Prices of Teslas in China will be below rest of the world for the next decade.""
Tesla also cut costs and boosted margins in the U.S. market by getting rid of some parts like a radar sensor and lumbar support. 
CHINA MARKET SHARE SLIPS
In China, Tesla's share slipped to 11% in the battery electric vehicle market, which excludes plug-in hybrid cars, in the second quarter from 18% a year earlier, according to GLJ research. But data from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) showed Tesla still held a U.S. battery electric market share of nearly 70% as of February, although that was down from 81% a year earlier. 
China accounts for 44% of the global EV market, a much bigger share than the 17% held by the United States. 
In China, Tesla faces competition from electric vehicle makers like Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc and Xpeng Inc. In the United States, Tesla's brand is stronger and its main rivals are legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM), which generate only a fraction of their sales from EVs. 
GLOBAL CHIP SHORTAGE 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reiterated that the company's mission is to make electric cars affordable, and has blamed vehicle price increases on a shortage of chips and raw materials.
Tesla is coping with the chip shortage by using alternative chips and rewriting software, Musk said.
He provided a cautious outlook for chip shortage. ""It does seem like it's getting better,"" he said on the second-quarter earnings call, but added: ""it's hard to predict.""

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 05:52AM ET</span>",Packaging producer Smurfit says price inflation here to stay,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) -Smurfit Kappa said on Wednesday price inflation is here to stay after Europe's largest paper packaging producer offset a doubling of waste paper costs and jumps in everything from glue to pallets by increasing prices in the first half of 2021.
The Irish group raised its prices by about 5% quarter-on-quarter from April to June and expects that kind of rate to continue through the second half and into the first quarter of 2022, Chief Executive Tony Smurfit said.
That helped boost first-half earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) by 6% year-on-year with a relatively small drop in EBITDA margin to 16.7% from 17.5% a year ago. 
First half EBITDA of 781 million euros ($922.2 million) was 8% lower than the record 847 million reported in the first six months of 2019. 
The group said it expected strong and accelerated earnings growth through the remainder of 2021.
Smurfit Kappa's share price, up 25% year-to-date, was 1.2% higher at 0830 GMT.
""It's very hard to see that inflation is not here to stay. Since the end of last year I've been saying we're seeing very significant increases and it's hard to see that they're temporary because there is still so much demand out there,"" Smurfit told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""We're effectively sold out in our product ranges across the world and we don't have any capacity frankly."" 
For that reason, Smurfit said he could not overstate the strategic value of Wednesday's 360 million euro acquisition of a 600,000 tonne capacity recycled containerboard mill in Northern Italy, with the company struggling for paper supply in Italy and nearby France and Germany.
Smurfit is just one of a slew of major companies reeling from the impact of the high prices of raw materials, increased labour expenses and supply-chain woes that are raising product prices as demand rebounds with a reopening of economies. 
Asked if there was a limit on the box maker's ability to pass costs on, Smurfit said its customers, who include Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Nestle, were more concerned about security of supply at the moment.
The group, which has also had to meet exceptional demand for packaging used in e-commerce due to the COVID-19 pandemic, said it has ""for the most part"" been able to fulfil customer needs.
""From time to time because we don't have the paper or the drivers or the starch, we're struggling to keep up with demand and that's in June and July,"" Smurfit said, referring to the usually quieter months of the year.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.4% after two sessions of declines. 
UK's Barclays jumped 4.1% as it announced resumption of shareholder payouts after beating first-half profit expectations, while German lender  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) edged up after it delivered a better-than-expected quarterly profit. 
The tech sector was propped up by a 3.3% rise in Capgemini after the French consulting and IT services provider raised its 2021 outlook.
French luxury group Kering rose 3.8% as second-quarter sales nearly doubled, with its star fashion label Gucci accelerating sharply.
Analysts now expect companies listed on the STOXX 600 to report profit growth of 120.8% in the second quarter versus 115.2% forecast last week, according to Refinitiv IBES estimate.
""The underlying foundations for the market remain as they were. We've got good companies producing better earnings,"" said David Miller, investment director at Quilter Cheviot Investment Management. 
""Ratings are certainly higher than they were, but they're being backed up by earnings growth, and central banks continue to be supportive.""

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 05:51AM ET</span>","Santander profit beats forecasts on strong UK, U.S. performance","By Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) beat forecasts with a 35% jump in second-quarter underlying profit on the back of lower loan loss provisions, strong U.S. consumer business and a rise in mortgage lending in the UK market.
The euro zone's second-biggest lender in terms of market value reported a net profit of 2.07 billion euros ($2.45 billion). 
The result topped the 1.76 billion euros forecast by analysts polled by Reuters and almost matched the 2.1 billion euros underlying profit recorded in the second quarter in 2019, before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
Second quarter's net and underlying profit remained the same as the bank did not book any one-off gains or charges. A year ago, pandemic-related writedowns led to a record net loss of 11.1 billion euros.
""We are on track to outperform our profitability target for the year,"" Santander boss Ana Botin said in a statement.
Its profitability gauge - return on tangible equity ratio (ROTE) - rose to 12.29% at the end of June from 12.16% in March, ahead of Santander's original year-end target of around 10%.
The bank also said it planned to return to its dividend payout ratio of 40% to 50% of ordinary earnings, following the lifting the cap on dividend payments by the ECB last week. 
Even though Santander did not set aside specific COVID-19 provisions in the quarter, its solvency ratio dipped because of shareholder remuneration.
The lender's core tier-1 fully loaded capital ratio fell to 11.7% at the end of June from 11.85% three months earlier, adjusted down from originally reported 11.89%, still within its 11-12% target.
Shares in Santander were down 0.5% by 08745 GMT, while Spain's leading blue-chip index was up 0.6%.
Analysts from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods welcomed a solid set of results in Britain, the United States and Brazil despite weaker capital, though highlighted that Spain and the rest of Europe came in weaker than expected.
COSTS OF RISKS FALLS, LENDING MARGINS IMPROVE
At the end of June, the bank's cost of risk, which acts as an indicator for potential losses in the future, fell to 94 basis points from 108 points in the previous quarter.
Overall, second-quarter net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, rose 6.8% to 8.24 billion euros against the same period last year, with lending growth in the UK and Brazil offsetting pressure from low interest rates. 
Analysts polled by Reuters expected 8.07 billion euros.
In Britain, underlying net profit rose 36% against the previous quarter, helped by lower funding costs, while in the U.S. market, which accounts for almost a third of Santander's underlying earnings, net profit rose 9.4%.

In Brazil, also responsible for a third of the bank's underlying results, operating profit rose 29.5% and fell 8.7% in Santander's home market Spain, where the bank now generates 7% of its business.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 05:51AM ET</span>",Bayer says to appeal U.S. court ruling on PCBs if necessary,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German chemicals maker Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) said on Wednesday it may appeal an order in a U.S. legal case to pay $185 million to four staff members of a school in the state of Washington over exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, made by the former  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co.
Bayer, which bought Monsanto for $63 billion in 2018, said it disagreed with the verdict and planned to pursue post-trial motions and, if necessary, an appeal.
""The undisputed evidence in this case does not support the conclusions that plaintiffs were exposed to unsafe levels of PCBs at the Sky Valley Education Center (SVEC) or that any exposure could have possibly caused their claimed injuries,"" Bayer said in a statement.
""In reality, testing reflected extremely low levels of PCBs in this school.""
PCBs were once used widely to insulate electrical equipment, and were also used in such products as carbonless copy paper, caulking, floor finish and paint. They were outlawed by the U.S. government in 1979 after being linked to cancer and other health problems. Monsanto produced PCBs from 1935 to 1977.
The plaintiffs had alleged exposure to PCB at the SVEC from fluorescent light ballasts, which Bayer said were produced decades ago by customers of Monsanto's products and installed in the late 1960s. 
""These light ballasts were decades beyond their useful life, energy inefficient, and obsolete,"" Bayer said.
""These are historic claims that relate to products Monsanto has not produced in more than 40 years and are unrelated to any ongoing business of Monsanto, and now Bayer.""

In December, a U.S. federal judge rejected Bayer's proposed $648 million settlement of separate class-action litigation by cities and other claimants over waste water contaminated with PCBs made by Monsanto.
Bayer has submitted a revised settlement to the court and is confident that it will be approved, a spokesperson for Bayer said. The company expects a decision on the matter this summer.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was weaker by 1% in Wednesday’s premarket trading on worries that a global shortage of chips could now begin to hurt manufacturing of its most prized product, the iPhone.
A likely slowdown in the company’s services, a product line that now contributes more than a fifth of the company’s total revenue, also weighed on sentiment.  
 Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters: ""We do have some shortages. . .where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those.""
His comments come only a week after reports suggesting that Apple is planning a big increase in iPhone output this year, anticipating a wave of upgrades as 5G services are rolled out worldwide.
The pandemic-induced demand for gadgets like laptops, mobiles and printers has stayed elevated as companies and individuals adopt a blended office-home lifestyle.
The company had a record third quarter through June 26, and handily beat analysts’ estimates.
Consumers purchased more of its premium 5G phones like iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max and more people in China sought to pair Apple watches with iPhones.
The company’s total revenue hit $81.43 billion, up 36% year-on-year and easily surpassing the $73.26 billion analysts expected. Profit soared 93% to $21.74 billion, or $1.30 per share, higher than the $1.01 consensus.
iPhone sales rose 50% and comprised 48% of total revenue. Sales of iPads and Macs came at $7.37 billion and $8.24 billion, respectively.
Sales in China rose 58% to $14.76 billion.
Services revenue in the quarter rose by a third to $17.49 billion. That's an all-time high, but Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri had a word of caution during a call for analysts.
""We expect still-significant growth in services but not to the level that we've seen in June,"" he said.
Apple now has 700 million subscribers across its various platforms that include App Store, Apple TV and Apple Music among others.

1484,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 04:41AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank optimistic on revenues after profit tops forecasts,"By Tom Sims and Patricia Uhlig
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on Wednesday beat expectations with a surge in second-quarter profits after outperforming rivals in fixed income trading and raised its revenue outlook for next year.
The profit figures are good news for CEO Christian Sewing, who launched a major restructuring in 2019 to return the bank to profitability after a string of regulatory failings.
Sewing said in a memo to staff: ""The right strategy and hard work do pay off.""
Deutsche Bank has lost around 8.2 billion over the past 10 years, but Wednesday's results mark the group's fourth consecutive quarterly profit, its longest streak in the black since 2012.
Finance chief, James von Moltke, told reporters he was bullish about the bank's prospects and that revenue next year would probably be higher than previously forecast - closer to 25 billion euros ($29.52 billion) than a previously targeted 24.4 billion euros.
Deutsche Bank's shares rose as much as 4.7% in early trade. They were 0.7% higher by 0820 GMT. 
Net profit attributable to shareholders came in at 692 million euros, from a loss of 77 million euros a year earlier. The figures were better than analyst expectations for a profit of 372 million euros.
""Deutsche Bank's credit positive restructuring is solidly on track,"" said Moody’s analyst Michael Rohr. 
Graphic: Deutsche Bank results - https://graphics.reuters.com/DEUTSCHEBANK-RESULTS/lgpdwmokgvo/chart.png 
The bank decided to abandon a key cost target, which aims to reduce costs to 16.7 billion euros by 2022. The move came after Deutsche Bank flagged a number of unexpected costs in recent months.
Deutsche said it would focus now on a cost-to-income ratio target of 70%.
CEO Sewing said: ""Our priority now is to continue with our disciplined execution of transformation, quarter by quarter."" 
Deutsche Bank's results were supported by a decrease in provisions set aside to cushion fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Provisions for credit losses were 75 million euros, down from 761 million euros a year earlier.
The investment bank's advisory business was a standout amid a dealmaking boom, with revenue surging 166% to 111 million euros. An increase in asset management revenue and fees also helped to boost the bottom line. 
Much has been riding on the performance of Deutsche's investment bank, the group's biggest revenue generator that helped the bank to eke out a small profit for 2020, its first after five years of losses.
Gains in the investment banking business allowed Deutsche to produce its strongest quarter in seven years at the start of 2021. 
Revenue at this business declined 11% in the second quarter from a year earlier. It was the biggest fall in investment banking revenue since the bank's revamp two years ago, but U.S. rivals also had a weaker quarter. 
Graphic: Investment bank revenue - https://graphics.reuters.com/DEUTSCHEBANK-RESULTS/zdpxoyxddvx/chart.png 
Revenue at Deutsche's fixed-income and currency sales and trading business dropped 11% to 1.8 billion euros. But markets divisions at major U.S. investment banks had a 28% decline in revenue, based on analyst research from  Barclays  (LON:BARC).

Sewing in his staff memo compared the bank's turnaround process to a marathon: ""The 30-kilometre (19-mile) mark is where it starts to really hurt. But we also know that it is worth pushing on.""

Wealth managers have seen their fortunes turn around drastically as stimulus cheques and vaccinations reassured investors about the economic outlook following the first few months of last year when clients pulled out money. 
St. James's Place (SJP) expects gross inflows to grow 20% in the second half of 2021, the money manager said, after attracting 5.5 billion pounds ($7.64 billion) in net inflows in the first half. 
Improving confidence and an increase in household savings rates have helped attract 9.2 billion pounds of gross inflows, SJP's chief executive Andrew Croft said in a statement. 
Funds under management at SJP, which provides advice on investment and retirement planning, swelled to 143.8 billion pounds at end-June from 129.3 billion pounds in December. 
Rathbone Brothers increased its interim dividend by 8% to 27 pence, following an 8.2% jump in total funds under management and administration to 59.2 billion pounds.
""Investment markets improved in the first half of 2021 as sentiment began to look beyond the pandemic,"" Rathbone Brothers Chief Executive Paul Stockton said in a separate statement. 
Shares in St. James's Place (SJP) jumped 5.4% to the top of the FTSE 100, while hedge fund Man Group and Rathbone were up 2% and 1%, respectively, by 0809 GMT.
SJP reinstated its interim dividend and set an 11.55 pence a share payout. 
Man Group raised its interim dividend by 14% to 5.6 cents per share and announced a $100 million share buyback plan as its funds under management rose to a record of $135.3 billion from $123.6 billion.

The company added that clients were interested in particular in alternative strategies, which typically aims to provide diversification.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's buzzing IPO pipeline is likely to taper off in the second half of 2021, as Chinese firms temper their expectations for valuations amid a drastic regulatory crackdown in the mainland, dealmakers said.
Investors, on tenterhooks as China's assault on fast-growing private firms has led to an uncertain environment, are also expected to be selective of which deals to buy into, they added.
China's months-long regulatory crackdown has involved firms in the $120 billion private tutoring sector and behemoths like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Ant Group and ride-hailing giant Didi.
""Education is definitely on hold until the regulations are clearer and if you look at the deals that are coming ... we will see valuations across the board perhaps not as high as they were before,"" an equity capital markets banker in Hong Kong said.
""It might not be sector related but driven more by market sentiment towards Chinese companies,"" the banker from a leading Chinese investment bank said, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
The downbeat outlook marks a reversal in prospects for Hong Kong, which analysts had expected would see more fundraisings from Chinese companies after Beijing this month stepped up scrutiny of overseas listings by its companies. 
Public floats by Chinese companies account for most of the IPOs in Hong Kong, the third most popular listing venue globally and a major driver of revenue and fee income for the world's biggest investment banks.
More than $18 billion was raised in Hong Kong via IPOs in the first half of 2021, Refinitiv data shows, versus $4.6 billion a year earlier when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the city.
A record $30.2 billion was raised in IPOs and secondary listings in the second half of 2020, according to Refinitiv data, a level unlikely to be matched this year with the Chinese regulatory changes underway, dealmakers said.
'MOST DEALS ARE ON HOLD'
The largest deal in the pipeline for the second half in Hong Kong is a potential $7-billion secondary listing by China Tourism Group Duty Free Corp Ltd.
Some capital market participants are not giving up hopes of a continued bull run just yet, with Jason Elder, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown in Hong Kong, saying: ""It's still positive and constructive and we've not seen our pipeline disrupted.""
However, many analysts and bankers believe investors will stay away while waiting for the fallout from China's regulatory changes to take hold.
Last week, Beijing imposed stringent requirements on the private tutoring sector, banning firms from making a profit from teaching core school subjects, raising capital, filing for an IPO, and also said no new licenses would be granted.
On overseas listings by domestic firms, China recently said that firms with data of more than 1 million users will need to first carry out a security review.

Investors and bankers are now trying to find clues on which sector may be targeted next, with some pointing towards any which has made entrepreneurs super rich fast and others which have lax labour laws.
""Most deals are on hold until the market stabilizes,"" said a banker at a European institution on condition of anonymity.

(Reuters) -The world's largest chemical producer BASF reported a better-than-expected second-quarter net profit on Wednesday, saying the spread of Delta coronavirus variant has not interrupted orders from industrial customers so far.
Low commodity prices during the coronavirus pandemic weighed on BASF's earnings last year, but the German group recorded a rapid recovery so far in 2021 as the global economy picked up faster than expected.
""We recorded strong demand growth across all regions, especially Asia - without China - and Europe,"" BASF's Chief Executive Martin Brudermueller told journalists in a conference call.
When asked about the sustainability of BASF's progress at a time when the more contagious Delta coronavirus variant could hamper the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, Brudermueller said he did not expect a second large-scale lockdown.
""People around the world have learnt to combine business activity with a difficult economic environment. Everyone has also learnt a thing or two about how to manage a pandemic outbreak,"" he said.
Brudermueller added it was difficult to plan for more than two to three months ahead, but BASF's recovery - as seen in its order intakes - has been continuous so far.
Asked about the exact timing of the sale of BASF's oil and gas subsidiary Wintershall Dea, finance chief Hans-Ulrich Engel confirmed it will happen ""after 2021.""
""We are determined to divest Wintershall, but don't want to commit to a particular date,"" he said.

The German group reported a second-quarter net income of 1.7 billion euros ($2.01 billion), above the 1.4 billion euros expected on average by analysts in a company-provided poll, as it confirmed the preliminary quarterly core earnings and sales and 2021 guidance it announced on July 9.

Medical expenses are one of three key areas of living costs seen as Beijing's targets for social change, heightening expectations that authorities will make healthcare their next focus of market reform.
""Real estate, education, and healthcare are the three big mountains and the government inevitably has to tackle the issues,"" said Ming Liao, founding partner of Beijing-based private equity firm Prospect Avenue Capital.
Selling has been fierce and although the Hang Seng healthcare index bounced on Wednesday, it is down about 11% for the week compared with a similar drop in the hard-hit Hang Seng Tech index and a 7.2% week-so-far plunge in the broader Hang Seng index.
Among mainland stocks, the CSI300 Healthcare index was in freefall from Thursday until it steadied on Wednesday, shedding roughly 13% in the process, trailing a 20% fall suffered by education stocks but outstripping the broader market.
""I think obviously (small investors) have panicked,"" said Andy Maynard, head of equities at China Renaissance in Hong Kong, who feels the rout may have been a bit overdone.
Among the worst hit stocks are those with a tech overlap: JD (NASDAQ:JD) Health International,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Health Information Technology and Genscript Biotech Corp., racked up losses between 27% and 36% over the past five days. 
China's health sector is vast, comprising defensive service providers, pharmaceuticals and fast-growing tech and biotech firms, though it had been seen as exposed to big demographic trends and supported by rising public and private spending.
Reforms over the past decade have sought to expand social health insurance, public procurement of medicine and hospital building. Last month, China's State Council, or cabinet, promised further progress on medicine prices.
Huang Yan, vice president of Shanghai See Truth Investment Management, said the government would likely take a targeted approach to tackling different parts of the sector in its drive for social reform.
""Sectors like cosmetic medicine consume wealth but create little social value,"" he said. ""But the government will continue to support innovative drugmaking, while reducing drug prices through bulk-buying.""

Still, while costs remain high and quality of care has been an issue outside big cities, analysts are nervous about where the authorities' next move lands.
""The jittery...search for the next shoe to drop may keep investors away from engaging for now,"" said Tommy Xie, OCBC Bank's head of greater China research.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Walmart-owned Flipkart has asked India's Supreme Court to restrain the country's antitrust body after it asked sensitive questions in what the firm called an ""invasive"" investigation of its e-commerce operations.
The request, in a court filing more than 700 pages long that has not been made public, illustrates the e-commerce giant's level of concern over the investigation, which has prompted public spats between U.S firms and the Indian government. 
In its investigation, which includes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the Competition Commission of India (CCI) sought a list of Flipkart's top sellers, online discounts and pacts with smartphone makers, among 32 questions it asked on July 15. 
Flipkart told the Supreme Court the details sought reinforced its fear of the ""invasive nature"" of the investigation, and asked it to put on hold both the information request and the overall investigation.
""The information sought...is sensitive in nature,"" Flipkart said in the court document, adding that such investigations could have serious consequences on its reputation and goodwill.
""It is evident that the director-general is determined to take precipitative action,"" it added, referring to the watchdog's investigation chief.
The antitrust body also sent a request for information to Amazon in the investigation, said a source who sought anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Flipkart, Amazon and the CCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Although India's trade minister and a court in south India have said the companies should not shy away from inquiries, Amazon and Flipkart say the CCI lacked evidence and should not have launched the investigation last year.
The request to the Supreme Court comes after the state court dismissed the companies' pleas in June and July, saying the investigation must continue.
The antitrust body, which has set Flipkart a July 30 deadline to answer its queries, had plans to speed the investigation into Amazon and Flipkart after the clearance from the court, Reuters reported in June.
The CCI questions also sought details of policies on showcasing products on Flipkart's website and internal communication with sellers over sale events, the court document showed.
The watchdog also asked for a list of Flipkart's top 100 sellers between 2015 to 2020 and top-selling products.
""The investigation...involves an intrusive and free-ranging inquiry,"" Flipkart said in the document, adding that it would have a ""tremendous"" impact.
Indian retailers have said Flipkart favours select sellers on its platforms to the disadvantage of smaller players.

In February, a Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation based on Amazon documents showed it had given preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers and used them to bypass Indian law.

It has been a busy day of corporate news in Europe Wednesday, with banking giant  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) leading the way. The German lender’s stock rose over 4%  after it easily beat profit expectations for the second quarter even with a drop in revenue at its important investment banking division. It also raised its revenue guidance for 2022. 
Staying in the banking sector,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) stock rose 3.8% after the British bank announced it will resume dividends and share buybacks as first-half profit soared, while Santander (MC:SAN) stock dropped 1% despite the Eurozone’s second-largest lender in terms of market value reporting a 35% rise in second-quarter underlying profit.
Elsewhere, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock fell 1.2% after the mining giant fell short of expectations but declared a special dividend of $3 billion after a windfall on sky-high iron ore and copper prices.
BASF (DE:BASFN) stock dropped 1.4% despite the world's largest chemical producer reporting better-than-expected second-quarter net profits. It had already raised its full-year forecast for the second time earlier this month.
Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) stock rose 4.8% after the low cost airline said it expected capacity to increase to near pre-pandemic levels in July and August as summer demand for European travel grows, potentially helped by the U.K. shortly exempting fully vaccinated travellers from the European Union from quarantine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also set to lift restrictions on fully-vaccinated travelers from the U.S., news that helped International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) stock to rise over 3%
Aside from earnings, European investors await news from the conclusion of the latest policy-setting meeting from the U.S. Federal Reserve, with the central bank widely expected to keep interest rates at record lows.
Also in the U.S., Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and fellow tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) all reported strong quarterly earnings after the close Tuesday. The three companies generated a total of $57 billion in the quarter, an average of $626 million a day.

(Reuters) -British American Tobacco on Wednesday backed its full-year outlook after reporting stronger-than-expected rise in first-half revenue, driven by strong demand for its vaping and oral nicotine products.
The FTSE-listed company said 2.6 million more customers took up its cigarette alternative products such as Vuse e-cigarettes and Velo oral nicotine pouches in the first half bringing its total user base of non-combustible products to 16.1 million, a record. 
In comparison, the company had added 3 million customers for the whole of 2020. 
E-cigarette revenue jumped 59% in the six months ended June 30, while it rose 63% and 38% for its Velo and glo tobacco heating products, respectively.
The maker of Lucky Strike and Dunhill cigarettes kept its full-year forecast for overall sales growth of more than 5% sales and mid-single digit adjusted EPS growth in constant currency terms.
Its shares were flat in early trading. 
Executives told reporters the group had invested more than 300 million pounds ($416.46 million) in the business which sells cigarette alternatives, and had been ""marketing hard.""
Strong promotions in the United States around Velo and around glo Hyper in Europe and North Africa and Japan, saw it gain market share and customers in those markets, they said.

Overall, BAT's total adjusted revenue rose 8.1% to 12.18 billion pounds ($16.90 billion) in the first half, ahead of the 12.02 billion pounds analysts had expected, according to a company-supplied estimate. 
First-half adjusted earnings per share of 154.2 pence, also exceeded the 151.5 pence average estimate.
BAT said cigarette sales jumped 5.8% in the first half, helped by higher prices and a resurgence in demand in emerging markets. It also revised its annual outook for the global cigarette industry, with volumes now expected to drop about 1.5% compared with a 3% decline it anticipated earlier.

Underwriting profits were strong at $127.1 million, despite the impact of Winter Storm Uri in the United States, Lancashire said.
The property and casualty insurer's combined ratio strengthened to 80.7% from 106.9% a year ago. A level below 100% indicates an underwriting profit.
The pre-tax profit numbers came in above analysts' expectations of $33.4 million, according to a company-supplied consensus forecast.
Lancashire said it would pay an interim dividend of $0.05 per share, the same as a year ago.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Gearing up for Jay,"A look at the day ahead from Julien Ponthus.
One thing markets are good at is swiftly changing price tags. Beijing's broad regulatory clampdown on tech has forced investors to quickly reassess the risk premium they are willing to pay for both the sector and the country and the answer is quite unambiguous: much less!
The embattled Hang Seng Tech Index sank to its lowest level since the index's creation in July 2020 and is down about 40% from its February high.
At the same time on Wall Street, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) all reported record quarterly earnings and while their respective share prices wobbled slightly, they stand close to record highs.
Investors did have a moment of doubt on big U.S. tech between February and March when the reflation trade pushed the yield on 10-year Treasuries close to 1.8%, denting the premium they were ready to pay for growth stocks.
But at this morning's 1.24%, the reflation trade seems pretty much on hold and the U.S. 10-year yield isn't much of a threat to the appeal of the stock market.
European bourses look to open higher though that cautious optimism doesn't translate to the other side of the Atlantic where stocks futures are red.
Investors will pay close attention later today when Jerome Powell tells them just how united the Federal Open Market Committee is about the transitory nature of inflation and when a good time to start tapering bond buying might be.
How much this will move markets and how prescient this will look when the U.S. PCE core price index is published on Friday is anyone's guess but in the meantime, there's plenty of inflation gauges to look at starting with the second-quarter earnings season.
Britain's Reckitt, owner of big brands such as Durex, lost over 8% on Tuesday, its worst session since 2003 with investors wondering whether it will be able to maintain margins if inflation keeps on rising.
One thing investors love about consumer staples is their ability to raise prices on consumers' favourite brands, protect their margins and continue to deliver stable sweet bond proxy dividend. Not much so when they can't.
For similar reasons, consumer group Unilever (NYSE:UL) got hit when it published its results on July 22.
On a lot of fund managers' mind is a repetition of 1993's ""Marlboro Friday"", when Philip Morris (NYSE:PM)' decision to cut prices to defend its market share triggered a sell-off across consumer staples.
No doubt will investors closely watch how other big consumer groups like Nestle on Thursday are dealing with labour, transportation and raw material costs.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:
-- German consumer morale steady heading into August
--  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s second-quarter net profit tops estimates
-- Wizz Air sees summer capacity close to pre-pandemic levels
-- Capgemini raises 2021 targets on booming tech demand
--  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN) Group to buy AKKA Technologies in $2.4 bln deal
-- U.S. Fed meeting and presser
-- U.S. inventories

-- U.S. earnings:  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Bristol Mayers-squibb, CME, McDonalds, Boeing (NYSE:BA), Ford, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Raymond James, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)

1495,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 03:00AM ET</span>",Chinese Bike-Sharing Startup Hello Scraps Plans for U.S. IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese bike-sharing giant Hello Inc. has formally scrapped plans for a U.S. initial public offering, becoming one of the first big casualties of Beijing’s crackdown on overseas listings.
The company requested a withdrawal of its registration for a U.S. share sale, saying it no longer wanted to conduct the offering at this time, according to a filing Tuesday. Hello, which is backed by Chinese tech mogul Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co., didn’t provide further details.
The flow of Chinese companies to New York has long been a lucrative machine for Wall Street banks who underwrite the deals, and 2021 had already become the second-best year on record for such listings. Companies have raised $15.7 billion raised so far this year from U.S. listings --more than the entire amount of 2020, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
But Beijing has now moved to sever that flow, proposing new rules earlier this month that would require nearly all companies seeking to list in foreign countries to undergo a cybersecurity review, a move that would significantly enhance its oversight over its tech giants. That tighter grip has thrown a wrench into the listing plans of many Chinese startups, which had typically flocked to the U.S. for its deeper capital markets, more streamlined listing processes, and broader investor base.
Shanghai-based Hello first disclosed its IPO plans in April. Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley and China International Capital Corp. had been lined up as underwriters for the offering of the company, which is valued at about $5 billion, according to data provider CB Insights.
China’s government is overhauling the regulation of overseas IPOs by its companies, as it seeks to tighten its oversight of firms such as Didi Global Inc. (NYSE:DIDI) and ByteDance Ltd., which control reams of valuable user data. While several companies have paused their plans to go public or are considering alternative listing venues, Hello is the first major Chinese company to officially withdraw its U.S. IPO filing.
The Shanghai-based startup -- previously known as Hellobike -- is one of the few firms to survive the bursting of China’s bike-sharing bubble, which had attracted billions of dollars in investment at its height. Apart from Ant Group, its investors include GGV Capital and Shanghai-listed Youon Technology Co., according to its earlier IPO filing.
Daojia, a home-services platform backed by KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR)., and on-demand logistics firm Lalamove are also rethinking plans to list in the U.S., people with knowledge of the matter have said.
China accelerated its crackdown on overseas listings after ride-hailing giant Didi pushed ahead with its U.S. IPO in June, despite being asked to delay the plan as early as three months ago. Even before the new rules on overseas listings were announced, Beijing-based LinkDoc Technology Ltd., which provides cancer-focused health-care services, shelved its planned U.S. IPO earlier this month, before it was set to price its deal.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 03:00AM ET</span>","Barclays announces dividends, buybacks as first-half profits beat expectations","By Lawrence White and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) -Barclays will resume shareholder payouts after beating first-half profit expectations on bumper investment banking fees and the release of cash set aside to cover pandemic-related bad loan charges.
Announcing first-half profits that nearly quadrupled, the British lender said it would pay an interim dividend of 2 pence per share, after the Bank of England in July scrapped its pandemic curbs on payouts.
It also said it would buy back 500 million pounds of its own shares, as it forecast bad loan charges would remain below historical levels due to the improved economic outlook and low default rates on unsecured lending.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) reported profit before tax of 5 billion pounds ($6.94 billion) for the six months to June 30, well above the consensus forecast of 4.1 billion pounds from analysts polled by the bank and up from 1.3 billion a year ago.
The results were boosted by the bank releasing 742 million pounds in cash set aside for bad debt charges that have yet to materialise, as government support measures prop up the economy.
Barclays' investment bank has enjoyed a strong run in recent quarters, as volatile markets during the pandemic led to frenzied trading, while companies have raised record amounts through blank-cheque investment funds and stock listings.
Equities fees rose 38% and investment banking fees from advising on deals rose 27% in the first half of the year, Barclays said.
Its fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) business meanwhile fell 37% against a strong first half a year ago.
The bank said its costs rose 10%, mainly from expenses associated with cutting its real estate footprint and higher bonuses due to its improved performance. 

With the resumption of interim shareholder payouts, Barclays set a positive tone ahead of results from rivals Lloyds (LON:LLOY), NatWest and HSBC over the next week.

1497,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 02:51AM ET</span>",Analysis - No gain without pain: Why China's reform push must hurt investors,"By Tom Westbrook
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Carnage in China's financial markets signals the beginning of a new era, investors say, as the government puts socialism before shareholders and regulatory changes rip apart the old playbook.
Stocks and sentiment have taken a drubbing as Communist Party rulers seek to remake the property, technology and education sectors to curb cost pressures and better serve ordinary people.
The new model appears to place common prosperity, as President Xi Jinping has put it, ahead of helter-skelter growth, investors say.
According to some analysts, it is the most significant philosophical shift since former leader Deng Xiaoping set development as the ultimate priority 40 years ago.
""Chinese entrepreneurs and investors must understand that the age of reckless capital expansion is over,"" said Alan Song, founder of private equity firm Harvest Capital. ""A new era that prioritises fairness over efficiency has begun.""
Bankers and investors say it was heralded last November when regulators torpedoed the listing of Jack Ma's fintech Ant Group, publicly clipping Ma's wings and burning the global funds that had paid up, anticipating a slice of the world's biggest float.
In the nine months that have passed since, developers, commodity speculators, crypto miners, other tech giants and, lately, tutoring firms, have all faced radical rule changes or had regulators aggressively poring over their businesses.
The Hang Seng Tech index, launched with fanfare last July and comprising internet darlings-turned-gargantuan blue chips such as Tencent and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), has cratered 40% since February to record lows.
""The spectre of state intervention into controlling the private sector has created a crescendo of panic-selling,"" analysts at investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. ""The authorities are attempting to reduce social inequality while clamping down on excessive price rises that are undermining the cost of living.""
Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist at ANZ, said the raft of policies, unveiled around the Chinese Communist Party's centenary, underscores the political will to reinforce the Party's roots.
""These policies were announced to reflect the Party's progressiveness"" and appeal to the masses, Xing said. ""They send a message that China is not a capitalistic country, but embraces socialism.""
The messaging in the months running up to the Party's July 1 centenary was also unequivocal, analysts say. ""Common prosperity"" is the over-riding long-term goal, Xi said early this year, and China's development should be centred on people's expectations of better lives, urban-rural gaps and income gaps.
China's State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""THREE MOUNTAINS""
Investors have so far responded with alarm that tipped on Tuesday towards panic. They dumped health stocks in anticipation the sector will be next in the firing line, even as the property and education sectors reel.
Housing, medical and education costs were the ""three big mountains"" suffocating Chinese families and crowding out their consumption, said Yuan Yuwei, a fund manager at Olympus Hedge Fund Investments, who had shorted developers and education firms.
""This is the most forceful reform I've seen over many years, and the most populist one. It benefits the masses at the cost of the richest and the elite groups,"" Yuan said.
The free-falling share price of ride-hailing firm Didi, which found itself in regulators' sights days after its New York listing, has raised questions about China's entire future engagement with foreign capital markets.
Credit risks are also climbing in a country that is still recovering from COVID-19 as authorities appear comfortable allowing state-linked or very large corporations - previously seen as protected species - to teeter towards default.
""Over the past 20 years, Chinese authorities could turn a blind eye to some illegal business practices, tax evasion or wrongdoings, because the economy enjoyed robust growth,"" said Ming Liao, founding partner of Beijing-based private equity firm Prospect Avenue Capital.
Now that the economy is slowing down ""the question becomes how to divide the cake. Thus the need to weigh fairness against efficiency.""
NEW PARADIGMAs the Party prepares for a 20th national congress, which will decide if Xi remains its general secretary for an unprecedented third term, analysts think he will press on with his pillars for reform, one of which is a thriving middle class.
The Party seems determined to emphasise its socialist roots and contrast them against a perception of social problems in capitalist centres such as Hong Kong, they say.
Investors also say that the resilience of exports provides a buffer for policymakers to build a new growth leg from domestic demand and head off dissatisfaction over inequality.
Although household income has outstripped economic growth, both are slowing and, according to research published by the Institute of International Finance (IIF), a trade association for banks, household earnings are still below pre-pandemic levels.
The top 10% of families in China account for 47.5% of household wealth, the IIF estimates, while a 2019 survey from recruitment firm 51job Inc showed nearly 40% of parents spent 20-30% of their income on children's education - seen as unsustainable.
""The old era has ended, and a new epoch has begun,"" said Jack Liu, a veteran maths teacher at Gaotu Techedu Inc, one of the firms upended by education reforms.
""For many tutoring companies, a teacher's ROI (return on investment) is the north star metric... In the future, industry players must fully understand government policies, and unify the interest of individuals, companies, and the country,"" he said.
Foreign fund managers say that they are holding their nerve, but changing tack. Citi Private Bank said this week in a note it was increasing its China exposure, but seeking domestically listed companies outside the crosshairs of regulators.
Prashant Bhayani, chief investment officer in Asia at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Wealth Management, was likewise looking for exposure to the broad sweep of onshore equities outside the tech and education sectors as clients had questions on the crackdown.

""We've seen concerns, not just from North America and Europe but also from Asia, on what is the endgame on policy,"" he said.
""It's definitely a concern, in the sense that these are the areas that were doing the best out of the pandemic and have been identified thematically as mega-trends, so it's also about positioning.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian equities looked set for a fourth straight day of losses on Wednesday as a storm in Chinese equity markets rippled across the region, boosting safe-haven currencies ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.91%, though markets in Hong Kong and mainland China saw milder losses after a sharp sell-off in the previous sessions.
U.S. stock futures, the S&P 500 e-minis, were down 0.26%, pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures dropped 0.11%, and FTSE futures fell 0.3%. 
Asian shares have fallen in each of the three previous sessions as broadening regulatory crackdowns in China roiled stocks in the technology, property and education sectors, leaving international investors bruised.
Chinese state-run financial media urged calm on Wednesday morning, and while Chinese shares swung back and forth in early trading, they did not repeat the sharp plunges seen earlier in the week. 
Chinese blue chips were last 0.46% lower, having had a volatile day, and the Hong Kong benchmark gave up early gains to fall 0.82%. Both were pinned around eight-month lows. 
The embattled Hang Seng Tech Index also gave up early gains to fall 0.4%, a day after touching its lowest level since the index's creation in July 2020. It is down over 40% from its February high.
Japan's Nikkei slid 1.73%, with shares in SoftBank Group, a major investor in Chinese tech, falling 4.7%. 
""China and the Fed are the two key things for today,"" said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific, at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. 
""We are still trying to digest the news from China, what's going to be new is how the Fed view the latest round of (COVID-19) infections and whether they need to readjust their view,"" he said. 
The statement from the Fed policy meeting is due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), with a news conference by Chairman Jerome Powell expected a half hour later. 
Markets will be watching closely for any hints on when the Fed will start reducing its purchases of government bonds and any fresh insight into its views on inflation and economic growth.
The declines in Asian equities on Tuesday spread to other markets overnight, causing Wall Street to retreat a little from the record highs set earlier in the week. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Tuesday down 0.2%, the S&P 500 shed 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.2%. (N) 
After the U.S. close, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) all reported record quarterly earnings, though the smartphone maker's shares slid in after-hours trading on the back of a slower growth forecast.
In currency markets, things were fairly quiet in Asian trading hours, with the U.S. dollar sitting below recent highs after a month-long rally. 
The safe-haven yen held onto earlier gains and the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars dropped back, but while analysts at CBA attributed the earlier moves to falling risk sentiment on the back of the Chinese regulatory crackdown, they said market participants were now turning their attention to the Fed. 

The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was little changed from the U.S. close at 1.236% compared to 1.234%. 
Oil prices rose as industry data showed U.S. crude and product inventories fell more sharply than expected last week, outweighing worries that surging COVID-19 cases would curb fuel demand. U.S. crude rose 0.56% to $72.05 a barrel and Brent crude rose 0.36% to $74.81 per barrel. Gold strengthened, with spot prices above the key psychological level of $1,800, while Bitcoin rose around 1.3%, trading either side of $40,000.

The DBX 4x4, which first rolled off the production line just over a year ago, accounted for more than half of its 2,901 vehicles between January and June. 
""Building on the success of DBX, our first SUV, we have since delivered two more new vehicles and with more exciting product launches to come we are well positioned for growth,"" said Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll. 
Fictional agent James Bond's car brand of choice has had a tough time since floating in 2018, as it failed to meet expectations and burnt through cash, prompting it to bring in fresh investment from billionaire Stroll last year.
The DBX entered production in July 2020 and has helped the company widen its appeal in a lucrative segment of the market which has proven profitable for its rivals.

LONDON (Reuters) - International investors were feeling bruised and uncertain on Tuesday as a third day of heavy selling hammered China's top tech stocks and began to seep into currency and debt markets.
China's rise in global indexes in recent decades means money managers are more exposed than ever as Beijing seeks to reduce the dominance of some of its tech, property, ride-hailing and even private education firms. 
Tuesday's falls included a 9% plunge in internet giant Tencent, its worst in a decade, as its WeChat social network suspended user registrations while it underwent an upgrade ""to align with all relevant laws and regulations"".
China's blue-chip index dropped to its lowest in nearly eight months, the yuan hit its lowest since April and Hong Kong slumped 5%.
In U.S. trading, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China benchmark of Chinese tech stocks listed in New York fell another 6%, taking its losses since Friday past 20% and wiping $500 billion off its value.
""The spectre of state intervention into controlling the private sector has created a crescendo of panic selling,"" said Sean Darby at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), calling it an iron fist in a velvet glove.
William Russell, head of product specialists equity at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, said the moves had left investors blindsided. 
""A key question is what are policymakers in China trying to achieve?"" Russell said. One thing was clear, he said: Beijing wanted to prevent companies becoming too dominant. 
Graphic: BATs vs FAANGs https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egvbknonxpq/Pasted%20image%201627380472497.png 
China is readying a Personal Information Protection Law which calls for tech platforms to impose stricter measures to ensure secure storage of user data.
Beijing-based tech consultant Zhou Zhanggui said investors were over-reacting to the ""rectification"" of Chinese tech companies.
The Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimated that China's equity markets suffered outflows of $600 million on Tuesday after bleeding $2 billion on Monday.
Monday's sell-off was triggered by a clampdown on the $100 billion private education industry which sent shares of tutoring providers such as New Oriental Education & Tech Group and Scholar Education Group down more than 45%.
The sell-off is creating a “risk is that you get some kind of contagion across all Chinese equities ... and investors will get really cautious,” said Rand Wrighton, head of international equities at Barrow Hanley Global Investors. 
U.S. exchange traded firm ARK Invest, headed by celebrity fund manager Cathie Wood, said it had dumped shares of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Tencent, KE Holdings and Byd. 
The firm has also begun cutting stakes in JD (NASDAQ:JD).com and game-streaming company Huya (NYSE:HUYA) since Beijing launched a crackdown on ride-hailing company Didi Global.

Tuesday's heavy falls in Asia also included delivery platform Meituan, which dropped 17%, and ecommerce company Alibaba, which tumbled nearly 8%.
Tencent and Alibaba account for 10% of MSCI’s $8 trillion Emerging Market index. Chinese firms make up around 37% of the index, up from 17% a decade ago.
Investment banks estimate U.S. investors hold about $1 trillion of Chinese internet and tech stocks, or have U.S. listings known as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that Washington has also been clamping down on over the past year. 
""It's definitely a reminder to investors of the risks in emerging markets,"" said Gael Combes, head of fundamental research equities at Unigestion. 
While the market had known state-owned enterprises were used to pilot the economy, ""the tech, internet and fintech companies were valued close to the valuation we'd have in the U.S., and so didn't discount the regulatory risk,"" he said.
AXA's Sailesh Lad said fixed income markets were also affected.
Chinese 10-year government bond futures were down 0.35%. Bonds in property company Evergrade have now halved in price since late May amid concern about its future.
On contagion risk, investment firm Mirabaud underlined that other than Tencent's founders, only one Chinese institution is on the list of its top 20 shareholders.
Alibaba's biggest shareholder is Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), the U.S. ADR top 20 list is full of U.S. and international funds, and the Hong Kong listing is also dominated by international institutions. There is also no Chinese institution in the top 25 holders of the third of the BATs trio, Baidu.
Arnim Holzer, strategist with EAB Investment Group, is advising clients to hedge their portfolios against further China-related volatility in a number of ways, including options positions that would profit from swings in emerging market bonds.

“While I think we may be approaching a bottom in some of the hard-hit Chinese stocks, there is still a likelihood that investors may need to de-risk some of their technology-oriented portfolios,” he said.

At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%, while the CAC 40 futures in France rose 0.2%.
Asian markets weakened Wednesday, falling for a third straight session and hitting sentiment in Europe, as investors continued to fret about the regulatory crackdowns by the Chinese authorities.
That said, losses were more subdued as China’s state-run financial media tried to calm the issue. Additionally, investors across the region will be reluctant to take large positions ahead of the conclusion of the latest policy-setting meeting from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates at record lows. leaving the focus on when the central bank will start reducing its purchases of government bonds and on any fresh developments as regards its views on inflation and growth.
Turning to corporate news,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is likely to be in the spotlight Wednesday after the German banking giant easily beat profit expectations for the second quarter even with a drop in revenue at its important investment banking division. It also updated its revenue guidance for 2022. Elsewhere, mining giant  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) fell short of expectations but declared a special dividend of $3 billion after a windfall on sky-high iron ore and copper prices.
The tech sector will also be in focus after Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) all reported strong quarterly earnings after the close on Wall Street Tuesday. The three giants generated a total of $57 billion in the quarter, an average of $626 million a day.
In economic news, the GfK German consumer climate index stuck at -0.3 in August, unchanged from the previous month but below expectations as the rising Covid cases weighed on sentiment.
Elsewhere, oil prices rose Wednesday, boosted by an industry report which showed a decline in U.S. crude stocks, suggesting healthy demand in the world’s largest consumer.
U.S. crude oil supply data released on Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute showed a draw of 4.7 million barrels for the week ended July 23, after a build of 806,000 barrels the previous week.
Investors now await official numbers data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration later in the day to see if this fall is confirmed.

Regulatory moves aimed at the education, property and technology sectors sparked heavy selling this week in Chinese markets, and have left global investors bruised and uncertain over the outlook for investments in Chinese firms.
In a front page commentary on Wednesday, the state-owned Securities Times said that systemic risks ""do not exist in the A-share market overall.""
""The macroeconomy is still in a steady rebound stage, and short-term fluctuations do not change the long-term positive outlook for A-shares,"" the commentary said.
""The recent market decline to some extent reflects misinterpretation of policies and a venting of emotion. Economic fundamentals have not changed and the market will stabilise at any moment."" 
Other major securities dailies echoed the commentary in market reports.
In a front page story citing domestic fund managers, the official China Securities Journal said the sell-off was a ""structural adjustment"", a sustained plunge is unlikely and the market does not face systemic risk.
A story in the state-run Shanghai Securities News quoted domestic analysts as saying that the sell-off would not continue, and that the market will gradually stabilise.

""For institutions, the decline brings the opportunity for positioning in high-quality shares,"" it said.

In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.54%, as the second-quarter consumer price index (CPI) grew a better-than-expected 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, and 3.8% year-on-year. The data, released earlier in the day, also said the trimmed mean CPI grew 0.5% quarter-on-quarter and 1.6% year-on-year.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.83%, while China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.50% and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.61%.
While shares rose in Hong Kong on Wednesday, passing the 1% mark earlier in the session, caution remained as the impact of a Chinese crackdown continued to be felt. The crackdown, on lucrative sectors including tech and education, is already raising questions on how much further it will extend to curb big companies.
Chinese shares in the U.S. fell to a record drop overnight and continued falling in the Asian session. The offshore yuan weakened, and China’s sovereign bonds also retreated.
U.S. shares pared losses following the Nasdaq 100’s biggest fall in more than two months as well as drops in other major American equity indexes. U.S. Treasuries got a boost from both investors’ flight to quality thanks to a China selloff and a solid auction of its 5-year auction.
The sharp drop in Chinese and Hong Kong shares continued to be of concern to investors, adding to worries about the surge in COVID-19 cases globally and its impact on the economic recovery.
“The turmoil in tech stocks in China is finally bleeding into U.S. tech stocks,” Susquehanna International Group co-head of derivatives strategy Chris Murphy told Bloomberg.
“I am concerned investors will lighten up in general” after major tech earnings heading into “a seasonably weak period for equities,” he added.
Although corporate earnings have given U.S. shares a helping hand so far during the week, the most recent results were mixed. While Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp . (NASDAQ:MSFT) saw their shares fall in extended trading over concerns about slower growth, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares rose thanks to Google’s strong sales.
 Facebook Inc . (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will also report earnings later in the week.
Investors also await the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision, which will be handed down later in the day, where clues on the central bank's timeline for asset tapering and interest rate hikes are awaited. U.S. second-quarter GDP data will follow on Thursday."

(Reuters) -Remington Arms Co on Tuesday offered to pay nearly $33 million to nine families to settle lawsuits claiming that its marketing of firearms contributed to the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, where 26 people died.
The proposed settlements would provide $3.66 million to relatives of each victim, subject to approval by the federal judge overseeing Remington's bankruptcy case in Alabama.
Remington's proposed payout is only a small fraction of the damages that the nine families claimed to have suffered.
In a February court filing, their lawyers estimated that wrongful death claims likely totaled more than $225 million, and total claims including punitive damages could exceed $1 billion.
Josh Koskoff, one of the families' lawyers, on Tuesday said his clients would ""consider their next steps"" in response to the offer from Huntsville, Alabama-based Remington.
""Since this case was filed in 2014, the families' focus has been on preventing the next Sandy Hook,"" Koskoff said in a statement. ""An important part of that goal has been showing banks and insurers that companies that sell assault weapons to civilians are fraught with financial risk.""
Twenty students and six adults were killed on Dec. 14, 2012, by gunman Adam Lanza, who used a Remington Bushmaster rifle as he shot his way into the Sandy Hook Elementary School after shooting his mother to death at home.
The massacre ended when Lanza committed suicide as he heard police sirens approach.
Only nine families of the deceased children sued Remington. The company disclosed the proposed settlements in filings with the Connecticut Superior Court in Waterbury.

Remington had filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2018 and emerged the same year under the control of its creditors.
It filed for bankruptcy again in July 2020, after more retailers restricted gun sales following other school shootings.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government said it sold imprisoned drug company executive Martin Shkreli's one-of-a-kind album by Wu-Tang Clan to pay off the $7.36 million he was ordered to forfeit after being convicted of fraud.
In a letter to U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, who oversaw Shkreli's 2017 trial in Brooklyn, prosecutors said the forfeiture amount has been fully satisfied following the sale of the album ""Once Upon a Time in Shaolin"" and other asset sales.
The sale price and buyer were not disclosed because of a confidentiality provision in the contract, prosecutors said.
Shkreli, 38, paid $2 million for Wu-Tang Clan's only copy of ""Shaolin"" at an auction by the hip-hop group. 
He later bragged he did not plan to listen to the album, and purchased it to ""keep it from the people.""
Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Shkreli, in an email said he was pleased the forfeiture obligation was satisfied, and that the album's sale price was ""substantially more"" than what Shkreli paid.
Nicknamed ""Pharma Bro,"" Shkreli remains widely vilified for hiking the price of Daraprim, which treated a potentially fatal infection, by more than 4,000% overnight when he led Turing Pharmaceuticals, now known as Phoenixus AG.
He has served more than half of a seven-year prison sentence for cheating investors in two hedge funds and trying to prop up the stock price of another drug company he led, Retrophin (NASDAQ:TVTX) Inc. His release date is Oct. 11, 2022, prison records show.
Prosecutors said they still possess two other Shkreli assets, a Phoenixus stake and a Pablo Picasso engraving, that could be applied toward a $2.6 million judgment against him in a separate Manhattan civil case.

Brianne Murphy, a lawyer for Shkreli in the Manhattan case, declined to comment.
In January, Matsumoto rejected Shkreli's request to be freed from prison, rejecting his claim that his deteriorating mental health justified ""compassionate"" release.

Thus, we think popular airlines stocks American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) will benefit. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out. American Airlines Group  Inc. (AAL) in Fort Worth, Tex., is a network air carrier that provides scheduled air transportation services for passengers and cargo. The company offers an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries. In comparison, Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK) operates as a passenger and cargo air transportation company. The Seattle, Wash.-based company operates through three segments: Mainline, Regional, and Horizon.
Significant progress on the vaccination front and the gradual easing of travel restrictions are driving a strong rebound in demand for air travel. Consequently, the airline industry is expected to recover some of its pandemic-led losses in the near term. Analysts expect the global RPKs (Revenue Passenger Kilometers) to improve by 50% in 2021. The rising demand for travel should allow AAL and ALK to improve their financials in the coming months.
AAL has gained 42.2% over the past six months, while ALK has returned 16.8% over this period. Also, AAL's 40% gains year-to-date compare with ALK's 16.5%. But, in terms of their past year’s performance, AAL is the winner with 93.9% gains versus ALK's 72.7%.

By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) -A former supervisor for security operations at eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) was sentenced on Tuesday to 18 months in prison for his role in a cyberstalking campaign that targeted a Massachusetts couple whose online newsletter was viewed as critical of the e-commerce company.
Federal prosecutors in Boston said Philip Cooke, a retired police captain in Santa Clara, California, and other employees participated in a scheme to harass the couple through Twitter and by sending them disturbing packages, including live cockroaches.
U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs called the employees' actions ""really abominable"" as she sentenced Cooke, who must also serve a year of home detention and pay a $15,000 fine.
""It's almost unfathomable to me,"" Burroughs said. ""I'm not sure if I saw it on television I would find it believable.""
Both of the victims, David and Ina Steiner, spoke in court, describing to the judge a bizarre, nightmarish ordeal that left them afraid to leave their home in Natick, Massachusetts, and concerned for their safety.
""We were terrified,"" Ina Steiner said.
Cooke, a former supervisor of security operations at eBay's European and Asian offices, was the first of seven former eBay workers who have been charged in the case to be sentenced. Four others have also pleaded guilty.
Prosecutors said Cooke participated in an August 2019 planning meeting in which eBay employees discussed targeting the couple with threatening messages; unwanted deliveries like a bloody Halloween pig mask; and covert surveillance.
They did so after two top executives, including former Chief Executive Devin Wenig, expressed frustration with the newsletter, EcommerceBytes, according to prosecutors and a lawsuit the couple filed.
Prosecutors said Wenig texted the other executive after the newsletter's editor published an article about eBay, saying it was time to ""take her down."" Wenig was never charged and has denied knowing about the scheme.

Cooke, in court, said he should have sought to prevent what became ""horrific behavior to please the boss.""
""It's crystal clear this was all wrong from start to finish,"" he said.

Stocks sold off on Tuesday ahead of earnings reports from tech giants and the Federal Reserve’s next policy announcement, due out Wednesday afternoon.
The Nasdaq shed more than 1.4% as of the last half hour of trading, and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were also lower.
It’s a reversal for stocks, which have been steadily climbing over the last few sessions on relatively positive earnings reports from big companies. But investors can’t shake inflation fears and are looking to the Fed for guidance on the direction of interest rates.
The Fed’s periodic two-day policy meeting began Tuesday and will conclude tomorrow, with an announcement at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT) and then a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell after that.
Wall Street is watching to see if the Fed’s language shifts even ever so slightly on bond purchases or sustained price increases. Anecdotally, at least, prices for consumers at the grocery and clothing store have risen. On Tuesday, reports about a cold snap in Brazil affecting crops sent the price of coffee soaring to a six-year high.
In addition to the Fed announcements, a number of earnings reports are due out again on Wednesday. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
Boeing results
The aircraft maker  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) is expected to announce a loss per share of 81 cents in the second quarter on revenue of $16.72 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Analysts will be listening for the company’s outlook on production.
Pharma giants
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) reports second-quarter earnings, which analysts estimate to be $1.89 a share on revenue revenue of $11.29 billion.  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)’s second-quarter revenue is expected to be $18.62 billion and EPS to be 96 cents. 
Fast food results
McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), like other fast food chains, is benefitting from a surge in restaurant visits. Analysts tracked by Investing.com see the burger giant reporting an EPS of $2.11 and revenue of $5.58 billion for the second quarter.

1522,By StockNews,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 03:30PM ET</span>",Will the Stock Market Bounce Back Last?,"Last Monday, the major benchmarks suffered their worst declines of the year. The rising case count for COVID-19, primarily driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, led to the most significant drop in two months for the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq. It also sent Treasury yields to their most significant decline in over three months. But the market bounced back on Tuesday as investors reconsidered their worries as hospitalizations and deaths are not at the same level they were during the height of the pandemic. The question is, was last week's rally a temporary move higher, or are the rising cases a much larger cause for concern. I will answer that question and give my outlook below, but first, let's recap the week in the markets. Read on below….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary from the POWR Value newsletter).
Stocks rose sharply on Tuesday following Monday's steep losses and the worst trading session for the S&P 500 since May 12. Investors were essentially buying the dip in the aftermath of Monday's sell-off. Value stocks rebounded the most after falling the hardest on Monday.
The Dow jumped 549 points, recovering from its steepest one-day rout since October.

And because the market is expected to keep moving higher in the near term, we think it could be wise to bet on quality ETFs Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), iShares Trust - iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), and ARK ETF Trust - ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). They each possess higher-than-market return potential.A broader market sell-off was witnessed early last week on investors’ concerns about the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19. However, The  Goldman Sachs Group , Inc. (NYSE:GS) equity strategist David Kostin noted in a report yesterday that, “Investors are concerned about the impact on economic growth from the Delta variant, but the new strain should not pose a major market risk.”
All three major stock market indexes closed yesterday’s regular session at record highs, marking gains for five straight trading days, driven primarily by strong corporate earnings. According to a FactSet report, among the S&P 500 companies that have reported second-quarter results as of July 23, 88% beat the consensus EPS estimates, which compares to a 75% five-year average.
The market is expected to continue rallying in the near term, with promising results expected from the big techs this week. Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet on quality ETFs—Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), iShares Trust - iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), and ARK ETF Trust - ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK)—that have a high beta. These ETFs have the potential to generate higher-than-market returns in the near term.

However, BAC stock has declined 3.3% over the past three months and 8.4% over the past month to close yesterday’s trading session at $38.13.

In addition, its Merrill Lynch unit needs to pay nearly $11.7 million to resolve claims that it overcharged customers who invested in unit investment trusts. Consequently, the stock looks overvalued at its current price level. In terms of forward P/S and P/B, its respective 3.69x and 1.26x are higher than the 3.17x and 1.14x industry averages. So, we think it’s wise to wait for a better entry point in the stock.
However, according to Globe Newswire, the global financial services market is expected to grow at a 9.9% CAGR of 9.9% to hit $22.5 trillion this year.

Investing.com – JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) stock slumped by more than 7% Tuesday following comments from a senior company official that seemed to suggest that the airline’s return to prepandemic performance may take time.
“We are committed to generating better than prepandemic earnings in the next few years by growing revenue and controlling costs, and we are confident that we are on the right path to expand margins in a sustainable way,” said Ursula Hurley, JetBlue’s acting chief financial officer.
According to Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue’s president and chief operating officer, the airline’s third-quarter revenue is likely to be lower by anywhere between 4% and 9% from 2019 period’s $2.08 billion.  
The company expects its third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to range between $75 and $175 million. It aims to generate pre-tax profits in July and August.
Capacity in the ongoing quarter is likely to be flat to 3% down from 2019 quarter levels. It was 15% lower in the second quarter from the same period two years ago.
Second-quarter total operating revenue soared almost seven-fold to $1.49 billion from $215 million as the airline carried more passengers and aircraft utilization rose. But revenue was still lower by 29% from the 2019 quarter levels.
Diluted earnings per share rose to 20 cents from a loss of $1.18 in the second quarter of 2020.

As a result, popular computer hardware stocks  Western Digital  (WDC) and Seagate (STX) should benefit from growing investor optimism about this space. But let’s find out which of these two stocks is a better buy now.Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) in San Jose, Calif., and Dublin, Ireland-based Seagate Technology Holdings plc (STX) are two prominent players in the computer hardware industry. WDC develops, manufactures, and sells data storage devices and solutions, mainly hard-disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SDDs), and serves original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, resellers, and retailers worldwide. In comparison, STX develops, produces, and distributes data storage products and electronic data storage solutions. It also provides storage subsystems and mass capacity-optimized private cloud storage solutions for enterprises, cloud service providers, and scale-out storage servers and OEMs.
Because remote working is expected to continue with the impact of the now rampant COVID-19 Delta variant, organizations are increasingly adopting hybrid working models as a long-term solution. So, the need for efficient computing devices should drive massive demand for computer hardware, especially hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SDDs). The continuing digital transformation is also driving the demand for computer hardware. In fact, the global computer hardware market is expected to grow at 6% CAGR to $1.18 billion by 2025. Consequently, both WDC and STX should see soaring demand for their products in the coming months.

Overall, 2021 has been disappointing for the metal given the Fed's dovishness and rising inflation. Taylor Dart explains why the Fed meeting could be crucial.We’ve seen a rough start to the week for the price of silver (SLV), with the metal down more than 2% to start the week, sliding below critical support at $24.75/oz. While there’s still lots of time left in the week for the metal to recover, a weekly close below $24.75/oz would be a negative development, increasing the probability of a re-test of the $22.00/oz support, which was most recently tested in December. The good news is that sentiment continues to trade in a zone where we have seen bottoms previously, and the metal remains short-term oversold, down for its fourth consecutive week in a row. However, an inability to rally from oversold levels can often be a negative sign, so the bulls will need to step up and start playing defense here immediately.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 12:29PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers urge EPA to reinstate California vehicle emissions authority,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly 140 Democratic U.S lawmakers on Tuesday urged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to quickly reinstate California’s right to set regulations for vehicle emissions, which was taken away by the Trump administration. 
In April, the EPA said it was moving to give back legal authority to California to set tough vehicle emission rules and zero-emission vehicle mandates. In 2013, the EPA granted California a waiver to set vehicle rules. Under Trump, it revoked the waiver.
""The waiver was unlawfully withdrawn under the Trump Administration and should be promptly reinstated,"" said the letters signed by 26 senators and 113 representatives including Democrats Senator Tom Carper, who chairs the Environment and Public Workers Committee and Representative Frank Pallone, who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee.
""The mounting threats to health and welfare posed by climate change makes the authority of the states to lead more important than ever,"" said the letters also signed by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Senators Dianne Feinstein, Alex Padilla Richard Durbin and Ron Wyden.
EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in April the 2019 decision to revoke the state’s waiver ""was legally dubious.""
Earlier this month, 16 Republican state attorneys general, led by Ohio, urged EPA to reject the waiver reinstatement noting that only California can seek to set new car emissions standards: ""The Golden State is not a golden child,"" they wrote.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and EPA are reviewing Trump's March 2020 rollback of fuel economy standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026, well below the 5% yearly boosts in Obama administration rules that it discarded.
Last month, General Motors (NYSE:GM) backed the overall emissions reductions in California's 2019 deal with rivals Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Honda Motor and others, but asked the Biden administration to give automakers more flexibility to hit the carbon reduction target between now and 2026.
The California deal aims to improve fuel economy 3.7% annually between 2022-2026.
Until November, GM backed the Trump administration's effort to block California from setting tougher emissions standards than the federal government. 

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia, which comprise 36% of the auto market, have adopted California’s zero emission vehicle standards.
California plans to ban the sale of new gasoline powered passenger cars and trucks starting in 2035, a step the Biden administration has declined to endorse.

1535,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 12:09PM ET</span>",Robinhood Working on Feature to Let Users Invest Spare Change,"(Bloomberg) -- Robinhood Markets Inc. is exploring new features that would let customers invest spare change and better protect against volatility in cryptocurrency trading, according to code hidden inside a test version of the company’s iPhone app.
Robinhood is developing an option called “round up investments” that will allow users to invest their spare change in specific stocks, according to the code, which was part of a version of the app distributed to beta testers earlier this month. The code also shows that the company is exploring a rewards program that will give bonuses to those using the round-up feature.
Investing spare change has become an increasingly popular strategy for new stock traders and is a key piece of competing apps such as Acorns, Chime and Wealthsimple. The code in the Robinhood app doesn’t indicate where the spare change will come from, but other apps typically connect to a debit or credit card. They round up purchases to the nearest dollar and automatically invest that difference. For example, if a user spends $3.75 on a cup of coffee, 25 cents will be put toward a chosen stock.
Robinhood plans to make its public debut this week, with its shares set to start trading on Thursday. The company is looking to raise about $2 billion in its initial public offering, with a valuation of up to $35 billion. Robinhood is challenging IPO conventions in a variety of ways, including by setting aside up to about a third of its shares for its own users -- in what it expects to be one of the largest-ever IPO allocations to retail investors.
On Saturday during a livestreamed roadshow -- an event typically held in private for institutional investors -- Robinhood executives answered customer questions about how the company might grow in the future.
“There is more we can do with direct deposit and debit cards, particularly given the opportunity to connect rewards with our brokerage and crypto offerings,” Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick said in response to a question on the firm’s growth strategy.
The code was discovered by iOS developer Steve Moser. Work on the features is no guarantee that the functionality will ultimately be released. A Robinhood spokeswoman declined to comment on the findings.
Other app features have been discovered in code before they’ve been announced. Bloomberg News reported on code in  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ).’s app in May that revealed plans for business checking and savings accounts. The new offerings were officially unveiled this month. And evidence of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).’s push into video games appeared in its app before the streaming service disclosed the plans.
Volatility Safeguard
Besides spare-change investing, the code also indicates that Robinhood is working to better guard against the vagaries of the crypto market through a feature called “price volatility protection.”
“To protect your orders against price volatility, we may sometimes skip your recurring orders or buy less than your chosen amount,” a message in the code reads. The code says the app will let a customer know when this happens and will never buy more than a user’s chosen amount.
Robinhood, based in Menlo Park, California, struggled with turbulence in virtual currency trading this year. As the price of Dogecoin boomed and crashed, Robinhood’s crypto trading platform suffered an outage.
Still, investors have proven eager to use Robinhood to trade virtual currencies. The company brought in about $87.6 million, or about 17% of its first-quarter revenue, from cryptocurrency transactions, up from just 3% in the same period in 2020.
Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev said during the company’s roadshow that Robinhood is working on building up its crypto business. Without specifically mentioning a volatility feature, he said that introducing options like crypto wallets will be a priority at the firm.
“We’ve been doing a lot of work behind the scenes to provide our crypto customers with the functionality that they’ve been asking for,” Tenev said. “We want to introduce new features safely, and there’s a lot of items we have to get right from the start. For instance, making sure we get security right is a top priority.”

According to Bloomberg, Moderna’s manufacturing partners outside the U.S. are “facing delays” due to laboratory testing issues that occurred in recent days.
While the problem has been resolved, it has slowed release of Moderna’s vaccine to markets outside the U.S., Bloomberg said.
The news agency reported that the company is shipping shots as it makes them and has no extra shots on hand.
Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that Moderna had pushed back its late-July shipments for South Korea to August due to supply problems that will affect other countries as well.

However, because the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant continues to stoke fears around future energy demand, the stock’s near-term prospects look uncertain. Let’s discuss.Houston, Tex.,-based energy infrastructure company  Kinder Morgan , Inc. (NYSE:KMI) specializes in owning and controlling oil and gas pipelines and terminals in North America. The company owns and operates approximately 83,000 miles of pipelines and 144 terminals. So far this year, the stock has gained 27.1%, driven primarily by higher contributions from all three of its business segments in the second quarter of 2021 relative to the second quarter of 2020. Also, greater demand for natural gas transportation and storage contracts in Texas has helped the company generate robust sales in the last reported quarter.
However, its stock is down 4% over the past month. This can be attributed primarily to volatility in oil prices as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia—collectively known as OPEC+—reached an agreement to boost oil supply to cool oil prices and meet rising demand. 
Although KMI’s diversified portfolio and its plans to acquire a leading supplier of liquefied natural gas in the Midwest should help it stand out in the energy market, concerns related to the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant and its potential reduce energy demand could cause KMI’s shares to retreat in the near term.

CHARLESTON (Reuters) -Lawyers for a West Virginia city and its county made their closing arguments on Tuesday in their three-month landmark trial against the nation's largest drug distributors, seeking $2.5 billion to remedy an opioid crisis they say the companies helped cause.
Huntington and Cabell County, along with the rest of the state's local governments, have opposed the $21 billion nationwide settlement with distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) announced last week, instead betting that they can do better on their own.
The lawyers laid out their case to U.S. District Judge David Faber in Charleston and said that evidence showed the distributors were responsible for the region's addiction crisis.
“81 million pills, distributed to a community of 100,000 people or less, isn’t a substantial factor in the opioid epidemic,"" attorney Paul Farrell, who represents Cabell County, told the judge. ""It will cause an opioid epidemic.”
The non-jury trial will be decided by Faber, who must determine if the companies are liable for the epidemic and what they must pay to remedy it.
The distributors' lawyers are expected to make their closing arguments later on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The defendants have denied the claims, saying they complied with state and federal laws and blame doctors' prescribing practices for a surge in opioid use.
Huntington and Cabell's case was the first against the distributors to go to trial and will be a key test of the allegations.
Farrell told Faber that opioid addiction is an ""imminent threat to public safety."" 
He detailed the severity of the crisis in Huntington, where he said there had been 6,494 overdoses from 2015 to 2020 and 1,151 overdose deaths from 2001 to 2018. More than 8,000 suffered from opioid use disorder, he told the judge.
He said 10% of the Cabell County's roughly 91,000 residents were addicted to opioids.
Nationwide, nearly 500,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the from 1999 to 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC earlier this month said provisional data showed 69,710 opioid overdose deaths in 2020, up more than 36% from the previous year.
More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed by local governments around the country accusing drugmakers of downplaying the risk of opioid pain medications, and distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that they were being sold illegally.
Faber has heard testimony from Huntington Fire Chief Jan Rader, who described the impact of opioid addiction on the region as ""carnage,"" with thousands of overdose deaths and a flood of emergency calls overwhelming the city, the Mountain State Spotlight reported.
He also saw internal AmerisourceBergen emails mocking prescription opioid addiction in the state, including parody lyrics for the theme song to the television sitcom ""The Beverly Hillbillies.""
The title of the show, about a formerly poor family that moves to a wealthy California enclave, used a disparaging term for rural Americans.
Former AmerisourceBergen Vice President Chris Zimmerman, the author of some of those emails, apologized in court but said the messages did not reflect the company's culture, according to newspaper reports.
Other trials are also under way against drugmakers in New York and California, and pharmacies are scheduled to face trials in the coming year.
Last week's settlement, which also includes $5 billion from drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), could point the way to a broader deal including more defendants. But getting the full $26 billion depends on widespread participation by states and local governments, and some have expressed skepticism.

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey last week said the state was a ""resounding no"" on the deal, calling it unfair to smaller but harder-hit states.
Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, is expected in the coming weeks to seek approval from a U.S. bankruptcy court for a $10 billion plan to resolve the thousands of lawsuits against the company.

Investing.com – Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) stock fell 1% Tuesday as strong demand for corn in China and a robust performance in crushing boosted total revenue by 41%, to $22.93 billion, and the company forecast a “very strong full-year outlook.""
The world’s most populous country imported more corn to cool down local prices.
China has long restricted the import of corn via a system of low-tariff quotas, historically totaling around 7 million tons annually, according to Reuters.
The surge in benchmark Dalian corn prices last year, however, outstripped international prices so much that traders could still import, pay the full tariff and make a profit, Reuters said.
Crushing had substantially higher year-over-year sales. The business executed well in an environment of strong vegetable oil demand to deliver higher execution margins in North American soy and EU softseeds, the company said.
Sales of refined products were significantly higher than the same period last year, driven by continued recovery in foodservice as economies reopened. Sweetener volumes were higher, reflecting the beginnings of a recovery in demand from the foodservice channel.
In North America and EMEA, the flavors business delivered strong volumes and improved product mix, particularly in the beverage segment. In health and wellness, probiotics saw stronger sales and margins.
Adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.33 from 85 cents in the same quarter a year ago, surpassing the estimate of $1.02.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Tuesday, with heavy selling in Chinese markets, the start of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting and the prospect of earnings from megacap U.S. tech companies all arguing in favor of caution in the near term.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 177 points, or 0.5% at 34,968 points. The S&P 500 was also down 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4%. All three had finished at record highs on Monday, supported by an ongoing earnings season that is broadly living up to expectations. 
Another marginal headwind came from June's durable goods orders, which rose by less than forecast at only 0.3%. That was their weakest performance in five months. 
However, many of the industrials reporting earnings before the bell had positive stories to tell.  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) stock rose 3.3% after it raised its full-year outlook for industrial cash flow, the metric most closely tracked by the market. The report reflected improved conditions for its aviation division, as revenue from servicing aero engines picked up in line with the revival in air travel. The same factor also enabled Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) - the owner of Pratt & Whitney - to beat expectations with its earnings update. Raytheon stock rose 2.7%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock opened lower despite posting gains in both after-market and premarket sessions on the back of its record sales and profit numbers released late Monday. Despite a best-ever operating performance, the company's guidance contained some disappointments, with fresh delays to the Semi and cybertruck projects, and CEO Elon Musk - currently on trial for defrauding investors with the acquisition of Solar City in 2016 - saying he will step back from future earnings calls. 
Chinese ADRs were once again in the spotlight, after what amounted to panic selling in Chinese stock and bond markets overnight.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) stock fell 2.7% and Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) stock fell 4.6% as U.S. investors continued to bail out against a backdrop of an ever-broader assault on the country's Internet giants by Chinese regulators. There was, however, some respite for educational technology names after a torrid couple of sessions. TAL Education (NYSE:TAL), New Oriental Education & Technology (NYSE:EDU) and GSX Techedu (NYSE:GOTU) all rose by between 12% and 17%, but have still lost more than half their value since news first leaked that the Chinese government wants them to restructure as not-for-profit operations.
Elsewhere,  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) stock fell 9.1% after it warned that margins may be squeezed over the rest of the year, despite CEO Carol Tomé’s “better not bigger"" approach. That overshadowed a healthy rise in both earnings and revenue in the second quarter, thanks to sustained high demand for courier services during the pandemic. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock also fell 4.8% to a three-month low amid concerns it will suffer a similar fate. 
The Federal Reserve begins a two-day policy meeting later, at a time when inflation-adjusted yields on U.S. bonds are at their lowest ever. Low real yields typically are an expression of doubt about future growth, and the current level is starkly at odds with markets that are as expensive now as at any time since the Internet bubble over 20 years ago."

LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) has appointed Omar Faruqui as co-head of its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) franchise in Europe, the Middle East and Africa as part of a leadership shake-up to ride a wave of deal-making activity in the post-COVID world.
The British bank said on Tuesday that Faruqui will share the leadership of its EMEA M&A business with Pier Luigi Colizzi, who recently took on an expanded role as head of Barclays' investment banking for continental Europe.
Faruqui, who joined Barclays in 2018 from HSBC to jointly run UK M&A with Derek Shakespeare, is one of the most senior dealmakers within the firm.
The power sharing structure will allow Barclays to lead its M&A operations in EMEA from London - where Faruqui is based - but also from the continent with Colizzi recently relocating to Milan.
As part of the new structure, Shakespeare - an 11-year old Barclays veteran - will become chairman of UK M&A focusing purely on advising British companies and deepening relationships with new clients. He will also retain his responsibilities as head for financial institution group (FIG) M&A in EMEA.
""These appointments reflect our focus on EMEA and, in particular, the M&A opportunity in the region,"" said Reid Marsh, head of investment banking for Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific, who announced the new roles alongside the bank's global head of M&A, Gary Posternack.

Shares of the company, which posted a rise in revenue in all four of its units, were up more than 1% in premarket trading.
As demand for travel returned quicker than expected, airlines have rushed to return planes to skies and recall crews, boosting revenue at its Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney units by 6% and 19%, respectively, on an adjusted basis.
""What really happened in the second quarter is airlines aggressively got back into the business of making sure their fleets were ready for this summer travel season,"" Neil Mitchill, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN)'s chief financial officer, told Reuters.
However, the recovery could be thwarted by the highly transmissible COVID-19 Delta variant that has led to a rise in cases in several countries, with the United States planning to keep existing travel restrictions despite months of lobbying by airlines.
Raytheon now expects full-year earnings of $3.85 and $4.00 per share, above its previous forecast of $3.50 and $3.70.

The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company also raised the lower end of its fiscal year revenue forecast to $64.4 billion from $63.9 billion. The upper end of the outlook remains at $65.4 billion.

Allianz (DE:ALVG), Germany's biggest insurer, gave its first damages estimate on Tuesday, saying it expects claims of more than 500 million euros from storm Bernd.

This year is on course to be the most expensive year for insurers in Germany since 2002, when various storms caused 10.9 billion euros in claims, GDV said. 
About 40,000 vehicles were damaged or destroyed in the recent storms, it added.
Allianz said it had already received claims for about 10,000 homes and 3,000 vehicles and expects the figures to rise to 30,000 and 5,000 respectively.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain has eased rules for so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) to attract more listings to London, just as global regulators have put a watch on SPACs, which may already be peaking in popularity.
After a surge in activity in SPACs or ""blank check"" companies on Wall Street and more recently in the European Union and emerging markets, Britain is keen that London is not left behind.
SPACs list on an exchange and must use the proceeds to buy an existing or target company within a set timeframe. This process provides a quicker route to a stock market listing as it sidesteps the lengthy process that leads to an initial public offering.
Under previous UK rules, shares in SPACs were suspended when a target company was identified, effectively trapping investors and putting them off participating in the UK market.
The Financial Conduct Authority in April had proposed an easing of the rules, waiving the suspension rule if a SPAC raised at least 200 million pounds ($275.66 million) from its float.
On Tuesday, the watchdog cut this to 100 million pounds in its final version of the rules.
""The final rules aim to provide more flexibility to larger SPACs, provided they embed certain features that promote investor protection and the smooth operation of our markets,"" the FCA said in a statement.
To ensure investors are protected, the FCA also said that investors have redemption rights ahead of a proposed acquisition and a shareholder vote. The new rules come into effect on Aug. 10.
""The rules eliminate the damage unique to UK SPACs of investors being stuck,"" said Charles Howarth, partner at CMS law firm. ""The timing, however, is not ideal, given we are two years into a U.S. SPAC boom that many commentators feel already has too much money chasing too few viable targets.""
Earlier on Tuesday, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which includes national regulators like the FCA and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said it has created a group to monitor SPACs.
""While SPACs may offer alternative sources of funding and provide opportunities for investors, they may also raise regulatory concerns,"" IOSCO said in a statement.
LONDON PIPELINE
The EU's European Securities and Markets Authority earlier this month set out detailed guidance on what SPACs should tell investors about risks, business strategy and criteria for selecting target companies.
In the United States, the SEC has ramped up an inquiry into blank check acquisitions, homing in on potential conflicts of interest created when banks act as underwriters and advisers on the same deal, sources have told Reuters.
While the SPAC frenzy has peaked in the United States, bankers told Reuters that they expect around 30-40 blank cheque vehicles to launch in Europe in the second half of the year, with up to 15 of them choosing London after the new rules come into effect. 
SPAC veterans Chamath Palihapitiya and Ian Osborne are said to be looking at teaming up for a blank cheque foray in London, sources familiar with the situation said.
Several other private equity firms and corporates are also considering SPAC listings in London and elsewhere in Europe, bankers said. 

""The FCA appears to have struck the right balance between protecting investors and making the London Stock Exchange more competitive,"" said Delphine Currie, a partner at law firm Reed Smith. ""Today’s announcement could be the moment that kick-starts SPAC listings in the UK.""

A group of 200,000 Brazilian claimants have been pushing to resurrect the 5 billion pound ($6.9 billion) English lawsuit against BHP since a lower court struck out the lawsuit case as an abuse of process last November and a Court of Appeal judge upheld that decision in March.
""Whilst we fully understand the considerations that led the judge to his conclusion that the claim should be struck out, we nevertheless believe that the appeal has a real prospect of success,"" three Appeal Court judges said in Tuesday's ruling.
The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and obliterated villages as a torrent of more than 40 million cubic metres of mining waste swept into the Doce river, reaching the Atlantic Ocean, over 650 km (400 miles) away.
Hundreds of thousands of people suffered losses.
The group claim - one of the largest in English legal history - has been brought by law firm PGMBM on behalf of Brazilian individuals, businesses, churches, organisations, municipalities and indigenous people.
Tom Goodhead, a PGMBM managing partner, said it was a ""monumental judgement"" and that his clients felt this was the first time judges had recognised the importance of the case.

BHP, the world's largest mining company by market value, has labelled the case pointless and wasteful, alleging it duplicates proceedings in Brazil and the work of the Renova Foundation, an entity created by the company and its Brazilian partners to manage reparations and repairs.
""BHP’s position remains that the proceedings do not belong in the UK,"" it said in a statement. ""Issues brought by the claimants are already covered by the work of the Renova Foundation, by existing decisions of the Brazilian Courts or are the subject of ongoing legal proceedings in Brazil.""

China’s top food delivery company slid a record 18% Tuesday in Hong Kong, on top of a 14% plummet the previous day. Spreads on Meituan’s dollar bond due 2030 rose 16 basis points to 232 basis points, set for the widest on record, Bloomberg-compiled data showed.
The Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) backed company, already the target of an antitrust probe with uncertain outcomes, was among the biggest losers in an accelerating selloff that convulsed internet stocks after China ordered swathes of its $100 billion private education sector to go non-profit.
The clampdown on the booming industry shocked seasoned China watchers, prompting a rethink of how far Xi Jinping’s Communist Party is willing to go as it tightens its grip on the private economy. Meituan’s losses deepened after the nation’s powerful antitrust watchdog posted rules late on Monday ordering online food platforms to ensure their workers earn at least the local minimum wage, which appeared to target the sector’s leader.
The guidelines weren’t a surprise but the timing of their announcement was,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Alicia Yap wrote. “We do see risks of slower profit growth and push out of near-term margins.”

Investors fled Chinese tech stocks, bonds and currencies Tuesday as a post-crackdown rout expanded. Meituan’s stock has tumbled more than 50% from its peak in February as the company grapples with scrutiny on multiple fronts. The food industry regulations added to a litany of regulatory woes.
Beijing announced an investigation in April into whether Meituan violated anti-monopoly laws through practices such as forced exclusivity arrangements with restaurants. The company’s also drawn criticism over the way it treats hundreds of thousands of low-income delivery riders, who were put to the test during the pandemic. And Chief Executive Officer Wang Xing himself has been warned to keep a low profile, Bloomberg News has reported, after the founder posted a controversial poem that convulsed markets and sparked a social media furor.

Wang has detailed plans to address government concerns about its business practices. Among other things, the company has pledged to work with regulators and improve its compliance standards. It also promised to provide insurance for millions of its delivery drivers -- many of them work as part-time personnel and lack proper employee benefits -- and has started to reform its commissions scheme in a move to cut fees for partner restaurants.
Some analysts cautioned this week’s selloff was overdone.
“We view share price pullback about guidelines details as overdone,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Thomas Chong wrote. “Flexible worker protection is not new to market. Since 2020, Meituan organized about 100 sessions with riders and launched enhancement measures based on the feedback.”

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>","Apple's iPhone expected to drive sales, but App Store faces regulatory risk","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Strong sales of 5G iPhones and services such as the App Store and Apple Music are expected to drive growth at Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which reports results on Tuesday, but some investors will be listening to the company's strategy to ward off anti-trust foes.
The services business faces lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny, including from an empowered U.S. Department of Justice, and a raft of pending legislation in the United States and Europe to lower its commissions on apps and make other changes.
""We believe government action (via antitrust, executive order, and legislation) represents the single greatest risk for shares of Apple,"" Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co, wrote in a note to clients, adding that he hoped Apple's executives would address the risks on the company's earnings call on Tuesday.
Analysts expect Apple's services sales to rise 24.1% to $16.33 billion, more than a fifth of its expected overall sales of $73.30 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of July 26.
Last year, when ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games sued Apple over its App Store commissions, Cowen & Co analyst Krish Sankar estimated that Apple's App Store provides about 6% of its overall revenues and between 10% and 15% of its profits.
Apple also faces the risk that the U.S. Department of Justice could bar Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google paying to be the default search engine on the iPhone, Angelo Zino of CFRA Research wrote in a research note last week. Justice Department officials have cited estimates that Google pays Apple $8 billion to $12 billion per year.

For now, analysts expect the company to see a boom in iPhone sales for its fiscal third quarter, with sales rising 28.7% to $34 billion, according to Refinitiv data as of July 26, by far the largest single contributor to sales.
J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note last week that Apple's services business growth has driven a structural shift a higher valuation for the company, with shares trading near 30 times earnings. As recently as 2019, shares consistently traded at less than 20 times earnings as investors remained cautious about the company's heavy dependence on iPhone sales.

The Boston-based company said it expects 2021 free cash flow to be $3.5 billion to $5 billion, up from its prior forecast of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion.
It reported a free cash flow of $388 million in the quarter. That compared with Refinitiv's average analyst estimate of an outflow of $287 million, and following an outflow of $2.1 billion last year.
Free-cash flow is closely watched by investors as a sign of the health of GE's operations and ability to repay debt.
Shares surged 3.7% to $13.4 in premarket trading.
All of GE's industrial segments saw an improvement in profit margin in the latest quarter, with the aviation unit posting the biggest improvement. 
The aviation business, usually the company's cash cow, has been hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic as airlines cut back on flights and grounded aircraft.
GE said the business is showing ""early signs"" of recovery. 
A recovery in the aviation business is critical for Chief Executive Larry Culp to deliver $7 billion in free cash flow by 2023, which will provide greater resources to the company to invest in its businesses, pay a more competitive dividend and buy back shares.

Revenue rose to $18.28 billion from $16.81 billion in the quarter ended June 30.
GE reported adjusted profit of 5 cents per share for the quarter, compared with Refinitiv's average analyst estimate of a profit of 3 cents per share.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Tuesday, retreating from record highs ahead of the start of the latest Federal Reserve meeting and quarterly results from several massive tech tech companies.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 90 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.1%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures was flat.
The negative tone on Wall Street follows more heavy losses in Hong Kong earlier Tuesday, with the Hang Seng index falling more than 4%. The Chinese regulatory clampdown continued to pressurize the country’s tech companies and thus their American Depositary Receipts. All the major indices had closed at record highs on Monday.
Staying in the tech sector, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be in the spotlight after the electric car manufacturer released stronger second-quarter earnings after the close Monday. It reported quarterly net income of more than $1 billion for the first time even after taking an impairment of $23 million on account of its bitcoin holdings.
There are more influential earnings due after the close Tuesday from the tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), companies that have been behind a lot of the strong gains in the equity markets this year.
Additionally,  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) posted a 15% rise in quarterly revenue,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) lifted its free cash flow forecast for the year, citing a recovery in the aviation market, and 3M (NYSE:MMM), which reported a 17% rise in quarterly profit.
Aside from earnings, the Federal Reserve starts its latest two-day policy meeting later Tuesday. Investors will be looking for clues as to the thinking of the policymakers over when to start scaling back the central bank’s massive bond-buying program.
Tuesday’s major data release is the June durable goods orders release, at 8:30 AM ET, but there are also updates on national home prices and the monthly Conference Board consumer confidence survey. 
Elsewhere, oil prices stabilized Tuesday, following mixed news surrounding the Covid-19 virus, with the number of cases dropping in the U.K. and the Netherlands, but rising in the likes of France, Germany and the U.S..

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 07:01AM ET</span>","Google, Facebook set to squash initial iOS fears, show big revenue jump","By Nivedita Balu and Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Wall Street expects Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) to report a surge in digital ad sales this week after smaller rivals showed soaring demand, bolstering expectations that the impact of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes has not yet been felt.
Together, Google and Facebook generated about $70 billion in revenue last quarter through digital ads, a business that faced initial hits from the COVID-19 pandemic but which analysts said is now looking robust. 
Upbeat results from Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Twitter have been seen as positive indicators for the larger players due to report this week.
""The market is just too strong for Facebook to not have a good quarter,"" said Ygal Arounian, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities. 
Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney said Google's exposure to travel and small businesses such as physical stores would boost ad revenue both as re-opening continues and the online shopping trends that boomed during COVID is maintained.
Apple's privacy changes to its iOS operating software earlier this year, to ask users of each app for permission to track their activity, has raised concerns in the $100 billion mobile advertising market because opt-outs could restrict advertisers from accessing valuable data for targeting ads. Facebook has voiced loud opposition to the change.
However, analysts said the impact of the update, which was only rolled out in late April, on overall ad spend across Google and Facebook is unclear and should not have a major impact on this week's results. 
Mobile ad analyst Eric Seufert said he was mainly looking for guidance about what to expect in the third quarter.
Analysts and ad buyers also pointed out that the ""walled gardens"" of Facebook and Google, which are already rich in first-party data, could benefit from the privacy changes.
Simon Poulton, vice president of digital intelligence at WPromote, a digital marketing agency, highlighted Facebook's moves to increase commerce on its own platforms: ""Those are powerful things to be doing, because that's the ultimate place they want to play,"" he said. ""The less they have to rely on external eco-systems, the easier it is for them to showcase the actual value driven by the platform.""
THE CONTEXT 
Evercore ISI said data shows over 70% of iOS devices are using the most recent version of iOS as of late June. Of those, fewer than 33% of users have opted to allow tracking.
The brokerage cited data that showed client spend on iOS fell by about a third and spending on Android rose 10% in June.
And as the economy rebuilds after the blow from the pandemic last year, ad growth from brand advertising is strengthening, as also noted by Twitter and Snapchat.

(Reuters) - Gannett, the largest newspaper chain in the United States, is partnering with a sports betting company - the first deal of its kind for a major U.S. newspaper publisher. 
In a 5-year deal worth over $100 million, the publisher of USA Today, local papers published in 46 states and over 200 sports websites is teaming up with Tipico USA Technology, the American division of German sports betting provider Tipico Group.
Tipico will provide sports betting odds for Gannett’s sports content. Gannett will embed either a button or an icon for Tipico in its sport content and receive a referral fee for traffic that leads to first-time bettors on Tipico’s platform. Tipico will also spend $90 million on Gannett advertising and sponsored content, including videos, columns, blog posts and events. 
As more states have legalized sports betting, media companies have turned to the sector to diversify their revenue. In May the Associated Press struck a deal with sports betting company FanDuel, through which FanDuel pays the AP to include its sports odds in coverage. Both ViacomCBS-owned CBS Sports and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's ESPN have partnered with companies that provide sports betting odds. Fox Corp launched the FOX Bet sports betting platform in 2019 through a partnership with sports betting operator The Stars Group (NASDAQ:TSG_old). 
It is unclear what benefits these deals have yielded. Sun Bets, a partnership between the Rupert Murdoch-owned British newspaper The Sun, a unit of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), and Australian gambling group Tabcorp Holdings closed in 2018 after disappointing financial performance. 
Gannett had previously struck a deal with BetMGM in which the joint venture between MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and GVC Holdings paid Gannett for advertising and referrals. 

In an interview, Gannett Chief Executive Michael Reed said he hopes the Tipico deal will serve as a model for partnerships with other companies in sectors such as events and entertainment. “It's not an advertising play,” Reed said of the deal. “It’s building a new brand and customer base for a business that happens to be in a legalizing, fast-growing new business sector.”
In addition to the advertising and referral fees, Gannett will get a 1% equity stake in Tipico USA Technology upfront, with the option to acquire a total stake of 4.99% within the next five years.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s Flipkart has appealed to India's Supreme Court against a state court's decision that allowed an antitrust probe into the e-commerce firm and its rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) to continue, three sources told Reuters on Tuesday. 
The High Court in Karnataka state last week dismissed cases filed by Amazon and Flipkart which sought to quash the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) 2020 investigation. The companies denied any wrongdoing, but the court said ""they should not feel shy in facing an inquiry.""
On Tuesday, Flipkart filed an appeal in the Supreme Court, challenging that decision, three people familiar with the proceedings said.
Further details of the challenge, or Flipkart's pleas, were not immediately clear. The Supreme Court website showed Flipkart had filed a case against the CCI and other parties, without giving more details.
Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon is also expected to file an appeal against the high court ruling, according to people familiar with the case. 

The CCI investigation is the latest setback for Amazon and Flipkart, which are grappling with prospects of tougher e-commerce regulations and accusations from brick-and-mortar retailers that the companies circumvent Indian law by creating complex business structures.
The companies face several allegations in the case, including exclusive launches of mobile phones, promotion of select sellers on their websites and deep discounting practices that drive out competition.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 06:07AM ET</span>",McDonald's big sales growth expected as labor crunch looms,"By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's BTS celebrity meals and crispy chicken sandwiches are expected to fuel a U.S. sales increase of 24% when the company reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, but analysts are eyeing whether labor shortages could slow growth.
If results for McDonald's fall short of the mark, the lack of cooks and cashiers could be a culprit, along with competition from other restaurants reopening, independent analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note. 
As the United States and other economies move toward emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in demand for food and goods is exacerbating a shortage of servers, retail workers, truckers and delivery drivers. That crunch is causing slow service and menu outages.
McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski told investors in June that the competition for workers is likely to persist for some time, according to a transcript from a Bernstein conference.
To be sure, many fast-food chains have recovered to pre-pandemic sales levels and are expected to keep reporting strong earnings as customers use drive-thrus and digital apps to place contactless orders for quick family meals.
But some of McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD)'s franchisees are cutting operating hours because of staffing problems and seeing sales drop as competitors reopen, according to a survey by Kalinowski.
Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Inc said on Thursday that delays in delivery of equipment because of global supply chain logjams – as well as low staffing levels and construction and permitting delays – has slowed a number of new store openings.
Some analysts expect McDonald's U.S. sales to beat estimates, including Nick Setyan of Wedbush Securities, who pointed to new menu items such as the new line of chicken sandwiches, increased marketing spending and growing adoption of the company's app for ordering.
McDonald's also launched a new celebrity meal with the South Korean boy band BTS and gave away French fries on Fridays to app users that likely helped boost sales in the quarter.

International sales, which weighed on McDonald's global sales in recent quarters, may recover as COVID-19 cases fell in France, Germany, Canada, Spain and Italy and vaccination rates in some of those countries doubled, wrote Gordon Haskett analyst Jeff Farmer.
Analysts expect sales in those international operated markets to rise 65%, according to Refinitiv data from IBES.

1577,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",How China Evergrande's debt woes pose a systemic risk,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) -The financial troubles of China's most indebted property developer, China Evergrande Group, have raised fresh concerns about credit defaults in the country's highly-leveraged real estate sector and wider contagion.
The developer has not defaulted on interest payments but worries persist over its financial health as Beijing steps up curbs on the sector to contain bubble risks. Evergrande's shares have lost 65% since last September, when sources told Reuters it had asked the government for support to avoid a cash crunch.
S&P cut its ratings on Evergrande by two notches to B- from B+ on Monday, further weakening its funding access and raising doubts over its ability to reduce debt.
WHO IS EVERGRANDE? 
Founded in 1996 by Chairman Hui Ka Yan in the southern city of Guangzhou, Evergrande accelerated its growth in the past decade to become China's second-largest property developer with $110 billion in sales last year.
The company listed in Hong Kong in 2009, giving it more access to the capital and debt market to grow its asset size to $355 billion today. It has more than 1,300 developments across the nation, many in lower-tier cities. 
With national sales growth slowing in recent years, Evergrande has also been branching into businesses unrelated to real estate, such as electric cars, football, insurance and bottled water.
HOW DID CONCERNS ARISE OVER DEBT PILE?
Investors became worried after a leaked letter in September showed Evergrande had pleaded for government support to approve a now-dropped backdoor listing plan, warning it faced a cash crunch.
Concerns intensified after Evergrande admitted in June it did not pay some commercial paper on time, and news last week a Chinese court froze a $20 million bank deposit held by the firm on the request of Guangfa Bank.
Evergrande's fast expansion over the years has been fuelled by debt. It has been aggressively raising loans to support its land buying spree, and selling apartments quickly despite low margins so as to start the cycle again. 
The firm said its interest-bearing debt was at 570 billion yuan ($88.2 billion) at the end of June, down from a peak of 835.5 billion yuan a year earlier as it stepped up deleveraging efforts.
Total liability, which include payables, however, amounted to 1.95 trillion yuan at the end of 2020, accounting for 10.5% of the total liabilities of 45 property developers, ANZ estimated in a report.
Other than the usual bank and bond channels, the developer has been criticised for tapping the less regulated shadow banking market, including trusts, wealth management products and commercial paper.
WHAT EVERGRANDE HAS DONE TO DELEVERAGE?
Evergrande accelerated its efforts to reduce its debts last year after regulators introduced caps on three debt ratios dubbed ""the three red lines"" policy. It has said it aims to meet all the requirements by the end of next year. 
Evergrande has given buyers steep discounts for its residential developments and sold the bulk of its commercial properties to increase cashflow. Since the second half of 2020, it has had a $555 million secondary share sale, raising $1.8 billion by listing its property management unit in Hong Kong, while its EV unit sold a $3.4 billion stake to new investors. 
It unveiled plans earlier this year to spin off three unlisted units -- online real estate and automobile marketplace Fangchebao, and theme parks and spring water businesses -- to further release capital. Fangchebao has already raised $2.1 billion in a pre-IPO in March.
DOES EVERGRANDE POSE A RISK?
China's central bank highlighted in its financial stability report in 2018 that companies including Evergrande might pose systemic risks to the nation's financial system. 
Evergrande's liabilities involve more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions, according to the letter. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimated last week China Minsheng Bank has the highest exposure to Evergrande. 
Late payments could trigger cross-defaults as many financial institutions have exposure to Evergrande via direct loans and indirect holdings through different financial instruments.
In the dollar bond market, Evergrande accounts for 4% of Chinese real estate high-yields, according to DBS. Any defaults will also trigger sell-offs in the high-yield credit market.

A collapse of Evergrande will have a large impact on the job market. It has 200,000 staff and hires 3.8 million people every year for project developments.

1579,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 05:46AM ET</span>",Consumers' sweet tooth helps Lindt & Spruengli shine,"By Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH (Reuters) - Strong demand for Lindor and Excellence chocolates boosted sales and profit at Switzerland's Lindt & Spruengli in the first half, allowing it to raise its full-year guidance as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic waned.
The global chocolate confectionery market is still sluggish, but Lindt, whose organic sales dropped 6% last year, is now seeing demand for its upmarket chocolates recover due to continued investment in marketing and new products.
""Group sales have almost returned to their pre-COVID-19 trajectory,"" Chief Financial Officer Martin Hug told investors on a call on Tuesday.
He said the group had seen ""exceptional growth"" of 17.4% in the first half and gained market share in all its regions, with just its own stores and travel retail still below pre-pandemic levels.
Hug said growth would slow in the second half due to tougher comparisons, but was expected to be in the ""lower double-digit range"" for the full year, above previous guidance for 6-8% growth.
""We have benefited a lot from in-home consumption, now people will go out more,"" Hug said.
The group's participation certificates were up 3% at 0912 GMT, making it the best performer in a 0.6% weaker European food sector index. 
Analysts at Vontobel and Kepler Cheuvreux called the results ""mind-blowing"" and ""out of this world strong"".
Net profit hit a record for Lindt's traditionally weaker first half at 101.6 million Swiss francs ($110.9 million), fivefold the amount recorded in the year-ago period and almost twice as much as expected in a Refinitiv poll.

The Zurich-based company expects an operating margin ""at the upper end of 13%-14%"" this year in spite of higher packaging and staffing costs, Hug said.
Lindt confirmed its medium-term target of 5%-7% organic growth and an operating margin of 15% from 2022 onwards. It said its share buyback programme of up to 750 million francs was on track and set a goal to make all its packaging recyclable by 2025.

1580,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 05:35AM ET</span>",Tesla Gains as Results Show Dependence On Carbon Credits Falling,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was up more than 2% in Tuesday’s premarket trading as the company’s second-quarter results threw up not only $1.6 billion in adjusted profit but another pleasant surprise -  a falling reliance on selling carbon credits to make money.
The company made $354 million from selling environmental credits, 17% less than a year ago.
Tesla, being a manufacturer of electric vehicles and a contributor to the green energy ecosystem, earns regulatory carbon credits and sells these to other companies which rely on fossil fuels for their energy needs.
For many years, Tesla made good money from selling carbon credits. But as other companies also shift to renewable sources, they need to buy fewer of those credits from companies like Tesla. 
The share of revenue from carbon credit sales in Tesla’s total revenue more than halved to 3% in the June quarter from 7% a year ago.
Tesla’s automotive revenue almost doubled and income from operations soared more than four-fold, helped by record sales of its electric vehicles. The company delivered 201,250 vehicles during the quarter and upheld its full-year forecast despite the global chip shortage that has disrupted the plans of most automotive groups this year.
The company also took an impairment of $23 million on account of its Bitcoin holdings."
1581,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 05:31AM ET</span>",Bezos offers NASA $2 billion in exchange for moon mission contract,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) -Fresh off his trip to space, billionaire businessman Jeff Bezos on Monday offered to cover up to $2 billion in NASA costs if the U.S. space agency awards his company Blue Origin a contract to make a spacecraft designed to land astronauts back on the moon.
NASA in April awarded rival billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract to build a spacecraft to bring astronauts to the lunar surface as early as 2024, rejecting bids from Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics. Blue Origin had partnered with  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT),  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and Draper in the bid.
The space agency cited its own funding shortfalls, SpaceX's proven record of orbital missions and other factors in a contract decision that senior NASA official Kathy Lueders called ""what's the best value to the government.""
In a letter to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Bezos said Blue Origin would waive payments in the government's current fiscal year and the next ones after that up to $2 billion, and pay for an orbital mission to vet its technology. In exchange, Blue Origin would accept a firm, fixed-priced contract, and cover any system development cost overruns, Bezos said.
""NASA veered from its original dual-source acquisition strategy due to perceived near-term budgetary issues, and this offer removes that obstacle,"" Bezos wrote.
""Without competition, NASA's short-term and long-term lunar ambitions will be delayed, will ultimately cost more, and won't serve the national interest,"" Bezos added.
A NASA spokesperson said the agency was aware of Bezos' letter but declined to comment further, citing the protest Blue Origin filed with the U.S. Government Accountability Office accusing the agency of giving SpaceX an unfair advantage by allowing it to revise its pricing.
The GAO's decision is expected by early August, though industry sources said Blue Origin views the possibility of a reversal as unlikely.
A SpaceX spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Before choosing SpaceX, NASA had asked for proposals for a spacecraft that would carry astronauts to the lunar surface under its Artemis program to return humans to the moon for the first time since 1972. Blue Origin's lunar lander is called ""Blue Moon."" Bezos and Musk are the world's richest and third-richest people respectively, according to Forbes.
Bezos' offer came six days after he flew alongside three crewmates to the edge of space https://www.reuters.com/technology/jeff-bezos-worlds-richest-man-set-inaugural-space-voyage-2021-07-20 aboard Blue Origin's rocket-and-capsule New Shepard, a milestone for the company's bid to become a major player in an emerging space tourism market.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 05:11AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse investment bank set for Archegos aftershocks,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi, Oliver Hirt and Pamela Barbaglia
ZURICH (Reuters) - When  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) reports earnings on Thursday, investors will get an insight into how aftershocks from the Archegos and Greensill scandals are being felt across its investment bank just as its rivals are flourishing.
Credit Suisse's flagship wealth business is expected to ride the wave of frothy markets that has helped private bankers generate higher earnings off the rich.
But analysts expect a nearly $600 million hole caused by more losses on stricken fund Archegos and further weakness in its trading and advisory businesses to bring second-quarter net profit down to a quarter of its value a year ago.
That will mark a painful slide when competitors have felt the benefits of an economic recovery and a jump in dealmaking.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank has cut risk after its prime brokerage business lost more than any other competitor from the collapse of family office Archegos, and as its asset management division scrambles to return some $10 billion of client investments linked to insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill.
Those scandals have prompted a swathe of sackings, executive changes and regulatory investigations, while changes and bonus cuts at its investment bank have prompted an exodus of deal-makers, particularly in the United States.
Credit Suisse has lost more than 40 senior bankers in its advisory business, and a dozen senior bankers on the trading side, according to a tally of public reports by Reuters.
Credit Suisse declined comment.
The departures have been particularly focused in its M&A advisory business and across the United States and high-growth Asia.
Analysts on average expect that to translate to a 19% drop in second-quarter capital markets and advisory revenue, a notable contrast to competitors who have smashed profit estimates thanks to record M&A volumes.
Gains in investment banking helped main rival UBS to a 63% net profit jump, as Chief Executive Ralph Hamers pointed to the bank taking ""quite some market share"" over recent months.
Credit Suisse has slipped to seventh place in global M&A league tables, according to Refinitiv data to July 22, from sixth place in 2020, losing ground to European rival  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
In Europe, its second-quarter investment banking fees dropped to $214 million, the data shows, giving it a tenth placement in regional league tables, down from sixth place a year ago, when it earned $355 million in fees.
Smaller wealth management rival Julius Baer, meanwhile, unveiled plans to begin offering M&A advisory services to its clients as it posted record assets under management.
But not everyone expects the effects to show up already in the second quarter, at least in dealmaking.
""I don't think revenues will have disappeared two months after the event,"" Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti said, adding revenues are often booked later for deals that take months to arrange. ""It's a timing issue. I would definitely expect an impact, but rather in the second-half, from key people departing."" 
Venditti expects Credit Suisse's advisory revenues to increase this quarter, while he forecasts its equities trading business will show a drop more pronounced than peers.
SPAC SLIPPAGE
Even where staff have stayed put, Credit Suisse's investment bank has felt the impact of shifting relations.
Credit Suisse came to dominate the market for listing blank-cheque vehicles known as SPACS in 2020 through early ties it forged with ""SPAC king"" Chamath Palihapitiya. The bank acted as sole book-runner on all of his group Social Capital's previous listings.
Social Capital's SPACs accounted for roughly $3.66 billion of Credit Suisse's total SPAC volumes, around 29% of its total, in 2020, according to SPAC Research.
But whereas Credit Suisse dominated the top slot in SPAC underwriting in 2020, it now sits in third place behind  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), with half the market share it held in 2020.

And in June, Palihapitiya's Social Capital unveiled four new blank-check companies looking to raise a total of $800 million through initial public offerings, for which  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) would be acting as sole book runner. 
Social Capital declined comment.

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 04:16AM ET</span>",Christie's plans to expand Hong Kong galleries and salesrooms four-fold by 2024,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - British auction house Christie's said on Tuesday it plans to expand its physical presence in Hong Kong by 2024 with galleries and salerooms more than four times larger than it currently has, betting on a growing art market in the finance hub and in Asia. 
It will become the first anchor tenant in a new skyscraper in central Hong Kong, leasing a total of 50,000 square foot over four floors. The building, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects and developed by Henderson Land (OTC:HLDCY), is due for completion in 2023.
Christie's Asia Pacific president Francis Belin told reporters that around 30,000 square foot (2,787 square meters)will be used for galleries and salerooms, compared to 7,000 square foot in their current office.
""It's hard for us to extend the sales because we don't have the real estate to do so,"" Belin said. Christie's currently has to rent outside venues to hold large auctions and exhibitions. 
At its future headquarters, the auction house will be able to hold around six major all-week auction events a year, compared to only two currently that fall in Hong Kong's spring and autumn, he said.
Christie's $458 million in sales recorded in Hong Kong in May was the highest since 2013 and came as the financial hub recovered from a COVID-induced economic contraction last year. 
In the first half of 2021, Asia accounted for a record 39%, or over $1 billion, of global sales, up from 20-25% pre-pandemic, surpassing Europe and North America. 
""Hong Kong is the art centre,"" Belin said. ""Nothing has dented the confidence in the art market here.""
GlobalData’s Wealth Market Analytics expects the population of high net worth investors with liquid asset above $1 million in Hong Kong to rebound in 2021, and grow 12% to reach 243,320 individuals this year from 217,300 in pandemic-hit 2020. Hong Kong has a population of 7.5 million.
Belin said the expansion would not lead to aggressive hiring in addition to their 200 staff in Hong Kong. Christie's is also looking for bigger space to relocate in Shanghai. 
Christie's became the first major auction house to sell a digital artpiece that does not exist in physical form in March.
The artwork carried what is known as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), a unique digital token encrypted with the artist's signature and which verifies its ownership and authenticity and is permanently attached to the piece. 

Christie's sold close to $100 million of digital artwork in the first half of 2021, and Belin said such sales are bringing new and younger collectors to the auction house.

LONDON (Reuters) - Scotch whisky maker Glenfiddich has begun converting its delivery trucks to run on low-emission biogas made from waste products from its own whisky distilling process as part of a ""closed loop"" sustainability initiative, it said on Tuesday.
Glenfiddich said it has installed fueling stations at its Dufftown distillery in north-eastern Scotland that use technology developed by its parent company William Grant & Sons to convert its production waste and residues into an Ultra-Low Carbon Fuel (ULCF) gas that produces minimal carbon dioxide and other harmful emissions. 
Stuart Watts, distillery director at family-owned William Grant & Sons, said traditionally Glenfiddich has sold off spent grains left over from the malting process to be used for a high-protein cattle feed. 
But through anaerobic digestion - where bacteria break down organic matter producing biogas - the distillery can also use liquid waste from the process to make fuel and eventually recycle all of its waste products this way.
""The thought process behind this was 'what can we do that's better for us all?',"" Watts said.
The distiller, which sells more than 14 million bottles of single malt whisky a year, said its whisky waste-based biogas is already powering three specially-converted trucks that transport Glenfiddich spirit from production at Dufftown through to bottling and packaging, covering four William Grant & Sons sites in central and western Scotland.
Sixteenth century English chronicler Raphael Holinshed wrote that, consumed moderately, whisky's many medicinal benefits include preventing the ""head from whirling, the tongue from lisping ... the hands from shivering, the bones from aching."" 
But it turns out its waste products could also benefit the environment.
The distiller said the biogas cuts CO2 emissions by over 95% compared to diesel and other fossil fuels, and reduces other harmful particulates and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 99%.
Each truck will displace up to 250 tonnes of CO2 annually, Glenfiddich said.
The trucks Glenfiddich is using are converted vehicles from truckmaker Iveco that normally run on liquefied natural gas. 

Watts said Glenfiddich had a fleet of around 20 trucks and the technology could be applied throughout the delivery fleets of William Grant & Sons' whisky brands and could be scaled up to fuel other company's trucks. 
The Scottish whisky industry hopes to hit carbon net zero targets by 2040.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Tuesday, continuing to feel the backlash of China’s regulatory crackdown while the corporate earnings season continues in mixed fashion.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.9% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.7% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.9%.
The second-quarter corporate earnings season continues to dominate thinking in Europe, with a number of high-profile companies reporting results.
LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock rose 1.1% after the world's largest luxury goods group posted higher sales and profits, the sector recovering from the reopening of stores after the pandemic. Revenue for the first half was up over 11% from the comparable period in 2019, before the pandemic began.
Dassault Systemes (PA:DAST) stock rose 2.9% after the French software company lifted its 2021 outlook on surging software sales.
On the flip side,  Reckitt Benckiser  (LON:RKT) stock slumped 8.6% after the consumer goods company missed expectations for second-quarter sales, as demand eased for its hygiene products.
Sentiment in Europe was hit early after a largely negative handover from Asia, where several major Chinese tech stocks, listed in Hong Kong, remained under pressure on the back of regulatory fears surrounding China’s wider technology sector.
Investors will also await second-quarter results from the big tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) later Tuesday, given these companies have been behind a lot of the gains the major U.S. indices have registered for much of the last year. Late Monday, U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted strong results, recording over $1 billion income for the second quarter.
Also of interest will be the start of the latest Federal Reserve two-day policy meeting, which could see the U.S. central bank providing more information over the strength of the U.S. economy as well as its thinking over when it will start to scaling back its hefty asset-purchasing program.
The economic data slate is largely empty in Europe Tuesday, with the day’s major release being the U.S. durable goods number for June, which should confirm the country’s growing recovery.
Elsewhere, oil prices were largely unchanged Tuesday, as traders continue to weigh the tightening of restrictions in parts of Asia amid a Covid-19 resurgence with growing demand in the more vaccinated West. 
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
At 3:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $71.86 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $73.67.

(Reuters) -Reckitt Benckiser Group posted disappointing second-quarter sales growth and warned on margins on Tuesday sending its shares 9% lower as costs rise and easing lockdowns slow growth in products such as Lysol disinfectants.
Like-for-like sales rose 2.2% for the three months to June 30, excluding its infant nutrition business in China, lower than the 2.3% growth analysts had expected, according to a company-supplied consensus.
The stock, down 5% this year, was the top loser on the FTSE 100 index in morning trading. 
The pandemic boosted Reckitt's sales to record levels last year, but there are signs that momentum is easing as vaccinations gather pace and stay-at-home restrictions in developed economies are lifted. 
Reckitt said brands including Finish, Airwick, Harpic and Veet, which make up 70% of its sales, are growing, but at slower rates than last year, while brands like Durex, Vanish and Nurofen are returning to growth as market conditions normalise. 
Its hygiene business, which includes disinfectants and Finish dishwasher pods, saw like-for-like sales rise 7.8%, while its health business, which makes Mucinex cough syrup and Strepsils lozenges, fell 5.6%.
CEO Laxman Narasimhan said trends for its cold and flu products had improved in the second quarter.
Like its peers, the company saw costs rise for plastics and paper as well as higher freight and logistics costs. 
Cost of goods sold rose 8-9% in the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Carr said on a media call. 
The company now expects an adjusted operating margin 22.7% to 23.2% for 2021, lower than the 23.6% it generated in 2020. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the six months ended June came in at 142.6 pence, below the 144.4 pence average estimate. 

The company, which rebranded as Reckitt from RB earlier this year, maintained its full-year sales growth forecast of between 0% and 2%.
The company also reported an operating loss of 1.83 billion pounds in the first half of the year, mainly due to a nearly 3 billion pound charge taken on the sale of its infant nutrition business in China and a 165 million loss on the sale of Scholl - deals that were announced earlier this year.

LVMH shares were up 0.3% in early session trading.
""We are encouraged by Louis Vuitton and Dior's exceptional brand positioning across regions and sustained local luxury consumer demand,"" wrote brokerage Cowen & Company, which kept an 'outperform' rating on LVMH shares.
The luxury goods industry is recovering from the COVID-19 crisis, which shut down global travel and temporarily closed stores, and LVMH has benefited more than most, using its heft to spend on marketing and social media campaigns when some of its smaller rivals are still struggling to get back on their feet.
Overall sales at LVMH, which also owns champagne and cosmetics labels, rose by 84% year-on-year in the second quarter on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings, and stood at 14.7 billion euros ($17.33 billion).
Operating profit in the first six months of this year more than quadrupled compared with a year ago, beating expectations among analysts polled by Refinitiv.

""We think much of this will be repeated in H2 in the absence of a sector momentum shift: as long as the sector performs, LVMH will perform better,"" wrote brokerage Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), which kept a 'buy' rating on LVMH shares.

Beijing's crackdown on ed-tech and fin-tech among other things continues to reverberate. Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) falls in the likes of Meituan and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) dragged Asian shares to seven-month lows while U.S. and European markets are tipped to open lower and the yen is a touch firmer. 
A robust corporate second-quarter is mostly already in market prices. But after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s record results on Monday and with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reporting later on Tuesday, attention turns to what kind of outlook tech bosses will flag for a sector whose share performance has been pressured by economies reopening.
The question from markets seems to be ""Companies did great in Q2 but what's next?"" And the U.S. Treasury market isn't painting a pretty picture -- ""real"" bond yields are near record lows below minus 1%. 
Summer blues? COVID fatigue? Wait-and-see before Wednesday's Federal Reserve statement? Or is something being missed in the economic data?
U.S. home sales figures and Germany's Ifo disappointed on Monday but there's a solid 67% profit jump at Chinese industrial companies in June and the biggest quarterly GDP expansion in a decade in Korea on Tuesday. A Reuters poll of 500 economists upped global growth forecasts to 6% this year -- the fastest in nearly half a century -- and to 4.5% in 2022.
Even on the COVID front, there is a bright spot in Britain's steadily falling caseloads.
European earnings are seeing some nice beats from staffing group Randstadt, chocolatier Lindt, wealth manager Vontobel. Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI), which makes computer mice and keyboards, posted a 66% Q2 profit leap and said it continued to see huge demand from stay-at-home workers. 
Finally, Bitcoin which rallied to five-week highs on Monday has stumbled again and is back below $40,000.

1593,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 02:02AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Lower; Major Tech Earnings Due,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally lower Tuesday, continuing to feel the backlash of China’s regulatory crackdown ahead of the start of a Federal Reserve meeting and major tech earnings.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.2%.
European equities are set to receive a largely negative handover from Asia, where several major Chinese tech stocks, listed in Hong Kong, stayed under pressure for the third day on the back of regulatory fears surrounding China’s wider technology sector.
Additionally, profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed for the fourth straight month in June, rising 20% compared with 36.4% growth in May, as high raw material prices weighed on factories' margins.
However, losses are likely to be limited with investors studying strong second-quarter results from U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ahead of results from the big tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) later Tuesday. These companies have been behind a lot of the gains the major U.S. indices have registered for much of the last year.
Also of interest will be the start of the latest Federal Reserve two-day policy meeting, which could see the U.S. central bank providing more information over the strength of the U.S. economy as well as its thinking over when it will start to scaling back its hefty asset-purchasing program.
Back in Europe,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has appointed former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) employee David Wildermuth as its new chief risk officer in the wake of the Archegos and Greensill scandals.
In the U.K., the day's big earnings release was  Reckitt Benckiser  (LON:RKT), which reported a hefty net loss as it sold its IFCN business in China. The company also warned of rising cost pressures but upheld its full-year target for revenue growth.
The economic data slate is largely empty in Europe Tuesday, with the day’s major release being the U.S. durable goods number for June, which should confirm the country’s growing recovery.
Elsewhere, oil prices rose Tuesday, rebounding after Monday’s losses with investors remaining confident over the prospects for global demand recovery even as some countries tighten restrictions amid a Covid-19 resurgence. 
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $72.16 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $73.96.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,795.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1797.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse on Tuesday appointed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' David Wildermuth as its new chief risk officer, as it seeks to turn the corner on the Archegos and Greensill scandals that have rocked Switzerland's second-biggest bank.
""I am delighted to welcome David to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), where he will help shape the Group's enhanced risk management framework, an essential part of the bank's strategic realignment currently underway,"" Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio said in a statement.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank has cut risk after its prime brokerage business lost more than any other competitor from the collapse of family office Archegos, and as its asset management division scrambles to return some $10 billion of client investments linked to insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill.
Those scandals have prompted a swathe of sackings, executive changes and regulatory investigations, as well as a planned strategic overhaul which Horta-Osorio has said is to place risk and cultural change as a top priority.
Former Chief Risk and Compliance Officer Lara Warner was one of the high-level casualties, replaced on an interim basis by Joachim Oechslin, who the bank said will resume his role as strategic advisor to the CEO.
Wildermuth, a 24-year veteran of the U.S. financial giant, was appointed deputy chief risk officer at Goldman Sachs in 2015 and has been a partner since 2010.

""David joins with an impressive track record, underlining our firm commitment to further enhance our risk management across the bank,"" Credit Suisse CEO Thomas Gottstein said in the statement. ""He is the right person to lead and further strengthen our risk organization.""
Wildermuth will assume the role on February 1, 2022 at the latest, the Swiss bank said.

More than 95% of the 120,000-plus votes submitted were in favor of the plan, Purdue said, citing preliminary voting results.
Purdue expects to release the final voting results by Aug. 2, but added that it does not expect any material changes.
Purdue's plan aims to resolve some 3,000 lawsuits brought by U.S. communities alleging that Purdue and its wealthy Sackler family owners contributed to the opioid crisis that has claimed the lives of roughly 500,000 people since 1999, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Stamford, Connecticut-based company and family members have denied the allegations in the litigation.
Earlier in July, Purdue reached an agreement with several states over the litigation.
The agreement, supported by longstanding holdouts including Massachusetts and New York, sets the stage for Purdue to gain court approval in coming weeks for its bankruptcy plan, which the company values at more than $10 billion. 
That value is contingent in part on future donations of overdose reversal and addiction treatment medications the company has under development.

The plan would dissolve the company and shift assets to trusts run on behalf of the plaintiffs that alleged the company and its owners aggressively marketed the painkiller OxyContin while playing down its abuse and overdose risks.
If approved, it would also include legal releases that shields the Sacklers from future litigation.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, making modest gains as the session opened. Chinese and Hong Kong shares seemed to stabilize from their steep losses during the previous day, while their U.S. counterparts closed the previous session with a fresh record.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 were up 0.53% by 10:16 PM ET (2:16 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.71%. Korea’s GDP grew 5.9% year-on-year and 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter of 2021, according to data released earlier in the day.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.45%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.66%. China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.22% while the ShenzhenComponent was up 0.48%.
U.S. shares closed at a fresh record as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) became the latest company to report its results, which were better than expected. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  . (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are among the companies to report their earnings later in the week.
U.S. Treasuries steadied, with the real yield on the benchmark 10-year debt tumbling to a record low as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to hand down its latest policy decision. Officials are expected to discuss an eventual asset tapering in their two-day meeting, which starts later in the day, ahead of handing the decision down on Wednesday.
“It’s profits and the Fed. The next couple of days are going to be monumental as everyone tries to figure out how strong corporate fundamentals are at the moment and in what context that is happening in terms of the economic outlook and policy settings,” IG Markets market analyst Kyle Rodda told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index that tracks 98 of China’s biggest firms listed in the U.S. recorded its biggest two-day drop since 2008. The impact of the Chinese clampdown on sectors including technology, education and real estate continue to felt as the country tightens its grip on the economy. With investors left wondering which sectors could be next, the resultant selloff in Chinese shares will increase the probability of wider risk aversion.
However, strong corporate profits and the uneven but steady COVID-19 recovery in the most-vaccinated nations continued to brighten the overall outlook. The spread of COVID-19 cases involving the Delta variant remains a concern and that the economic recovery from COVID-19 could be peaking.
The Fed meeting and policy decision could also provide clues as to how inflationary pressures will shape the monetary policy outlook.
“Equity markets have oscillated between inflation and growth fears, which should not coexist,” Natixis Investment Managers Solutions head of global market strategy Esty Dwek said in a note. Although “growth will hold up, the reopening will last and the Fed will err on the side of caution and maintain its accommodative stance,” volatility also lies ahead, the note added.
Also on investors’ radars is U.S. second-quarter GDP data, due on Thursday.
Volatility also continued in cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin topping the $40,000 mark before paring those gains to trade above $37,000."
1600,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 10:00PM ET</span>",Evergrande Decides Against Special Dividend in Surprise Move,"(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande Group surprisingly decided against declaring a special dividend after investors were spooked by news that banks and ratings companies are growing wary of the debt-laden developer.
The board chose to cancel the proposal less than two weeks after flagging it to investors. It took into consideration the current market environment, the rights of shareholders and creditors, and the long-term development of businesses, according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday.
Led by Chairman Hui Ka Yan, the world’s most indebted developer has been trying to convince bond and stock holders that it has ample ammunition to make good on its borrowings, while also countering short-sellers. Its credit rating was cut by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings late Monday, the third downgrade by a global firm in about a month.
The decision to forgo the shareholder reward confounded analysts who had reckoned Evergrande may take one of three routes: a cash payment, a stock dividend or handing out shares in its higher-value listed subsidiaries.
“It’s clearly negative for equity holders,” said Eddie Chia, a portfolio manager at China Life Franklin. “However, saying and not doing something might spook some bond investors, even though it’s relatively neutral given there is no asset or dividend leakage.”
Shares of Evergrande fell as much as 9.1% on Tuesday morning in Hong Kong. The stock has dropped 59% this year.
Its bond due 2025 was indicated down after falling 1.5 cents on the dollar to 51.7 cents the previous day, Bloomberg-compiled data show.
Evergrande said on July 15 that its board would discuss the special dividend, after the stock slumped 48% from a January high. The announcement briefly triggered a spike in the shares that was erased as investor doubts over the troubled developer turned into panic.
Markets were spooked last week by a loan dispute the developer had with Guangfa Bank, which led to the freezing of a $20 million deposit held by Evergrande’s main onshore subsidiary. The incident, which was later resolved, pointed to “the fragility of the company’s funding situation,” S&P said, lowering the credit rating by two notches. S&P also cited margin erosion as the developer resorts to aggressive price promotions to accelerate sales.
The investor rout deepened after a Chinese city last week halted its sales at two residential projects and alleged Evergrande didn’t properly use funds, before a quick resolution the next day.
On top of that, at least four of Hong Kong’s largest lenders stopped providing mortgages to buyers of Evergrande’s unfinished apartments in the city. At least two of them are reconsidering the halts after their decisions were questioned by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Bloomberg reported.
The last time Evergrande doled out a special dividend, in 2018, its earnings were soaring, though bearish bets abounded then too. It has since seen annual profit drops for 2019 and 2020, with total liabilities swelling to $301 billion.

The S&P 500 rose 0.24%, to close at a record high of 4,422. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.24%, or 82 points to close a record of 35,144.12. The Nasdaq closed at record of 14,840.70.
Large cap tech stocks were mostly positive as investors piled into the sector, which has gained about 14% since its May slump, ahead of quarterly results from the Fab 5 due this week. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report quarterly results on Tuesday, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) deliver results  on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.
The broader market was lifted by a climb in energy stocks as oil prices recovered some losses from the lows of the day.
Oil prices were steady on Monday as the spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant stoked fears over future fuel demand, though crude supply looks set to be tight through the rest of the year.
As well as earnings, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision and commentary from Fed chairman Jerome Powell are also likely to drive market action later this week.
“[T]he Fed is scheduled to meet, releasing its latest policy decision on Wednesday. Rates are largely expected to remain unchanged at 0.00%-0.025%. The Committee’s asset purchase program is also expected to remain steady at $120 billion. The highlights, therefore, will come from the statement as well as the press conference,” Stifel said in a note.
With stocks hovering at record highs, some on Wall Street see wild swings coming for the broader market, but ultimately continue to back the bull market.
“Higher inflation, rising interest rates, and a less accommodative Federal Reserve could lead to short-term market volatility, but we expect the bull market to remain intact,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.

Investing.com - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported Monday blowout second-quarter earnings as record deliveries and cost-cutting measures bolstered results.
Tesla shares gained 3.5% in after-hours trade following the report.
Tesla announced earnings per share of $1.45 on revenue of $11.96 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 93 cents on revenue of $11.53 billion.
Regulatory credit revenue fell 17% to $354 million.
Earlier this month, Tesla reported deliveries of 201,250 electric vehicles, and production of 206,421 total vehicles, during the quarter ending June 30.
Vehicle average selling price declined by 2% year-on-year, but automotive margins continued to improve, rising to 28.4% in Q2 from 26.5% in Q1, and up 298 basis points from the same period a year earlier.
""In the second quarter of 2021, we broke new and notable records. We produced and delivered over 200,000 vehicles, achieved an operating margin of 11.0% and exceeded $1B of GAAP net income for the first time in our history,"" the company said.
The company's foray into bitcoin proved a drag in the second-quarter, as the slump in the price of the popular crypto since its May record high, led to $23 billion impairment.
Tesla flagged the ongoing shortage in chip supply during the quarter. ""Supply chain challenges, in particular global semiconductor shortages and port congestion, continued to be present in Q2.""
Looking ahead, component supply will take added importance at time when EV demand remains at record levels. ""With global vehicle demand at record levels, component supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for the rest of this year,"" Tesla added.
A slew of headwinds including increasing electric vehicle competition, China safety issues negatively impacting demand, and the chip shortage have weighed on the share price this year, Wedbush said ahead of the Tesla's quarterly report. ""With all of these headwinds, Tesla still impressively hit 200k+ deliveries in the June quarter and appear to be on a trajectory to possibly hit 900k for the year with a stronger 2H on the horizon in our opinion.""

As such, Wall Street analysts expect investors to invest heavily in infrastructure stocks Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO),  Astec Industries  (NASDAQ:ASTE), and Columbus McKinnon (CMCO), given their immense long-term growth potential. They believe this will facilitate a 40%-plus gain in their share prices in the near term. Read on.A highly anticipated $1.20 trillion infrastructure stimulus package is currently being debated in Congress. Despite a recent setback when the bill failed to secure votes in the Senate, 22 Democratic and Republican senators expect to release an approved package soon. Approximately $579 billion of the total stimulus package is expected to fund the construction of roads, bridges, and broadband infrastructure nationwide.
In addition, President Biden has floated a $3.50 trillion budget resolution bill proposal that focuses on social and environmental factors, including hefty investments in the clean energy space, which was previously cut from the infrastructure package. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer expects this budget blueprint to “allow us to pass the most significant legislation to expand, support and help American families since the New Deal...This is generational, transformational change to help American families who need the help in this rapidly changing world.”

Investing.com – The S&P 500 hovered at record highs Monday, ahead of a busy week of earnings from big tech and a monetary policy update from the Federal Reserve due later this week.
The S&P 500 rose 0.2%, after hitting a record high of 4,420.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%, or 63 points, though had notched a intraday record of 35,135.97. The Nasdaq also remained close to its record high of 14,863.6.
Large cap tech stocks were mostly positive as investors piled into the sector, which has gained about 14% since its May slump, ahead of quarterly results from the Fab 5 due this week. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report quarterly results on Tuesday, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) deliver results  on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), up more than 2%, is set to report second-quarter results after the closing bell on Monday. Earlier this month, the company said it produced and delivered over 200,000 vehicles for the quarter.  
Ahead of the report, Tesla shares have underperformed, weighed down by a myriad of headwinds including “increasing EV competition, China PR/safety issues negatively impacting demand, and the chip shortage overhang,” Wedbush said. Tesla, however, still notched 200,000 deliveries in the June quarter and appears to “be on a trajectory to possibly hit 900k for the year with a stronger 2H on the horizon in our opinion.” 
The broader market was lifted by a climb in energy stocks as oil prices recovered some losses from the lows of the day.
Oil prices were steady on Monday as the spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant stoked fears over future fuel demand, though crude supply looks set to be tight through the rest of the year.
As well as earnings, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision and commentary from Fed chairman Jerome Powell are also likely to drive market action later this week.
“[T]he Fed is scheduled to meet, releasing its latest policy decision on Wednesday. Rates are largely expected to remain unchanged at 0.00%-0.025%. The Committee’s asset purchase program is also expected to remain steady at $120 billion.

With stocks hovering at record highs, some on Wall Street see wild swings coming for the broader market, but ultimately continue to back the bull market.
“Higher inflation, rising interest rates, and a less accommodative Federal Reserve could lead to short-term market volatility, but we expect the bull market to remain intact,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -German real estate company Vonovia is expected to launch a fresh attempt to buy rival Deutsche Wohnen (OTC:DTCWY) within weeks, having so far failed to secure sufficient shareholder backing, people close to the matter told Reuters.
Vonovia on Monday said Deutsche Wohnen shareholders had tendered 47.62% of the target's equity in favour of the 18.7 billion euros ($22 billion) offer, missing the required 50% threshold by last Wednesday's deadline. 
""The CEOs of both companies still want the deal and they are looking to find a solution,"" one of the sources said, while another said any new offer would be launched only after Vonovia's supervisory board had analysed the matter and signed off on it.
Both Vonovia and Deutsche Wohnen declined to comment.
Vonovia failed to secure the deal for a number of reasons, with some shareholders declining to tender their shares on a view that the offer undervalued Deutsche Wohnen. 
""Vonovia has offered a purchase price of 52 euros per share. I consider this to be significantly too low and therefore absolutely unacceptable"", Michael Muders, portfolio manager at Union Investment - which holds more than 2% of DW - told German business weekly Wirtschaftswoche. 
A number of hedge funds tendered none or only a small amount of their holdings in anticipation of getting more for their shares at a later stage, while index funds holding about 20% of DW shares are able to tender their shares only after the minimum acceptance quota has been reached, according to their own rules. 
Vonovia had also agreed with Deutsche Wohnen that the latter would not tender its roughly 4% in treasury shares, to make the deal cheaper. 
With Vonovia failing to win over enough Deutsche Wohnen shareholders, any improvement in its offer might be a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, a person close to the matter said. 
""Now that the wheels have come off, it will be cumbersome and expensive to get them back on"", the person said.
Under German law, if a target company agrees and German financial watchdog Bafin issues a waiver, a potential buyer can make a new approach immediately after a failed offer without having to wait for 12 months, with such a waiver seen as little more than a formality. 
The deal would create a property giant with 550,000 apartments, but has been the centre of heated debate in Germany amid tensions over soaring rents ahead of general elections in September. 

Vonovia had failed in a 2016 takeover attempt but this time Deutsche Wohnen's CEO favours the deal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. weapons maker  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) said on Monday its space business boosted revenues in the latest quarter, but a classified aeronautics development program caused the company to miss analysts' profit estimate, sending shares down 3.2% in early trading.Lockheed's second-quarter earnings report comes a year after the global pandemic first hit the defense industry and its supply chain, causing shutdowns, shortages and months of delays. 
Fresh support for the industry came last week when the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate's Armed Services Committee rolled out a draft of its 2022 defense budget which boosted spending by $25 billion, potentially benefiting defense companies including Lockheed Martin, and signaling defense spending could rise under President Joe Biden.
Lockheed increased its guidance for full-year earnings per share.
Quarterly sales at Lockheed's largest unit, aeronautics - which makes the F-35 fighter jet, rose 2.5% to $6.6 billion. 
But ""performance issues"" at aeronautics in the quarter led to a loss of $225 million on ""a highly classified program that Lockheed Martin has been working on for a couple of years,"" Ken Possenriede, Lockheed's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview.
Lockheed posted $6.52 in earnings per diluted share for the quarter. Without the $225 million loss, earning per share would have been $0.61 cents higher, according to the results.
Analysts on average expected the company to report quarterly earnings of $6.53 per share, according to Refinitiv data. 
In its sales outlook for the year, Lockheed trimmed the aeronautics segment by $175 million, but increased its outlook for sales by the same figure across the Rotary and Mission Systems unit and Space unit.

The space unit saw its profits in the quarter increase to $335 million, a jump of 33%, due to progress on space based sensor platforms and its United Launch Alliance investment. 
Lockheed's second-quarter revenue was $17 billion. Analysts had estimated a revenue of $16.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A disbarred American lawyer, who spent more than two decades battling  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) over pollution in the Ecuadorian rainforest, was found guilty on Monday of criminal contempt charges stemming from a lawsuit brought by the oil company.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan ruled that Steven Donziger ""repeatedly and willfully"" defied court orders, including by failing to turn over his computer, phones and other electronic devices.
Monday's ruling followed a five-day trial held in May with no jury.
Martin Garbus, a lawyer for Donziger, said he expected the decision to be reversed on appeal. 
Lawyers for the prosecution and Chevron representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Donziger has previously said the charges violated his rights to due process under the U.S. Constitution.
The contempt case is the latest twist in a long-running battle stemming from Donziger's representation of villagers in Ecuador's Lago Agrio region, who sought to hold Chevron liable for water and soil contamination in the jungle between 1964 and 1992. 
Chevron has said Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron, cleaned up the pollution and state-owned Petroecuador was mainly responsible for the contamination.
Donziger won a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in an Ecuadorian court in 2011. But the company sued Donziger in Manhattan federal court later that year, claiming he and his associates pressured the presiding judge in Ecuador.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in 2014 ruled in favor of Chevron, saying the Ecuadorian judgment had been secured through bribery, fraud and extortion.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 11:16AM ET</span>","Exclusive-Italy shelves insurance plan for MPS legal risks, eyes spin-off - sources","By Giuseppe Fonte and Valentina Za
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Treasury is exploring a plan to hive off most of the legal risks weighing on Monte dei Paschi after shelving an alternative insurance scheme that was too costly, three sources close to the matter said.
Legal risks of around 10 billion euros have long posed one of the main hurdles to Italy's efforts to cut the 64% stake the state owns in Monte dei Paschi (MPS) after a 2017 bailout.
The absence of a firm solution to the legal problems threatens to further prolong the Treasury's struggle to return MPS to private hands.
The government of Prime Minister Mario Draghi is under pressure to find a solution for MPS, which needs more capital only four years after its 5.4 billion euro state bailout.
After months of tense negotiations, MPS last week signed a draft accord with its former top investor, local banking foundation Fondazione Monte dei Paschi, to settle their outstanding legal disputes.
The landmark deal will reduce claims by 3.8 billion euros. The Treasury is working to further lower remaining legal risks below 5 billion euros, sources have said.
But even after cutting the claims, the three sources said a scheme the Treasury has been working on for months to allow MPS to insure its legal risks and make it easier to find a buyer is too costly for the Tuscan bank's weakened finances.
Under the scheme, state-owned exports insurance agency SACE and other private players would have provided protection for the risks against the payment of fees.
The scheme, however, also failed to solve another key problem: the joint liability MPS and its acquirer would remain subject to under Italian law vis-à-vis potential plaintiffs.
The Treasury has now revived an earlier plan that entailed spinning off MPS' legal risks and keeping them in state hands, a move that needs clearance from European Union competition authorities, the sources said.
Deliberations are still preliminary and a decision on how to proceed can only be taken in agreement with MPS' buyer, one of the sources said, adding that if Rome opted for the spin-off scheme it would be a long and complex process.
MPS declined to comment.
The Treasury has been trying to convince UniCredit to take on its ailing rival but Italy's number 2 bank is focused on an internal revamp under new CEO Andrea Orcel.
Banking stress test results on Friday are expected to highlight MPS' vulnerability, though a person familiar with the matter said capital needs should not exceed the 2.5 billion euros MPS has already said it plans to raise by mid-2022.
The government faces calls to delay the sale by the co-ruling 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League party, lawmakers say.
Union representatives staged a protest in Rome on Monday calling for safeguards for MPS workers.

On Tuesday, Deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli will speak about the Treasury's re-privatisation plans before a parliamentary committee conducting an inquiry into the banking system under the leadership of 5-Star MP Carla Ruocco. 
The Treasury is working with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Orrick to re-privatise MPS. Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are advising MPS.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 11:02AM ET</span>",Analysis-Cash-hungry emerging markets arrive late to the SPAC party,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Emerging markets have so far been on the fringes of a fundraising boom using so-called SPACs or special-purpose acquisition companies, which could potentially unlock a vital new source of cash for entrepreneurs in developing regions.
But the take-off of SPAC fundraisings in these markets hinges in part on the success of a few recently-delayed landmark deals, reflecting wider global investor caution about this funding tool.
SPACs allow investors to list a shell company on public markets before they have identified a business to buy, which provides a speedier route to an initial public offering. 
In excess of $115.6 billion has been raised via more than 400 SPACS or blank-check companies this year, mainly on Wall Street where SPACs make up two thirds of all Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), although activity has slowed as regulatory and valuation concerns have increased.
In contrast, a total of $1.18 billion has been raised this year via six SPACs by emerging market issuers, including two apiece from Israel and China. This is just a fraction of the $96.3 billion raised via traditional IPOs from emerging markets, based on Refinitiv data.
But SPACs are expected to feature more prominently in future fundraisings for emerging market entrepreneurs, opening up more capital and operational expertise.
Just this month, SPACs formed by Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Capital and Singapore's Fat Projects Spac filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $300 million in IPOs.
The former is targeting media and entertainment, highlighting growth opportunities in emerging markets such as India and China, while the latter's focus includes businesses cashing in on Southeast Asia's booming consumer market.
For investors, emerging market SPACs can offer high returns, but also greater potential risks related to transparency and disclosure. All eyes are on the fate of the emerging market deals already underway.
Singapore's Grab, going public through a SPAC merger worth $40 billion, said last month it expected to complete the deal during the fourth quarter. The company had previously said it aimed to close the deal by July. 
""Assuming Grab does well, people are going to pay attention to that,"" said Allen Taylor, managing director of California-based venture capital firm Endeavor Catalyst, an investor in more than 180 emerging market portfolio companies.
He said entrepreneurs and investors in Southeast Asia will see this as a credible option for how to go public.
""More people will follow and I think the same is true for Latin America as those are the two regions I'm most bullish on."" 
Brazilian planemaker Embraer said in June its subsidiary Eve, which develops aircraft in the electric vertical take-off and landing business, had entered into a SPAC deal. Analysts estimated Eve could reach a market value of $2 billion.
Abu Dhabi-based music streaming app Anghami said in March it would become the first Arab tech company to list on the Nasdaq after agreeing to merge with a SPAC vehicle in a deal that was expected to close in the second quarter.
But one banker who covers the region said the small size of the listing for New York - Anghami's deal implies an enterprise value of about $220 million - had prompted concern from some SPAC-watchers about its outcome. 
Anghami said in response to Reuters questions on the timing and progress of the deal: ""The SPAC merger process has a number of technical milestones that must be met before completion...We have been working towards completion but these processes invariably take some time.""
Anghami said it looked forward to completing the remaining steps in the process to make the group the first Arab tech company to list on Nasdaq in New York.
Reflecting cautious investor sentiment towards SPACs, share prices of the vehicles merging with Grab and Anghami have both fallen from the levels they were at when the deals were announced.

'ONE ARROW IN THE QUIVER'
Emerging markets urgently need more fundraising options. Currently these markets only account for around 8% of private capital and 11% of stock market capitalisation, based on World Bank data.
SPACs do offer them a new route to raising cash.
""They represent one arrow in the quiver - alongside private capital, traditional IPOs and acquisitions,"" said Alexandre Lazarow, a venture capitalist with Cathay Innovation. 
But it will not be plain sailing.
The global SPAC boom at the start of this year showed signs of fading by May amid investor worries about valuations. Some U.S. businesses have halted plans to list.
""The explosion and subsequent quenching of SPAC enthusiasm in developed markets provides a potential lesson for emerging markets to learn from,"" said Alex Korda, analyst at consultancy The Edge Group.
Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer equity research at research firm Tellimer, said U.S.-listed SPACs may be appropriate for emerging market companies where a loss-making history or limited operating records make it hard for them to list via an IPO.
As for listing SPACs on emerging country stock exchanges, this looks much more uncertain.
Singapore's stock market in March said it was proposing introducing regulations to allow SPAC listings, while Dubai's bourse is consulting market participants on the issue. 
""Investors may shun this untested regulatory structure for the established SPAC market in the U.S.,"" Tiruchelvam wrote in a research note.

""Liquidity in EM will not match U.S. levels for EM-related SPACs. There is massive chasm between the liquidity of the U.S.-listed EM tech stocks and those listed on local exchanges.""

1627,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 10:54AM ET</span>",China Stocks in U.S. Erase $740 Billion as Crackdown Deepens,"(Bloomberg) -- Beijing’s sweeping crackdowns of its technology and education sectors has unleashed shockwaves across global markets, causing U.S.-listed Chinese stocks to post their biggest back-to-back losses in over a decade.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index plunged 5.6% Monday morning after regulators in China unveiled an overhaul of its education sector that bans firms that teach school subjects from making profits, raising capital or going public. The gauge -- which tracks 98 of China’s biggest firms listed in the U.S. -- is on pace for its biggest two-day drop since 2008 and has lost more than $740 billion in value since reaching a record high in February.
“The regulatory uncertainty is significant and is something that is impossible for investors to quantify,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “Investors should be cautious until the Chinese government affirms the legality of these structures,” he added.

Some of large investors have already started to unload their shares. Cathie Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF cut its holdings of China stocks to less than 0.5% this month from a high of 8% in February. The fund completely exited its position in tech-giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). and has just 134 shares of Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. Its only other position, Chinese property site KE Holdings Inc., has dropped 58% so far this year.
TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL), New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. and Gaotu Techedu Inc., some of China’s largest education companies, are all down at least 25% each Monday, adding to their record declines from Friday.
The trio has seen their shares stuck in an extended plunge for much of the past five months, bringing their loss for the year to nearly 93%.
They’re not alone either. In total, more than $100 billion in market capitalization has been erased from Chinese education stocks traded in the U.S., China and Hong Kong this year.
“Given the magnitude of the uncertainties, it is challenging for us to quantify the overall risks at this point, but it is clear that we are entering an uncharted territory with substantial moving parts,” according to Benchmark analyst Fawne Jiang.
While the pain has been felt the most by education stocks, other sectors may soon be under the gun as well.
Property management stocks traded in Hong Kong tumbled on Monday after regulators said they were aiming to “notably improve order” in the market. Meanwhile, food-delivery giant Meituan saw its shares plunge by a record 14% as authorities in Beijing issued a notice that online food platforms must, among other things, respect the rights of delivery staff and ensure workers earn at least the local minimum income.

The luxury electric-vehicle maker, run by an ex-Tesla engineer, had agreed to go public in February through a merger with Churchill Capital Corp IV. The merger gave the combined company a pro-forma equity value of $24 billion.
Lucid's listing is a huge dividend for the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, which had invested over $1 billion in the electric-car maker in 2018 to take a substantial stake. PIF, in a tweet, congratulated Lucid after it went public today.
Shares of Lucid, which opened at $25.24, were up 6.5% in early trading. 
With emission regulations being made tougher in Europe and elsewhere, the Biden administration's green wave push in the U.S. as well as the rise of electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc have investors rushing into the EV sector.

Other prominent players in the sector went public through mergers with so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) last year. While some deals such as Fisker have delivered, others such as Nikola have given up short-term gains.
Although SPACs had gained immense popularity among retail traders as well as Wall Street funds last year, a fear of a bubble and frothy valuations triggered a sell-off in shares of SPACs in March.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 10:38AM ET</span>",Analysis-U.S. manufacturers take a double hit from labor and materials,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Calder Brothers Corp is under pressure to raise wages after rivals lured away some of its workers. A few others were also considering jumping ship, but co-owner Glen Calder said the South Carolina-based construction machinery company managed to persuade them to stay by promising a better career.
With willing workers in short supply across the United States and companies frantically vying for them, Calder knows his firm cannot hold off pay increases. At the same time, however, soaring prices for the raw materials used in the asphalt paving machines his company builds have left it with no wiggle room.
""It's really squeezed the company from an operational standpoint,"" Calder said.
American manufacturers of all sizes are grappling with the strongest inflationary pressure in three decades following a relentless rise in raw-materials prices in the past 13 months.
Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) said last week it would impose an average pricing surcharge of 2% from July 1 on select models sold in the United States to mitigate the cost pressure, which shaved off 5 percentage points from its profit in the latest quarter. Yet the motorcycle maker expects earnings to suffer in the second half of the year.
Higher commodity prices are eating into corporate budgets, making it tougher for manufacturers to compete in a tight labor market.
Calder Brothers, for example, is paying 50% more for some of its components. Overall, its material costs are up 15% this year. Sales of its machines have recovered but are still below pre-pandemic levels.
The company is now waiting for a 10% price increase to come into effect in the fall to provide some financial leeway to hand out pay raises of 2% to 4%. In the interim, it has bumped up its contribution to its retirement plan for employees.
Calder said his company is one of the best paymasters in Greenville County, where it is located. With the starting pay at $16.80 an hour, its wages are far above state or federal minimums. Yet it has lost 10% of its workforce since last fall.
JOSTLING FOR WORKERS 
The equipment maker faces the challenge of retaining workers at a time when it needs more hands to keep up with customer orders. It has been running job ads for four welders, two machinists and five assemblers since February, but has managed to fill just three positions thus far.
The tight labor market has also discouraged Calder Brothers from mandating vaccines for its employees. With just 35% of workers vaccinated on the shop floor and the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus spreading quickly, its operations are at risk.
""In today's labor market, I really don't want to do anything to make anybody mad,"" said Calder.
American manufacturers have long complained about labor shortages. But until this April, wage gains for production workers failed to keep pace with the overall trend in the economy.
This year, the U.S. labor supply has been further limited by a combination of enhanced jobless benefits, lingering concern about returning to work, childcare issues and pandemic-related retirements as well as career changes.
The number of job openings at manufacturers is at the highest level in two decades, according to data from the U.S. Labor Department. Adding to the challenge, more workers are quitting their jobs than at any time in at least two decades.
Meanwhile, a booming economy has sparked a competitive frenzy as manufacturers are now jostling for workers with companies like McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which are offering higher wages as well as signing bonuses.
As a result, employee wages are projected to rise over the next 12 months at the fastest pace in two decades, according to a survey by the National Association of Manufacturers.
""You either take people off the couch or you take them from other businesses,"" said Calder. ""It's not easy.""
SUPPLY LOGJAM WORSENS 
Other manufacturers are facing a similar predicament. Georgia-based Win-Tech Inc, which makes parts for  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), last month lost out on a hire after it failed to match the counteroffer from the applicant's employer.
Allison Krache Giddens, Win-Tech's president, said the applicant's employer doubled the salary in response to her company's offer. With supply-chain logjam inflating her costs, Giddens said there is a limit to what her company can pay to attract workers as it needs to stay cost-competitive.
If the price pressure does not abate, she worries it will crimp her ability to hire workers and expand the business.
""What we will end up doing is not taking on as much work,"" she said. ""We're going to take on work so that we can remain profitable and be a successful business.""
The struggle to find workers is not imposing constraints only on manufacturers' ability to ramp up. It is also contributing to supply and logistics bottlenecks.
Win-Tech has a set of jobs that go out twice a month to California and then return to Georgia for final manufacturing. The whole trip now takes up to two weeks compared with five days earlier as the company's trucking company cannot find drivers.

Similarly, Calder Brothers is not able to obtain wiring harnesses on time as its supplier is short of workers. To get around the problem, Calder said the supplier has moved the production from South Carolina to Tunisia.
""I don't have manpower; our suppliers don't have manpower; the transportation markets don't have manpower,"" he said. ""It's just a challenge.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Phillips Chemical Company failed to disclose to regulators significant amounts of at least 18 toxic chemicals imported to the United States over the past several years, as required by law, according to letters seen by Reuters.
Reuters previously reported that Chevron Phillips Chemical failed to disclose more than 350 million pounds of benzene, a chemical used in commercial and household products that is known to cause cancer, following an analysis by the Center for Environmental Health, a non-profit watchdog group.
""Their problems with reporting and the scope of noncompliance are obviously expanding,"" said Robert Sussman, CEH's legal counsel and a former senior official with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ""Obviously there is a systemic problem.""
The EPA requires companies to report large quantities of manufactured and imported chemicals, which helps the agency gauge the risk of exposure to workers at chemical plants and the communities that surround them, as well as consumers and others that could come into contact with the toxins. 
In a response to CEH's letter of intent to sue over the lacking disclosures, an attorney for Chevron Phillips Chemical said an initial investigation by the company found that it had not reported imports of the additional chemicals. The letter from Woodlands, Texas-based Chevron Phillips Chemical's legal counsel, dated July 9, said the company has launched an outside audit of its disclosure compliance. 
A Chevron Phillips Chemical spokesperson told Reuters the company has since fixed the data. 
""We have corrected the reports with EPA and are reviewing procedures to ensure accurate reporting in the future,"" the company said in an email. It declined further comment, saying it generally doesn't remark on ""matters under consideration by a regulatory agency.""
The EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It's not clear what the 18 chemicals were or how much were imported, but failing to report is a violation of the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act, and can result in fines of tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Companies are required to report quantities of toxic chemicals imported to the United States of 25,000 pounds per facility in a single year. The threshold is lowered to 2,500 pounds for a select number of chemicals considered particularly dangerous.

CEH filed lawsuits against three other companies last month on claims of underreporting, or failing to report, large quantities of benzene and other potentially harmful chemicals into the United States. 
The EPA has fined companies in the past for similar violations, according to agency documents.

The airline's board says the bonus proposal is needed to help retain Jozsef Varadi, whom it says is ""the leading global airline CEO"" and wants to sign a new five-year contract.
Several shareholder advisory groups have urged investors to vote against the proposals on future bonuses. 
Glass Lewis said the company's ""new value creation plan"" (VCP) for the CEO and other senior leaders had the potential for ""excessive payouts"". 
The maximum payout was considered excessive, said Institutional Shareholder Services, adding that ""no compelling explanation has been provided to justify the quantum"". 
Under the VCP, Varadi will be set a target to double the company's share price over the next five year period. There are also environmental, social and governance objectives attached to the payout. Over the last five years, Wizz's share price has risen by over 200%. 
Varadi, 55, co-founded Wizz in 2003. The airline has since grown rapidly, spreading from its core eastern European markets of Poland, Hungary and Romania into Britain, Italy and other parts of western Europe.
Wizz has continued to take delivery of planes during the pandemic and add new routes while some rivals have contracted, but like many airlines COVID-19 has caused it problems. 
Michael O'Leary, boss of rival Ryanair, has also faced battles over pay. His five-year bonus plan, worth up to 100 million euros if targets related to share price and profitability are hit, scraped through with 50.5% support in a shareholder vote in 2019.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets retreated from all-time highs at the open on Monday, weighed on by fresh worries for the future of Chinese ADRs and by concern at the growing spread of Covid-19 in the U.S., and its possible impact on the economy. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 20 points, or less than 0.1%, at 35,041 points. The Nasdaq Composite was down in line while S&P 500 was up by less than 0.1%.
Earlier, newswires reported that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) had cut its U.S. growth forecasts for the third and fourth quarters by 1 percentage point each, in part due to the renewed spread of Covid-19 weighing on the service sector. Separately, a survey by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) showed that over half of its clients expect some form of Covid-related restrictions to be back in place before the end of the year. 
The day's only major data release also surprised to the downside: new home sales fell for a third straight month in June, by 6.6%, to their lowest in 14 months.
The prospect of a slowing economy once again drew attention to the stretched valuations of U.S. markets after 16 months of extraordinary stimulus. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), noted via Twitter that the forward price/sales ratio of the S&P is now higher than at the peak of the 2000 Internet bubble. 
The morning's biggest movers were, once again, largely Chinese ADRs, which tumbled after a multi-pronged attack on the country's tech sector over the weekend. The government confirmed leaks on Friday that it intends to force online education providers to turn into non-profits, while two separate regulators banned Tencent Music from holding certain exclusive music rights and issued a sharply-worded reminder to food delivery companies of the need to pay at least the minimum wage. 
After earlier dealings, EdTech names New Oriental Education & Technology (NYSE:EDU) was down 24% while TAL Education (NYSE:TAL) was down 17% and Ke Holdings (NYSE:BEKE) was down 18%. Tencent Music  (NYSE:TME) stock meanwhile fell 5.1% and Meituan (OTC:MPNGY), the country's biggest food delivery service, fell 12% to a new all-time low.  Meituan is also backed by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), which fell 7.8% to a 10-month low.
In the U.S., meanwhile, Aon (NYSE:AON) stock rose 6.5% and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) stock fell 5.9% after the two insurers called off their planned merger due to resistance from antitrust regulators at the Department of Justice, who feared the deal would limit choice and lead to higher prices. 
Among the biggest gainers was  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN)l stock, which rose 8.0% after rumors of interest from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in cryptocurrency pushed the price of Bitcoin up by over 15% through the weekend. Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) stock rose 9.0% to its highest since the start of the pandemic after reporting strong quarterly numbers. However, the big earnings release of the day is from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which reports its numbers after the close. Tesla stock rose 1.0% in anticipation of a record quarterly profit. The company sold 206,000 cars in the second quarter, escaping the worst of the global chip shortage.

Though the Fed forecasts two interest rate hikes in 2023, the current deceleration in economic growth due to concerns over the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant might push that timeline back further.
Furthermore, recent concerns regarding a potential market correction coupled with a rising crackdown by China on ADRs of Chinese companies are expected to reduce the number of IPOs and SPAC deals in the near term.

Investing.com – Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) stock rose 3% in Monday’s premarket trading after the company posted a 54% jump in second-quarter revenue to $1.32 billion.
Hasbro Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner said the company remains on track for double-digit revenue growth for the full year.  
The company repaid $250 million in debt and reported the lowest days sales outstanding in its recent history.
Demand for Hasbro’s toys was strong. Wizards of the Coast and gaming segment revenue more than doubled in the second quarter and surpassed 2019 numbers. This was led by Dungeons & Dragons, Duel Masters, as well as the launch of Foosketball.  
Revenue from the entertainment and consumer products segments grew 47% and 33%, respectively.
Entertainment segment revenue increased with growth in TV and film, Family Brands and Music, backed by an increase in content.
Revenue from both scripted and unscripted programs grew. Family Brands benefited from content deals for several properties including My Little Pony, Peppa Pig and PJ Masks, as well as growth in YouTube advertising revenues.
In consumer products segment, revenue grew in all regions and licensing.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share came at $1.05 versus 2 cents in the same quarter last year.

The deal would have put London-headquartered Aon ahead of the world's largest insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc.
""Despite regulatory momentum around the world, including the recent approval of our combination by the European Commission, we reached an impasse with the U.S. Department of Justice,"" Aon Chief Executive Officer Greg Case said in a statement.
Aon will pay $1 billion as termination fee to Willis, it said.
In June, the Department of Justice (DOJ) had sued to block the deal, saying it would reduce competition and could lead to higher prices.
The DOJ had alleged that combining the two large insurance brokers would harm competition in reinsurance broking, retirement and pension planning and private retiree multicarrier healthcare exchanges. 
A federal judge had narrowed the scope of the lawsuit last week, which came after Aon and Willis agreed to divestitures to win approval in the United States and Europe after discussions with regulators.
The divestitures included Aon's U.S. retirement unit, U.S. retiree healthcare exchange and retirement business in Germany. Also included was Willis Towers Watson's global reinsurance business. EU antitrust regulators approved the merger earlier this month conditioned on some of the sales.
Aon ranks second and Willis fifth among U.S. commercial insurance brokers in the U.S. market, according to a survey by Business Insurance magazine. 
The other largest brokers in the United States are Marsh & McLennan, Arthur J Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) and Alliant Insurance Services Inc.

In April, insurance company Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd said it was no longer looking at buying smaller rival, the Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG) Inc, after the latter rebuffed Chubb's takeover bids post declining to engage in talks on the $23.24 billion buyout proposal. 
Aon's shares were up 4% at $242, while Willis Tower's stock was down 3.5% at $218 in pre-market trading.

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 08:47AM ET</span>",Analysis-Regulators turn spotlight on company sustainability ratings,"By Huw Jones and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Organisations that rate companies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are now themselves facing scrutiny, as regulators look to improve consistency and transparency in an industry that influences trillions of dollars of investments.
The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which groups market regulators from the United States, Europe and Asia, recommended in a consultation paper on Monday that its members consider formally regulating an industry that has so far largely been left to its own devices.
This lack of regulation has prompted concerns among some investors, who say methods of calculating ESG ratings are opaque, and environmentalists, who fear ""greenwashing"" - or that companies might sometimes get an ESG rating they don't deserve. 
The ESG ratings industry draws its roots from anti-apartheid activists in the late 1980s and early 1990s who wanted investments that had no links to South Africa.
But growth has taken off in recent years as climate change and issues such as diversity have become a bigger focus for investors, fuelling consolidation in a sector led by global players including MSCI and Morningstar's Sustainalytics.
Further embedding the ESG ratings process at the heart of the financial system, countries and regions including the European Union are pushing companies to disclose more data and for investment firms to do more to explain how they use it.
""It's becoming an absolutely core element of everything that we are doing, therefore the fact that it is regulated, for us, totally makes sense,"" said Jean-Jacques Barberis, executive board member of asset manager Amundi.
Sustainable assets made up $35.3 trillion, or more than a third of all professionally managed assets in five of the world's biggest markets, a recent report from the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance showed.
MSCI and Sustainalytics had no immediate comment on IOSCO's proposals.
COMPLEXITY
Some draw parallels to credit rating agencies (CRAs), left largely unregulated until the global financial crisis just over a decade ago. But asset managers and raters themselves caution about using the same regulatory template for ESG raters, an area they say is harder to get precise answers.
Unlike CRAs, which get paid by the companies they are rating, ESG raters are paid by the fund managers who use their analysis, meaning there is less conflict of interest. The information ESG raters base their ratings on is also publicly available, unlike credit ratings.
And while credit ratings look at the relatively narrow issue of corporate default risk, ESG ratings assess a much wider array of subjects, from board diversity to carbon emissions and a company's policy on bribery.
Some users of ESG ratings, like asset managers, say the sector is not clear enough about how that works, making it impossible to replicate how a particular rating is arrived at.
Ratings on the same company can differ widely between raters, unlike the close correlation in ratings from CRAs.
A study from the OECD in late 2020 cited a number of reasons for the low correlation between ESG ratings providers, including the use of different frameworks, key indicators and metrics, relative weightings as well as qualitative judgement.
This leaves many asset managers having to subscribe to a range of ESG raters, and those with deep pockets often go a step further by doing extra work on bought-in ratings to reassure themselves.
""We don't rely on ESG ratings from the major providers as a blind tool,"" said Andy Howard, global head of sustainable investment at asset manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR).
""This is probably one of the most important but least well developed areas in terms of analysis within finance,"" Howard said, adding regulators should focus on improving transparency and objectivity in how the ratings are constructed.
""One of the challenges here, is a tendency to use ESG ratings without really thinking about precisely what it is you're trying to measure and whether that particular rating system is an appropriate way of measuring that thing, or not.""
CROSSROADS 
Amundi's Barberis said he wanted to see more correlation on climate-related aspects given they can be measured more precisely than social factors.
""If I had one priority where I think we need a full absolute harmonisation of indicators, criteria, and therefore, the associated subcomponents of the rating, it's on climate.""
Faced with patchy disclosures, world leaders have backed creating a new International Sustainability Standards Board later this year which is expected to publish its first batch of corporate climate disclosures next year.
IOSCO said the ESG ratings sector was ""fluid"" in terms of where it was heading, making regulating it trickier.

""If corporates provide more information on that front, certainly there is a possibility that the role of ESG ratings and data products providers could decrease,"" said IOSCO member Satoshi Ikeda of Japan's Financial Services Agency.
""While we are very much at the crossroads ... we are in a sense cautious about being definitive in designing the course of action regulators should take. We set out those recommendations in ways that accommodate the possible pathways that could evolve in a few years' time,"" Ikeda told reporters.

""The goal is to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2022, with... over 2 billion euros in direct consolidated revenues,"" Chairman and CEO Giorgio Armani said on Sunday in a statement announcing 2020 results and the trend for January-June.
The luxury group said consolidated net sales had fallen 25% last year to 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion), with most of the decline occurring in the first half of 2020.
Luxury goods sales around the world fell sharply last year for the first time in years as the pandemic forced shop closures and brought international tourism to a virtual halt.
""The drop in revenues in 2020 should be read not only as a consequence of the pandemic... but also in line with Giorgio Armani's own strategic principle of 'less is more',"" said Armani Deputy Managing Director Giuseppe Marsocci.
The Milan-based group did not give the value of total sales in January-June but said the positive sales trend so far this year pointed to a much better profitability scenario for 2021. 
For the whole of last year the group made a consolidated net profit of 90 million euros but an operating loss (EBIT) of 29 million euros. 
It also said on Sunday that its financial position improved significantly in the first half with net cash and cash equivalents of 1.088 billion euros ""ensuring the financial resources necessary for the Group's medium to long-term stability and growth"".
Speculation about succession plans at Armani has come to the fore recently, especially after the 87-year-old designer said he could consider teaming up with another Italian company. 

Sources told Reuters earlier this month that John Elkann, scion of Italy's Agnelli family, had explored a possible tie-up as part of plans to build a luxury conglomerate.

Investing.com – Ryanair (LON:RYA) was trading 4.4% higher in London trading Monday following comments from chief executive Michael O’Leary that pointed to strong revival in air traffic and the airline possibly achieving a breakeven this financial year.
O'Leary said the airline is seeing a strong rebound of pent-up travel demand into August and September and “we expect this to continue into the second half of FY22.” 
He added that reaching a full-year breakeven would be dependent on the continued rollout of vaccines this summer, ""and no adverse Covid variant developments,” Leary said in a press release.
Europe’s largest no-frills airline had posted a net loss of 815 million euro ($962 million) in the financial year ended March 31.   
In the three months through June, the airline posted a wider loss of 273 million euros, compared to 185 million a year earlier. Revenue almost trebled to 371 million euro from 125 million euro.
O'Leary said traffic in the current fiscal year is likely to improve to between 90 million and 100 million. That implies a slight improvement in the outlook, given that it had previously guided to the lower end of a range between 80 million and 120 million.
He said visibility for the rest of the year is “close to zero” as people are booking very close to travel dates and fares are staying well below pre COVID-19 levels.
European airlines, like in the rest of the world, have had a tumultuous time for more than a year as governments clamped down on air travel to curb the spread of the pandemic.
That triggered the collapse of many European airlines including Flybe, Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NORR) and Lufthansa's Germanwings, and led to substantial capacity cuts at others including Alitalia and SAS (ST:SAS).
The company said it expects to benefit from a strong travel rebound, new bases in Europe and capacity reductions by its competitors.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 07:39AM ET</span>","Analysis-Tesla's plans for batteries, China scrutinized as Musk drops features","By Hyunjoo Jin
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has weathered the pandemic and supply chain crisis better than many of its rivals, achieving record deliveries last quarter. But Chief Executive Elon Musk faces pressure to deliver on breakthrough batteries and new factories and models, which are late.
Those questions, demand in China and the financial effect of a Bitcoin sell-off will be high on investors' minds when the electric vehicle company publishes results Monday.
Last September, Musk announced an ambitious plan to produce its own battery cells with a new design and manufacturing process.
The larger, simpler-to-make batteries, in theory would have higher energy density and would extend ranges of current vehicles and let Tesla offer a $25,000 car in three years, sharpening its technology edge as rivals flood the market with EVs. 
But Musk last month pushed back the debut of 4680s by cancelling the longest-range Model S Plaid+, which he had said would use the cells, sparking concern. He has said 4680s would go into volume production next year and would be used in the Model Y from the Texas factory under construction. 
Now, Tesla aims to produce vehicles with 4680 batteries starting with small volume this year in as-yet-unfinalized models, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
One of the persons said Tesla will initially use batteries made at Tesla's pilot production line in California, adding that they are being tested in prototype vehicles. 
Tesla is also closely working with Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) to develop 4680 cells, he said. LG, another Tesla supplier, is working to produce 4680 battery cells for Tesla by 2023, Reuters reported earlier.
But it is not clear when Tesla will be able to mass-produce the new batteries in Texas and Berlin, and it will be able to achieve all of the ambitious goals for batteries, industry officials said. 
""It has required an *immense* amount of engineering to take Maxwell’s proof-of-concept to high-quality, volume production & we’re still not quite done,"" Musk said, referring to its dry battery electrode manufacturing process it is developing after acquiring Maxwell. 
Tesla was not available for comments.
MODEL S PLAID 
While rivals with larger production have regularly paused production over supply problems, Tesla has largely kept factories moving. It also cut some features and raised car prices, including a $4,000 hike of the long-range Model Y to $53,990 from April to late July. The move came as Tesla is bracing for a hit from its bitcoin investments and falling sales of environmental credits to other carmakers, income sources that the company relies on to post quarterly profits.
Tesla accelerated plans to drop a radar sensor from its driver assistance system because of a chip shortage, a person familiar with the matter said, and dropped adjustable lumbar support from its passenger seat. ""Not worth cost/mass for everyone when almost never used,"" Musk tweeted. 
""Tesla adapts very quickly to what they need,"" said investor Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management. 
""I just don't see any huge catalyst, like, oh, they're gonna blow out their numbers this quarter,"" Gerber said. ""We are much more bullish for Q3 than Q2,"" said Gerber, expecting Tesla to ramp up production of the higher-margin Model S Plaid.
Shortly after the June launch, one of the high-end models burst into flames while the owner was driving. 
CHINA 
A roller coaster ride in China raised questions of political and competitive challenges in Tesla's second-largest market.
Tesla sales in China slumped in April amid negative publicity from consumer complaints, quality issues and regulatory pressure. Its sales rebounded in May and June, as Tesla launches quarter-end promotion campaign like loan offers, according to advertisements at showrooms. 

The automaker also this month introduced a cheaper version of the Model Y in China. 
""China is the linchpin to the bull thesis,"" Tesla bull and Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said. ""You need to see a ramp in the second half of the year,"" he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Monday, falling back from record highs ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting and a week of earnings from the major tech companies.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 135 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 25 points, or 0.2%.
All three of the major equity indices closed Friday at record levels but are expected to retreat Monday, weighed by sharp losses in Asia after the Chinese government continued its regulatory clampdown on large swathes of its economy. It released plans to reform the country’s education technology sector over the weekend and also fired a warning shot across the bows of the food delivery sector on Monday. 
This crackdown on the Chinese tech companies continues to put pressure on their American Depositary Receipts, and thus Wall Street as a whole, although there are signs that investors have switched back to U.S. tech plays out of their Chinese counterparts.
This week is scheduled to be one of the busiest for earnings reports, with the high-profile tech sector in the spotlight, particularly after the recent shift away from the reflation trade back into growth stocks.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is due to release numbers after the close Monday, and then Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Tuesday, before Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) later in the week.
Amazon will also be in focus Monday amid speculation that the online retail giant is exploring venturing into digital currencies after it advertised last week a vacancy for a digital currency product lead.
Aside from earnings, the Federal Reserve holds a two-day policy meeting this week, concluding on Wednesday. The central bank’s policymakers began debating last month when to start cutting back its massive bond-buying program, and investors will be looking for more information on the subject, particularly given the above-trend economic growth and inflation.
The only data release of note on Monday is new home sales at 10 AM ET, which are expected to have rebounded from an 11-month low in June. However, there are a number of important releases throughout the week, with the first look at second quarter U.S. GDP growth on Thursday the highlight. Newswires reported earlier that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has slashed its forecasts for growth in the second half, due in part to the revived spread of Covid-19 in the U.S.  New case numbers hit their highest in three months over the weekend.
Elsewhere, oil prices weakened Monday after eking out a small gain over the course of last week, amid reports of China cutting official selling prices for diesel and gasoline.
At 7:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $71.66 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $73.08.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 06:11AM ET</span>","Everybody take the week off, Wall Street firm tells staff","By David French and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - No calls, no emails and no meetings.
That's the order this week from Aquiline Capital Partners to its staff. The private equity firm is putting all employees on vacation, people familiar with the matter said. 
It's an unusual move intended to recognize employees and avoid burnout from the physical and mental pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic and the frenetic pace of dealmaking. 
Aquiline has more than $6 billion in assets and over 60 employees in its New York headquarters and London office. 
The firm has canceled all internal meetings for the week and told employees to refrain from calls, emails and chatroom messages, the sources said. If a company owned by Aquiline has an emergency, an employee will step in, one added.
Aquiline, founded in 2005 by Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Greenberg, also plans to give all staff a second week off at the end of August, the sources added.
The move is a rare step in the high-stakes financial services industry which is confronting the mental health impact of intense work and pandemic stress.
Aquiline's business of buying, operating and selling companies is typically not as frenzied as other corners of Wall Street, such as trading desks. But its decision stands out among private equity firms known for demanding long hours and hard work from their employees in exchange for rich paychecks.
Everyone switching off at the same time means people will be able to relax fully, knowing that developments at the office will not interrupt their vacation, the first source added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the policy has not been communicated externally. Aquiline, which invests in financial services companies, declined to comment.
The pandemic has prompted heightened awareness of Wall Street's work-centered culture and its effects on physical and mental health. Workers have been speaking out, and employers have been experimenting with ways to reward staff as well as address stress and its effects.
""It's definitely unusual,"" Doug Haynes, president of Council Advisors, a consulting firm that works with top executives, said of Aquiline's move.
He noted that remote work has made it harder for employers to spot when staff are showing signs of exhaustion, so more firms are thinking about policies to improve mental health.

These pandemic-related pressures come as dealmaking is booming for firms like Aquiline. Private equity-backed mergers and acquisitions reached an all-time high in the first half of 2021, according to data provider Refinitiv.
Among Aquiline's deals so far in 2021 was an agreement to buy Aon (NYSE:AON)'s U.S. retirement business.

Investing.com – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock was trading higher in Monday’s premarket amid speculation that the Cloud and retail giant is exploring venturing into digital currencies.
It emerged last week that the U.S.’s biggest e-commerce company had advertised a vacancy for a digital currency product lead. It hasn't given any other indication of its intentions toward crypto, however.
Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, crossed $39,000 for the first time since June 16, and touched 39,639.9, the day’s highest so far. At 5.20 am ET, it traded at 38,282, almost 11% higher.  
The crypto is still about 40% off the April 14 high of 64,778.
Other cryptos surged too. Ethereum ETH/USD was up 8%, Cardano Cardano 10% and Dogecoin DOGE/USD 14%.  
Crypto prices have been struggling since a Chinese crackdown on their trading two months ago. China dealt another major blow last month when it shut down cryptocurrency mining projects in Sichuan province. 
Sichuan was China's second-biggest bitcoin mining province and the country accounted for more than half of global bitcoin production.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s comments last week also boosted sentiment for the cryptos. He said the company could again start accepting bitcoin as payment if crypto mining becomes less reliant on fossil fuels. That appears unlikely in the near term, as mining operations have migrated to countries like Kazakhstan, which is just as heavily reliant on coal for its electricity.

The guidelines were issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation along with six other administrative departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission, the Cyberspace Administration of China and the Ministry of Public Security.
Food delivery platforms in China, including Meituan and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Ele.me, have drawn severe criticism on social media for their treatment of delivery riders, most of whom are not covered by basic social and medical insurance.
Both, Meituan and Alibaba's Ele.me did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. 
Meituan has been working with the government to purchase employment injury insurance for its delivery drivers, the company's chief executive, Wang Xing, said on a conference call in May.

Investors are worrying about the rising cost of employing riders by the platforms, Reuters had previously reported. 
Meituan's Hong Kong-listed shares slumped nearly 14%, against a 4.13% drop in the Hang Seng Index.

Prosus plunged as much as 9.3% Monday, the most intraday since November last year. The Chinese government has announced curbs including banning companies that teach school curricula from making profit, raising capital or going public. Prosus has invested heavily in the global ed-tech sector, spending more than $2 billion on online learning and employee training platforms last month in Europe.
Prosus holds parent Naspers Ltd.’s 29% stake in Tencent. The Cape Town-based company made an initial investment in the Chinese game-maker in 2001 and in 2019 spun-off most of its internet assets into Prosus and listed it on the Euronext exchange. Prosus and Naspers have accelerated their investments into the ed-tech space, with the biggest moves in the U.S., India and Europe, rather than in China. Naspers fell as much as 7.8% in Johannesburg, the most intraday since March 2020.
“The idea authorities would wipe out the listed private education sector, with the stroke of a pen, is very unnerving,” said Gary Booysen, a portfolio manager at Rand Swiss in Johannesburg. “Many investors, who were attracted by the cheap valuations and the exciting prospects of generating profits from a large, rapidly urbanizing population, are nursing hangovers this morning. I’m sure many are questioning Chinese stock markets as a viable investment destination.”
China has prohibited overseas investment in companies that teach school subjects, according to a notice released by the State Council. That will make it difficult for Prosus to expand any of its ed-tech ambitions in the Asian country. Spokespeople for Naspers and Prosus said they were preparing a comment on the latest developments.
In a further sign of China’s widening crackdown on the tech space, American Depositary Receipts for online music platform  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME) plunged 19% in U.S. premarket trading after Chinese regulators ordered the company to give up exclusive streaming rights and pay a fine.
“Both Naspers and Prosus have been weak year-to-date, and as long as the regulatory risk remains front of mind, the stocks could remain under selling pressure,” said Lester Davids, a strategist at Unum Capital.

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 05:11AM ET</span>",Analysis - Law without order: investors grapple with China's regulatory risk,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - Western investors are wrestling with the risks of investing in U.S. listed stocks of Chinese companies after Beijing embarked on a regulatory crackdown on large swathes of its economy, from the internet sector to private tutoring.
The S&P/BNY Mellon China Select ADR Index, which tracks the American depositary receipts (ADRs) of major U.S.-listed Chinese companies, dropped 5.9% on Friday after Beijing moved to bar tutoring for profit in core school subjects, triggering a collapse in the shares in the sector.
It was the latest in a series of actions by Beijing that have caused the index to lose 18.8% since the beginning of the year. A string of cybersecurity investigations by Chinese regulators into major technology companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) has prompted many investors to dump their shares. 
China's latest crackdown on technology firms was announced just two days after ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc went public in New York at the end of last month. Its shares are down 42% since the initial public offering.
The Chinese Communist Party's uneasy relationship with private business has always weighed on the minds of Western investors who seek legal and regulatory certainty to place their bets.
Yet Beijing's recent moves are unsettling even seasoned investors who are otherwise used to navigating corporate China's murky auditing and poor governance in order to chase growth in the world's second-largest economy.
Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, where he oversees more than $30 billion in assets, said he believed Beijing's end game was to bring capital back to China. He said he was bullish on many Chinese consumer-facing companies over the long term because of the country's emerging middle class, but that it was difficult to price stocks in the short term.
""The near-term picture is murky as Chinese ADR issuers are caught in the crossfire between U.S. regulators that are asking for more disclosures and Chinese regulators that demand privacy for data on Chinese citizens,"" Gokhman said.
Some investors deem these investments too risky. Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, said he has not held any China-related stocks in his portfolio for the last two years because of the political risk.
""What we have done is moved away from the fundamentals of the companies. It has now become a political football and there is no way to analyze that and put it into a financial spreadsheet,"" Nolte said.
The vexing question for many investors is whether they can call the bottom in these stocks. With the S&P 500 at record levels after rallying more than 95% from its March 2020 lows, they are trying to establish whether the next rally could come in Chinese ADRs.

The discrepancy in the trajectory of the shares of U.S. and Chinese companies has been especially profound in the technology sector. The regulatory clamp-down has suppressed the value of Chinese tech firms just as U.S. technology giants are riding high after work-from-home and big data trends accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""At this point, it is anyone's guess where (Chinese ADRs) will bottom, and where you are seeing this money go is to the U.S. big tech stocks,"" said Joel Kulina, a senior trader at Wedbush Securities who specializes in technology stocks.

1660,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 04:28AM ET</span>",Record Profits and Blockbuster Payouts: Here Come the Miners,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest mining companies are about to start revealing how much cash they’re churning out from this year’s commodity boom. Look out for record profits followed by eye-watering dividend payouts.
The top-five western diversified miners may have earned a combined $85 billion for the first half of the year, according to analyst estimates, more than double the level from a year ago. Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Group, the first to report on Wednesday, is expected to announce $22 billion of profit for the six months, on a par with its total for all of 2020.
The mining sector has been one of the biggest beneficiaries from the world’s efforts to emerge from the pandemic. The trillions of dollars poured into recovery packages have ignited demand for commodities like steel, iron ore and aluminum, driving prices sharply higher and sending inflation pressures rippling through the global economy.

And while previous rallies lured the industry into ambitious investment plans to build and expand mines, many producers this time appear content to return their profit windfalls to investors. The two biggest -- Rio and larger rival BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) -- have already been funneling record returns to shareholders.
Each of the group of five majors -- which also includes Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc and Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) -- are expected to report their biggest-ever earnings for the six months through June, according to average analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Rio could pay out 60% of its underlying earnings, according to some analyst estimates.
“This should be a pretty much stellar set of results all round,” said Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum Capital. “We’re expecting record dividends from BHP and Rio, while Anglo and Glencore also have the potential to surprise.”
Iron ore has been a big driver of profit for the largest producers. The world’s biggest commodity after oil hit a record in the first-half, and has spent the last three months hovering around $200 a ton, a level not seen in a decade. Steel and copper prices both set fresh records this year, thermal coal has also soared, and even diamonds have had a resurgence.
Some prices have retreated recently amid concerns about rising Covid-19 cases and as China moves to curb rising costs. Yet commodity prices across the board remain historically high for now.
U.S. copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc. gave a hint of what to expect when it reported last week. The company has wiped out $5 billion of debt in the last 12 months, hitting its target months ahead of schedule, and setting the stage for an increase in shareholder returns.
Anglo American Platinum Ltd. added to that on Monday. The company, 79% owned by Anglo American, paid out a record dividend of $3.1 billion that equates to 100% of first-half headline earnings.
For the iron ore miners such as Vale, BHP and Rio, it promises to be even better. Demand for the steelmaking ingredient, especially from China, is rampant and supply is constrained. China, which accounts for about half of global steel production, is making a record amount of the metal, while iron ore supply has never recovered from two dam disasters in Brazil.
Of course, the mining companies are not immune to inflation themselves -- iron ore operations in Australia are grappling with a sharp rise in labor costs due to worker shortages. And governments in resource-rich countries, especially in Latin America, are also looking at the industry as a source of extra revenue after the commodities rally.
For now though, the miners are cashing in.

The government posted a notice Monday asking meal delivery operators to respect the rights of delivery staff. Online food platforms must ensure that delivery workers earn at least the local minimum income, according to a guideline released by seven government agencies including the State Administration for Market Regulation.
Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.-backed Meituan, the industry’s largest operator alongside  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., is already grappling with an investigation into alleged monopolistic behavior.
The regulations, which echo previous warnings to the industry, comes days after China unveiled a broad set of reforms for private and online education companies, seeking to decrease workloads for students and overhaul a sector it says has been “hijacked by capital.” The sweeping crackdown on one of the country’s fastest-growing and best-funded sectors sent a chill through tech investors, who sold off Chinese internet stocks in Hong Kong Monday. Meituan’s stock has now tumbled almost 50% from its peak in February.

(Reuters) - Jeff Bezos-backed food-tech firm NotCo said on Monday it raised $235 million in its latest funding round that also included athletes Lewis Hamilton and Roger Federer, valuing the plant-based food company at $1.5 billion.
It makes plant-based milk, burger patties, meat and ice creams, and plans to use the new funding to expand in Asia and Europe and produce newer products for the North American market.
""Many companies have reached NotCo to say 'can you do a plant-based version of our products'. In that way, we can become the 'Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Inside' of other products,"" NotCo Chief Executive Officer Matias Muchnick told Reuters.
NotCo, which operates in six countries in the Americas, also plans to invest more on its artificial intelligence technology, Giuseppe, which explores new combinations of plants to replicate animal-based food products.
The funding, led by Tiger Global, also saw venture capital firm DFJ Growth Fund and social impact foundation ZOMA Lab pitch in.
Health and environment-conscious consumers have been adding plant-based foods to their diets, prompting several firms to launch their own versions following the success of industry leaders Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and Impossible Foods.
During the pandemic, demand for plant-based faux meat has surged as consumers seek safe and healthy alternatives.
""COVID raised the awareness of the plant-based food category. The growth of the category was massive,"" Muchnick said. 

Investment into plant-based foods reached about $1.7 billion in 2020, up nearly three times compared with 2019, according to research firm PitchBook. It projects the alt-proteins market to touch nearly $8 billion this year.
NotCo launched its plant-based milk NotMilk in the United States seven months ago and is on track to reach 8,000 retail outlets by the end of year, it said.

At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.7% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.6%.
European markets have had a negative handover from Asia Monday after the Chinese government continued its regulatory clampdown, releasing plans over the weekend to reform the $100 billion education sector, one of the country's most desired investment plays in recent years.  The spillover hit Asia-focused lenders HSBC (LON:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) both lost over 2% in London. Prosus (OTC:PROSF), the holding company that owns a 28% stake in Chinese tech giant Tencent (OTC:TCEHY), fell 8.8% in Amsterdam
Also weighing was the disappointing release of the German Ifo business climate index for July, falling to 100.8 from a revised 101.7 the previous month, with the rising Covid cases weighing on sentiment.
Aside from this, the earnings season remains in full swing in Europe, with Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock 3.4% higher after Europe’s largest low-cost carrier raised its forecast for full-year traffic on strong summer bookings. Ryanair reported a smaller first-quarter net loss than expected but said it expected to make a profit in the current quarter.
That comes against a backdrop of data that suggest the latest wave of Covid-19 cases was close to peaking in the U.K. before it lifted restrictions on social distancing last week. The seven-day average for case numbers has fallen over 20% in the last week.
Koninklijke Philips (NYSE:PHG) stock fell 1% despite beating second-quarter earnings expectations as the pandemic continued to spur demand for hospital equipment. However, the Dutch health technology company booked an additional provision of 250 million euros as it needs to replace millions of sleep devices it recalled earlier in June.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock fell 0.6% after the Swiss banking giant announced it had reached an out-of-court settlement with a former employee over allegations of spying that led to the resignation of the Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. 
Attention for much of this week is likely to turn further west, with the Federal Reserve, set to hold a two-day policy meeting, concluding on Wednesday, which could see the U.S. central bank announcing when it plans to start scaling back its hefty asset-purchasing program.

(Reuters) -Dutch health technology company Philips on Monday beat analysts' expectations with a jump in second-quarter core earnings to 532 million euros ($626 million), boosted by its personal health and diagnosis businesses. Analysts had expected adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) to rise to 519 million euros, up from 390 million euros a year earlier. 
The group also announced a 1.5 billion euro share buyback set to start in the third quarter and take up to three years. 
Comparable sales increased 9%, beating an average expectation of a 7.3% rise, though its sales were dragged by its sleep and respiratory care business.
The company booked an additional provision of 250 million euros as it works to repair and replace up to 4 million breathing devices and ventilators it recalled in June, bringing the total provision to 500 million euros.
Philips recalled the devices because of a foam part that might degrade and become toxic, potentially causing cancer.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week classified the recall of Philips' breathing devices and ventilators as the most serious type of recall, noting that over 1,200 complaints and 100 injuries had been reported.
In a call with reporters, Chief Executive Frans van Houten said the company was producing replacement and repair kits in anticipation of a green light from regulators, though once approved the deployment project could take up to 12 months due to the high number of devices in the field.
He added that the company was gathering evidence on the risks posed by the devices before the class action lawsuits that have been filed come to court.

Philips confirmed its 2021 sales growth forecast but narrowed down its profit margin expectations to the low end of its previous range.

LONDON (Reuters) - British asset manager M&G has launched a sustainable version of its flagship 56 billion pounds ($77 billion) PruFund range of funds, its chief executive told Reuters.
The move by M&G, carved out from insurer Prudential (NYSE:PUK) in 2019 and managing around 370 billion pounds in assets, is part of a shift to focus on investments that don't harm the environment amid surging demand from investors.
Assets in funds with a sustainability focus reached almost $2 trillion in the first quarter, data from industry tracker Morningstar showed.
Companies are rushing to adopt sustainability strategies, partly in response to investor pressure, but activists say their claims need to be scrutinised to ensure they are genuine.
M&G said the new multi-asset fund range, called PruFund Planet, was launched with 500 million pounds of investment from the company's 143 billion pound Prudential With-Profits Fund.
The existing PruFund range of funds, a favourite of retirees across Britain, currently manages around 56 billion pounds on behalf of 455,000 customers and invests in markets from stocks to bonds and real estate.
Each PruFund uses a smoothing mechanism to avoid extreme short-term stock market volatility. This means the funds do not experience the full highs - or extreme lows - of the markets.
Many with-profits funds have closed in recent years as the sector has faced regulatory reform and investors became more enthusiastic about riding a wave in equity markets.
Assets in UK with-profit funds dropped below 300 billion pounds in 2017 from around 400 billion in 2005, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.
PruFund and PruFund Planet are the only parts of the Prudential With-Profits Fund still open to new clients, although the former saw a steep fall in net inflows to 400 million pounds in 2020 from 6.4 billion in 2019, as the pandemic cut face-to-face meetings with financial advisers.
M&G said PruFund Planet was the first time a with-profits fund had given customers the chance to invest in a sustainability-focused way.
CEO John Foley said the existing PruFund range was transitioning to a sustainable strategy but was still invested in sectors such as coal.
""Clients and customers genuinely want us to pivot towards sustainability,"" he said. ""PruFund is moving in that direction but will take some years to get to a fully sustainable perspective.""
Foley said research among financial advisers showed half their clients wanted a sustainable alternative to conventional pension and savings products.

The Irish airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, said it expected to fly between 90 and 100 million passengers in its financial year to end-March 2022, up from an earlier forecast of 80-100 million. 
Ryanair flew 27.5 million passengers in the year to March 2021, down from a pre-COVID-19 peak of 149 million the previous year.
The loss of 273 million euros in the first quarter was slightly better than the 283 million euro loss forecast by a company poll of analysts.
Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement that it remained impossible to provide a meaningful profit forecast for the financial year to end-March 2022, but reiterated that the airline was cautiously expecting to post a small loss or break even. 
The airline expects to fly 9 million passengers in July, at the top of a previous forecast range of 7-9 million, rising to 10 million in August, O'Leary said. 
The airline, which faces a web of overlapping COVID-19 travel restrictions across Europe that has hamstrung the industry, said it expects a ""strong recovery"" in the winter and next summer as rivals cut back on capacity. 

Ryanair, which has one of the strongest balance sheets in the airline industry, said it had cash reserves of 4.06 billion euros, up from 3.15 billion at the end of March following a 1.2 billion euro bond sale in May.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese shares slumped on Monday as investor worries over the impact of government regulations kneecapped the education and property sectors, after Beijing barred for-profit tutoring in core school subjects.
The searing sell-off sent Hong Kong-listed Scholar Education Group shares crashing more than 43% in morning trade. Hong Kong stocks of New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc lost over a third of their value after U.S. shares plummeted more 50% on Friday. The company provides tutoring and test preparation services in China.
Sub-indexes tracking education and related sectors declined sharply. The CSI Education Index was last down 9.73% and the Hang Seng Tech index slumped 5.89%, touching its lowest level since Aug. 12, 2020.
The shakeout in China's $120 billion private tutoring sector follows Beijing's announcement on Friday of new rules barring for-profit tutoring in core school subjects to ease financial pressures on families. The policy change also restricts foreign investment in the sector through mergers and acquisitions, franchises, or variable interest entity (VIEs) arrangements.
Louis Tse, managing director at Wealthy Securities in Hong Kong, said the curbs were needed to prevent ""chaos"" in a profitable sector.
""The Chinese government...in a way it's right, they want to put a heavy hand and try to regulate that industry to make it more acceptable,"" he said. ""Of course investors....I won't say they suffer. They won't earn that much anymore.""
The crackdown on tutoring firms follows a tightening grip on China's internet sector that has rattled global investors. Beijing launched a data-related cybersecurity investigation into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc just two days after it raised $4.4 billion in a New York initial public offering.
China's blue-chip CSI300 index hit a more than 10-week low and was last down 2.89%, the Shanghai Composite Index declined 2.18%, having earlier hit a two-month low and the Shenzhen Composite fell 2.2%. 
Both the Shanghai and Shenzhen indexes were hit by heavy foreign-investor selling. Refinitiv data showed outflows of 6.2 billion yuan ($956.24 million)from A-shares as of midday on Monday.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped to its weakest level since Dec. 29 and was last down 2.91%. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index fell 3.66%. 
Government efforts to rein in an overheated property sector also spooked investors on Monday, sending the CSI 300 Real Estate index down 4.82%, while the Hang Seng Properties index fell 2.32%.
Media reports that China's central bank has ordered lenders in Shanghai to raise the rate of mortgage loans for first-time homebuyers followed a statement from the housing ministry on Friday that China will strive to clean up irregularities in the property market in three years.
Shares in China Evergrande Group, the heavily indebted developer whose financing difficulties have stoked broader apprehensions about the outlook for the property sector, fell 7%. Evergrande shares have fallen by a third this month, and are down more than 54% this year.
Fellow developer Country Garden Holdings Co dropped 2.18%.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares skidded to seven-month lows on Monday as regulation concerns upended Chinese equities and strong U.S. corporate earnings sucked funds out of emerging markets into Wall Street.
Chinese blue chips shed 2.4% to their lowest in 10 weeks as the education and property sectors were routed on worries over tighter government rules.
That dragged MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 1.4% to its lowest since early January. Japan's Nikkei did bounce 1.4%, but that was off a seven-month low.
In contrast, Nasdaq futures were steady near historic highs, though S&P 500 futures eased 0.3%. EUROSTOXX 50 futures and FTSE futures both dipped 0.5%.
More than one-third of S&P 500 companies are set to report quarterly results this week, headlined by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
With just over one-fifth of the S&P 500 having reported, 88% of firms have beaten the consensus of analysts' expectations. That is a major reason global money managers have poured more than $900 billion into U.S. funds in the first half of 2021.
Oliver Jones, a senior markets economist at Capital Economics, noted U.S. earnings were projected to be roughly 50% higher in 2023 than they were in the year immediately prior to the pandemic, significantly more than was anticipated in most other major economies.
""With so much optimism baked in, it seems likely to us that the tailwind of rising earnings forecasts, which provided so much support to the stock market over the past year, will fade,"" he cautioned.
The week is also packed with U.S. data that should underline the economy's outperformance. Second-quarter gross domestic product is forecast to show annualised growth of 8.6%, while the Fed's favoured measure of core inflation is seen rising an annual 3.7% in June.
The Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday and Wednesday and, while no change in policy is expected, Chair Jerome Powell will likely be pressed to clarify what ""substantial further progress"" on employment would look like.
""The main message from Fed Chair Powell’s post-meeting press conference should be consistent with his testimony before Congress in mid-July when he signalled no rush for tapering,"" said NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI).
""However, he will clearly remind market participants that the taper countdown has officially begun.""
So far, the bond market has been remarkably untroubled by the prospect of eventual tapering with yields on U.S. 10-year notes having fallen for four weeks in a row to stand at 1.26%.
The drop has done little to undermine the dollar, in part because European yields have fallen even further amid expectations of continued massive bond buying by the European Central Bank.
The single currency has been trending lower since June and touched a four-month trough of $1.1750 last week. It was last at $1.1775 and looked at risk of testing its 2021 low of $1.1702.
The dollar has also been edging up on the yen to reach 110.40, but remains short of its recent peak at 111.62. The fall in the euro has lifted the dollar index to 92.870, a long way from its May trough of 89.533.
The rise in the dollar has offset the drop in bond yields to leave gold range-bound around $1,800 an ounce.

Oil prices have generally fared better amid wagers that demand will remain strong as the global economy gradually opens and supply stays tight. [O/R]

The move comes after AMP decided in April to spin off its asset management arm's private markets business and focus on its wealth management units following U.S.-based Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) Corp's failed bid to buy the whole company.
Under the new model, AMP will introduce a fresh service and fee structure for its advisers and stop owning client relationships. It will instead release ""institutional ownership from AMP Financial Planning to advisers"", it said.
AMP will also conclude arrangements that allowed it to buy back client books from licensed financial planners from the end of this year, after the securities regulator began investigation into an alleged fees-for-no-service conduct by its financial planning unit.
""The new model releases institutional ownership. Buyback arrangements will also cease, with advisers having between now and the end of the year to make the decision to leave the network under their existing arrangements,"" said Matt Lawler, managing director of Advice at AMP.

The embattled wealth manager will phase in a new ""service proposition and fee model for advice practices"" for its clients between January 2022 and January 2023, it said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning as a technology-sector crackdown in China and the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision, lingered on investors’ minds.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.39% by 10:29 PM ET (2:29 AM GMT), with markets reopening after a holiday and the services purchasing managers’ index released earlier in the day.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.30% and in Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.13%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 2.13%, with the Hang Seng Tech Index, which offers exposure to China’s internet giants, currently the worst-performing major tech gauge globally.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1.32% and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.42%, with China releasing plans to reform the $100 billion education sector, one of country’s hottest investment plays in recent years, over the weekend.
Tensions with the U.S. were also high as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi hold their first high-level U.S.-China talks since March 2021. As the talks began earlier in the day, Chinese foreign vice-minister Xie Feng told Sherman that relations between the two countries had reached a “stalemate” and faced “serious consequences”, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement.
U.S. shares steadied after closing at record levels on Friday, boosted by a U.S. earnings season that has beaten expectations. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  . (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are among the heavyweights who will report earnings throughout the week. U.S. Treasuries remained little changed.
Investors are now bracing for possible turbulence ahead of the Fed’s latest policy decision, due to be handed down on Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to say that it will start scaling back its asset purchases, including $120 billion in monthly bond purchases, in 2022 and hike interest rates at a quicker-than-expected rate through 2024.
However, some investors believed that the Fed would maintain its current dovish stance whilst starting a countdown towards asset tapering.

""However, he will clearly remind market participants that the taper countdown has officially begun,” he added.
Investors remained cautiously optimistic as the week opened and as they look ahead to U.S. second-quarter GDP data due on Thursday.
“The macro narrative remains one of a post-COVID-19 recovery,” AXA Investment Managers chief investment officer for core investments Chris Iggo said in a note.
However, lingering concerns about the ongoing spread of COVID-19 globally mean bouts of market volatility will remain. “Continued pandemic risk is likely to be a recurring source of ‘risk-off’ events in the financial markets,” said Iggo’s note."
1673,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 25, 2021 10:36PM ET</span>",Chinese Tutoring Firms Extend Plunge as Beijing Cracks Down,"(Bloomberg) -- A selloff in Chinese private education companies deepened on Monday after Beijing announced a sweeping overhaul that threatens to up-end the $100 billion sector and jeopardize billions of dollars in foreign investment.
New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. plunged as much as 40%, extending Friday’s record 41% fall and after its U.S. traded shares dropped 54%. It warned in a Monday stock exchange filing that the regulations will have a material adverse impact on the company. Koolearn Technology Holding Ltd. tumbled as much as 35%, the biggest drag on the Hang Seng Tech Index, which fell 4% to its lowest since September 2020. China Maple Leaf Educational Systems Ltd. dropped 16%.
Chinese regulators on Saturday published reforms that will fundamentally alter the business model of private firms teaching the school curriculum, as Beijing aims to overhaul a sector it says has been “hijacked by capital.” The new regulations ban firms that teach school curriculums from making profits, raising capital or going public. Friday was already a bloodbath for the sector in both Hong Kong and the U.S., after a document on curbing tutoring firms from going public circulated on social media.
The “worst-case became a reality,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) analysts including DS Kim wrote in a note dated Saturday, saying it was uncertain whether the companies could remain listed under the new regime. “It’s unclear what level of restructuring the companies should undergo with a new regime and, in our view, this makes these stocks virtually un-investable.”
Worst Case Emerging for China Tutors After Overhaul: Street Wrap
Elsewhere the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slumped as much as 3.2%. The gauge was poised for its lowest since October, as investors continue to price in the risks of China’s crackdowns on industries from tech to real estate and education firms.
Companies that teach school subjects can no longer accept overseas investment, which could include capital from the offshore registered entities of Chinese firms, according to a notice released by the State Council. Those now in violation of that rule must take steps to rectify the situation, the country’s most powerful administrative authority said, without elaborating.
In addition, listed firms will no longer be allowed to raise capital via stock markets to invest in businesses that teach classroom subjects. Outright acquisitions are forbidden. All vacation and weekend tutoring related to the school syllabus is now off-limits.
“Curriculum tutoring firms should remodel their businesses or even switch to a different industry as soon as possible,” said Jiang Ya, an analyst with Citic Securities Ltd. “These measures are just the beginning and there is potentially an abundance of follow-up policies and continued tight regulation.”
Education technology had emerged as one of the hottest investment plays in China in recent years, attracting billions from the likes of Tiger Global Management, Temasek Holdings Pte and SoftBank Group Corp.
New Oriental and TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) may incur losses that exceed downside-case scenarios if both tutoring companies halve student fees to meet Beijing’s guidelines, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Catherine Lim in a note.
There are more than 20 education companies that are listed in Hong Kong with a combined market cap of HK$187 billion ($24 billion) after Friday’s drop. Short selling volume of the biggest education firm, New Oriental Education, surged by more than 8,000% on Friday, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.

News of the rule changes on Friday sent shockwaves through China's $120 billion private tutoring sector and triggered a massive sell-off in the shares of companies including U.S.-listed TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) and Gaotu Techedu.
Under the new rules, all institutions offering tutoring on the school curriculum will be registered as non-profit organisations, and no new licences will be granted, according to an official document.
TAL said in its statement on Sunday that it expects the new rules to have ""material adverse impact on its after-school tutoring services ... which in turn may adversely affect"" its operations and prospects. It did not elaborate.
TAL's New York-listed shares plunged 71% on Friday.
New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc, Koolearn Technology Holding Ltd, Scholar Education Group, and China Beststudy Education Group made similar statements on Monday.
China's education industry sub-index dropped 8% in Monday morning trade, while Hong Kong-listed shares of New Oriental, Koolearn, Scholar Education and China Beststudy tumbled between 30% and 40%.
China's for-profit education sector has been under scrutiny as part of Beijing's push to ease pressure on school children and reduce a cost burden on parents that has contributed to a drop in birth rates. 
""The company is considering appropriate compliance measures to be taken, and expects such measures to have material adverse impact on its afterschool tutoring services...,"" New Oriental Education said in a statement.
Online education services provider Koolearn, which expects its after-school tutoring services to be affected, said it will comply with the relevant rules when providing educational services.
Scholar Education said authorities had yet to provide details around the implementation of the rules and there were uncertainties as to when and how such rules will become specifically applicable to the group. 
""I personally have always stayed away from the education sector as regulations have been changing erratically for many years,"" said Dave Wang, portfolio manager at Nuvest Capital in Singapore.
""But the broader view is that the Chinese government has always been more particular on sectors that have widespread social implications. The increasing difficulty for investors and companies is that the boundary seems to be extending ... (and) no one knows what might be next.""

In May, China said it would allow couples to have up to three children, from two previously. 
""The company is in communication with the regulatory authority and will make appropriate adjustment of its business model whenever needed to ensure the compliance with the new policies under the opinions,"" China Beststudy Education said.

The move comes after Victoria state last month said it would give additional time and funding to a separate Royal Commission that is probing Crown's operations in that state, to allow it to investigate a wider range of matters.
The ongoing inquiries into Crown are to assess its fitness for holding gambling licences in various Australian cities after media accused the company, one-third owned by billionaire James Packer, of ties to money laundering.
A final report from Western Australia was initially expected in mid-November, but will now be delivered on March 4, 2022.

Demand for NdPr and other rare earth materials has rebounded from a pandemic-driven drop last year as electric vehicles continue to gain popularity amid a global push to reduce carbon emissions.
NdPr is also used in magnets for windfarms, gadgets like smartphones, and military equipment, and Lynas and other western producers stand to benefit from efforts by the United States to curb its reliance on China for the specialized minerals.
""Demand for Lynas products, in particular for our NdPr product family, continued to be very strong through the quarter, leading to record sales and cash collection,"" Chief Executive Officer Amanda Lacaze said in a statement.
Lacaze said a drop in prices during the quarter was due to ""normal correction after the sharp and speculative increases seen in the previous months"" and added that prices had strengthened again in July.
The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of A$185.9 million ($136.97 million), well above A$38 million a year earlier and higher than the prior record of A$119.4 million.
Lynas produced 1,393 tonnes of NdPr in the quarter, up from 775 tonnes a year ago. Its full product range garnered an average selling price of A$39.1/kg, up from A$20.2/kg last year.

Lynas also said it had identified a second potential site in Malaysia to build a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility amid ongoing delays for clearance of an earlier site identified by the Pahang state government.

""Everybody involved has agreed to settle and this matter is now closed,"" Simone Meier said, confirming a report in Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag.
A spokesman for Khan said his client did not wish to comment. UBS, where Khan is now co-president of global wealth management, declined to comment. 
The agreement, details of which have not been disclosed, ends a dispute that rocked the normally sedate world of Swiss banking when allegations of corporate espionage involving  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) emerged in September 2019. 
The affair became public when Khan, after defecting to UBS, confronted a private detective who was following him and his wife through Zurich.
What Credit Suisse initially described as a rogue spying case run by then-Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee widened as details emerged of other instances of surveillance.
As well as the departures of Bouee and Thiam, a private investigator who organised the surveillance committed suicide after the affair came to light.
The NZZ am Sonntag said the settlement would see the withdrawal of the criminal complaints Khan had filed against the bank and the private detectives.

""The investigations associated with the criminal charges will be discontinued,"" Erich Wenzinger, spokesman for the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in the Canton of Zurich, told the newspaper.

Unifor issued a 72-hour strike notice on Wednesday after nearly seven weeks of unproductive talks over proposed changes to workers' retirement benefits and unresolved grievances.
In an emailed statement to Reuters, a spokesperson for the miner said that the union refused the company’s proposal to request the intervention of a mediator. 
""Rio Tinto has made every effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement through negotiating with Unifor over the past seven weeks, and will continue to do so,"" the company said in the statement.
The union represents about 900 workers at the miner's aluminium smelting plant in Kitimat and power generating facility in Kemano.
""Rio Tinto was given every opportunity to reach a fair deal but showed complete disregard for our issues,"" the union said in a statement. 

Unifor said it was committed to resolving the labour dispute amicably and urged the company's management to reach a fair settlement. 
The company said that required staff and employees are now taking on operational duties to ensure the smelter and powerhouse continue to function safely. Rio had earlier sought an order from the province's labour relations board declaring power plant workers essential, according to a union bulletin.

""The goal is to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2022, with... over 2 billion euros in direct consolidated revenues,"" Chairman and CEO Giorgio Armani said on Sunday in a statement announcing 2020 results and the trend for January-June.
The luxury group said consolidated net sales had fallen 25% last year to 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion), with most of the decline occurring in the first half of 2020.
Luxury goods sales around the world fell sharply last year for the first time in years as the pandemic forced shop closures and brought international tourism to a virtual halt.
""The drop in revenues in 2020 should be read not only as a consequence of the pandemic... but also in line with Giorgio Armani's own strategic principle of 'less is more',"" said Armani Deputy Managing Director Giuseppe Marsocci.
The Milan-based group did not give the value of total sales in January-June but said the positive sales trend so far this year pointed to a much better profitability scenario for 2021. 
For the whole of last year the group made a consolidated net profit of 90 million euros but an operating loss (EBIT) of 29 million euros. 
It also said on Sunday that its financial position improved significantly in the first half with net cash and cash equivalents of 1.088 billion euros ""ensuring the financial resources necessary for the Group's medium to long-term stability and growth"".
Speculation about succession plans at Armani has come to the fore recently, especially after the 87-year-old designer said he could consider teaming up with another Italian company. 

Sources told Reuters earlier this month that John Elkann, scion of Italy's Agnelli family, had explored a possible tie-up as part of plans to build a luxury conglomerate.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2021 08:52PM ET</span>",Robinhood CEO says he is considering offering U.S. retirement accounts,"By Echo Wang and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Robinhood Markets Inc is considering launching U.S. retirement accounts, CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev said on Saturday in a webcast with users of its trading app looking to participate in its initial public offering, which is set to price next week.
The online brokerage has about 18 million funded investment accounts on its platform, most of which are held by retail traders.
Offering individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Roth IRAs, which offer tax advantages to those saving for retirement, would allow Robinhood to tap a vast market. Americans held $12.6 trillion in IRAs at the end of March, up 2.8% from the end of December, according to the Investment Company Institute.
""We are interested in building more account types, including IRAs and Roth IRAs, we've been hearing that a lot from our customers. We want to make first-time investors into long-term investors,"" Tenev said in response to an investor question.
Due to the penalties involved in withdrawing money, IRAs tend to attract long-term investments, rather than the quick flip in stocks, options and cryptocurrencies that some investors turn to Robinhood for.
In his webcast, however, Tenev said: ""We see evidence that the majority of our customers are primarily buy and hold.""
Robinhood, which is targeting a valuation of up to $35 billion in its IPO, has said it will allocate 20% to 35% of shares offered to its users, an unusual move for a high-profile offering. One of the reasons many IPOs enjoy a first-day trading pop is because the retail investors that Robinhood has invited are excluded and must buy shares in the open market.
Robinhood launched its IPO Access platform earlier this year to enable users to buy into the IPOs of other companies if it can negotiate deals with the investment banks handling them.
Some individual investors are calling for a boycott of Robinhood's IPO on Reddit and other social media over its handling of the 'meme' stock-trading frenzy in January. Robinhood placed restrictions on buying  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other stocks that hedge funds had bet against, on grounds it was needed for the financial and operational stability of its platform.
Tenev said in Saturday's webcast that Robinhood had invested in the stability of its platform to avoid another such incident.
PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW
Robinhood's popularity has soared over the past 18 months of coronavirus-induced social restrictions that have kept many retail investors at home. It has said its mission is to ""democratize finance for all"" by allowing users to make unlimited commission-free trades in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options and cryptocurrencies.
The brokerage has been criticized for relying on ""payment for order flow"" for most of its revenue, under which it receives fees from market makers for routing trades to them and does not charge users for individual trades, however.
Critics argue the practice, which is used by many other brokers, creates a conflict of interest, on the grounds that it incentivizes brokers to send orders to whoever pays the higher fees. Robinhood contends that it routes trades based on what is cheapest for its users, and that charging a commission would be more expensive.
Robinhood chief financial officer Jason Warnick left the door open for the company to change the practice if necessary.
""If a ban or other limitations on it were to be imposed, we believe Robinhood and the industry would adapt and explore other revenue sources,"" Warnick said.
Robinhood was founded in 2013 by Stanford University roommates Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, who will hold nearly two-thirds of the voting power after the offering, a filing with the stock exchange showed.

Robinhood customer Minjie Xu, who works as a software engineer in Missouri, remained unimpressed after the presentation on concerns the offering was overpriced.
""This is not unique to them, as I think most IPOs are overpriced,"" Xu told Reuters.

(Reuters) -A U.S. federal judge has ruled that Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp may conduct excavation work at its Thacker Pass lithium mine site in Nevada, denying a request from environmentalists who said the digging could harm sage grouse and other wildlife.
The ruling marked a rare win for a U.S. critical minerals project as environmental groups increasingly pressure courts and regulators to block mining projects, even if they produce metals key to building electric vehicles.
Chief Judge Miranda Du of the federal court in Reno, Nevada, said late on Friday that the digging - needed to determine whether the land holds historical import for Native Americans - may proceed while she determines the broader question of whether former President Donald Trump's administration erred when it approved the project in January. Du said she will try to publish her decision by early 2022.
Vancouver, Canada-based Lithium Americas had agreed not to dig before July 29 while Du deliberated. It was not immediately clear if the company now intends to start digging on that date. Company representatives could not be reached for comment.
The land that would be affected amounts to less than a quarter of an acre on a project roughly 18,000 acres in size, a factor which Du said affected her decision.
Additionally, Du said, environmental groups could not prove what specific damage would be caused by the digging, only hypothetical guesses. Environmentalists ""failed to meet their burden to show they will be irreparably harmed,"" Du said.

""We are disappointed in the court's ruling allowing the company to dig up and remove cultural and historical artifacts,"" said Kelly Fuller of the Western Watersheds Project, one of the environmental groups that sued to block the project.
Fuller said the group looks forward to a hearing with Du in the future to argue the entire project should be canceled.

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co and its Cruise robo-taxi subsidiary said early Saturday they have asked a U.S. federal court to stop Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co from using the name ""BlueCruise"" to market its hands-free driving technology.
In a statement and documents released shortly after midnight Detroit time, GM said Ford's use of the BlueCruise name infringed on GM's Super Cruise and other GM trademarks for automated driving, such as Hyper Cruise, as well as Cruise's trademarks.
""While GM had hoped to resolve the trademark infringement matter with Ford amicably, we were left with no choice but to vigorously defend our brands and protect the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market,"" GM said in its statement.
Ford, in a statement, called GM and Cruise's claim ""meritless and frivolous.""
""Drivers for decades have understood what cruise control is, every automaker offers it, and 'cruise' is common shorthand for the capability,"" it said.
Ford noted that GM has not taken action against other companies that use the word ""cruise"" in marketing names used to describe automated driving systems.
Automakers are racing to deploy technology to enable drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel in traffic jams or on highways. The so-called Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's semi-automated Autopilot technology, are not supposed to allow drivers to fully disengage from driving for extended periods.
Automakers have used the word ""cruise"" for decades to describe cruise control systems which allow drivers to set a speed the car will maintain, usually in highway driving.
GM's complaint argues that ""automated driving is not cruise control.""
GM announced in 2012 it would use the name Super Cruise for its hands-free driver assistance technology. It has been marketing the technology using that name since 2017. 
GM's majority-owned Cruise self-driving vehicle unit has been operating since 2013.
Ford announced it would use the name BlueCruise https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-offer-hands-free-driving-some-car-truck-models-later-this-year-2021-04-14 for its hands-free driving technology in April this year.

In their complaint, GM's lawyers state the automaker engaged in ""protracted discussions"" with Ford before deciding to go to court.
GM contends Ford's BlueCruise system ""is far less advanced than Cruise’s technology and thus likely to yield an inferior consumer experience, with the potential for comfort and safety issues"" that could tarnish the Super Cruise brand.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2021 01:35AM ET</span>",China regulator bars Tencent from exclusive rights in online music,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's market regulator on Saturday said it would bar Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd from exclusive music copyright agreements and fined the company for unfair market practices in the online music market after its acquisition of China Music Corporation.
The Chinese government has been stepping up antitrust actions in recent months against the country's large tech companies, including a record $2.75 billion fine on e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) for engaging in anti-competitive behaviour.
Tencent and  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME), the unit created from the acquisition, said they would abide by the decision and comply with all regulatory requirements.
The State Administration Of Market Regulation (SAMR) said it had investigated Tencent's activities in the online music broadcasting platform market in China, in which music copyright is the core asset, in a notice posted on its official website. 
Reuters reported in mid-July that the antitrust regulator would order Tencent's music streaming arm to give up exclusive rights to music labels that it has used to compete with smaller rivals, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
Tencent held more than 80% of exclusive music library resources after its acquisitions, the regulator said, increasing its leverage over upstream copyright parties and allowing it to restrict new entrants, the regulator said.
SAMR said Tencent and its affiliated companies must not engage in exclusive copyright agreements with upstream owners of such rights, while existing agreements must be terminated within 30 days of the regulatory notice.
The regulator also ordered Tencent to pay a fine of 500,000 yuan ($77,150).

Earlier this month, the regulator said it would block Tencent's plan to merge the country's top two videogame streaming sites, Huya (NYSE:HUYA) and DouYu , on antitrust grounds.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street gained ground for the fourth straight session on Friday, extending a rally that pushed all three major U.S. stock indexes to record closing highs as upbeat earnings and signs of economic revival fueled investor risk appetite.
The Dow closed above 35,000 for the first time ever.
""We see a continuation of the last couple days. It's roller coaster in reverse. We did the drop first, and we’ve been climbing back to the top ever since,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Growth and value stocks seesawed for much of the week as market participants weighed spiking infections of the COVID-19 Delta variant against strong corporate results and signs of economic revival.
""There’s push and pull, there’s clearly conflict in the market,"" Zaccarelli added. ""There’s a strong difference of opinion as to whether the future’s bright or whether there are clouds on the horizon.""
Market participants now look toward next week with the Federal Reserve's two-day monetary policy meeting and a series of high-profile earnings.
The Fed's statement will be parsed for clues regarding the timeframe for tightening its accommodative policies, although Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly said the economy still needs the central bank's full support.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 238.2 points, or 0.68%, to 35,061.55, the S&P 500 gained 44.31 points, or 1.01%, to 4,411.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 152.39 points, or 1.04%, to 14,836.99.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but energy closed green, with communications services enjoying the largest gain, rising 2.7%.
Second-quarter reporting season is in full swing, with 120 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 88% have beaten consensus, according to Refinitiv.
""We’re seeing companies, on average, beat on the top and on the bottom line,"" Zaccarelli said. ""We’re seeing the resilience of the consumer and that’s been the story of the earnings season so far.""
Analysts now expect aggregate year-on-year S&P 500 earnings growth of 78.1% for the April to June period, a sizeable increase from the 54% annual growth seen at the beginning of the quarter.
Chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) said late Thursday that it still faces supply constraints and provided disappointing guidance. Its stock fell 5.3%.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc jumped 7.8% after the European Union approved its COVID-19 vaccine for 12- to 17-year-olds.
 American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) gained 1.3% after posting second-quarter profit that handily beat expectations on the strength of a global recovery in consumer spending.
Social media firms  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) advanced 3.0% and 23.8%, respectively, on the back of their upbeat results.
Those results bode well for  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which is due to post second-quarter results next week. Its stock surged 5.3%.
Other high-profile earnings expected next week include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Industrials  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD), 3M Co  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), along with a host of healthcare, consumer goods and others, are also on deck.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 81 new highs and 136 new lows.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 06:20PM ET</span>","Global insurance recovery will be faster, stronger than in 2008 -Swiss Re","By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The global insurance industry is poised to recover more quickly and forcefully from the pandemic than it did after the 2008 financial crisis, despite such obstacles as low interest rates and inflation risk, insurer Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) AG's chief Americas economist said on Friday.
Unlike the prior crisis, the pandemic did not weaken insurers' overall capitalization or financial strength, which allows companies to write new coverage and increase revenue, economist Thomas Holzheu told Reuters. 
Writing new policies was more difficult in 2009 and 2010 when insurers were reeling from capital losses, slow economic growth and depleted incomes of companies and individuals.
In contrast, businesses and individuals now have more money from government stimulus and support programs, and are more conscious of the need to buy protection against risks, he added.
""We see a much stronger, more resilient demand for insurance - last year, this year, and we expect for the next few years - compared with the financial crisis, when the industry was a part of the financial markets issues,"" he said.
Swiss Re's view aligns with other bullish signs. Global commercial insurance prices, for example, rose 18% in the first quarter of 2021 from a year earlier, on average, insurance broker Marsh McLennan (NYSE:MMC) Cos Inc said in May. Rates have risen since late 2017.
Swiss Re said it expects annual growth for all premiums, not just commercial, to reach 3.3% this year and 3.9% in 2022, after falling just 1.3% last year. That compares with a 3.7% decline in 2008, during the financial crisis, and a slower rebound of 0.5% and 2.1% in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

Sector bellwether Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) Inc on Tuesday beat second-quarter Wall Street estimates by more than $1.00 a share. 
Other large U.S. insurers are due to report results over the next two weeks.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 06:17PM ET</span>",Big tech companies retake market reins with earnings on tap,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The rally on Wall Street faces a fresh test next week with a flood of earnings reports from major U.S. companies, including the tech and internet behemoths that have recently retaken leadership of the market.
More than one third of the S&P 500 is set to report quarterly results next week, headlined by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the four largest U.S. companies by market value.
Those stocks have gained between 5-7% so far this month, as of Thursday's close, while the S&P 500 had climbed just 1.6%. The S&P 500 equal-weight index, a barometer of the average stock, had fallen 0.2%.
""The expectation level for these names is quite a bit higher than it was a month ago given the stock performance, so I think they are going to have to deliver,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. 
""It’s a question of looking forward: Can they live up to the expectations that the stock prices reflect?""
The strength in those large stocks has come amid concerns about a slowing U.S. economic recovery that have helped pushed down benchmark Treasury yields this week to their lowest levels since February, before rebounding some. 
As the Delta variant of COVID-19 sweeps through the United States, the economic outlook will be in sharp focus at the Federal Reserve's meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, another pivotal event for investors seeking clues for when the central bank might rein in its easy money policies.
Though the S&P 500 stands at record levels after rallying more than 95% from its March 2020 lows, stocks have endured more volatility in recent days as investors seek to reconcile bond-market signals about the economic outlook. 
Indeed, below the surface, stock performance indicates some doubts about economic strength. Growth stocks, which led the market for years as the economy grew sluggishly, have outperformed economically-sensitive value stocks in July, while smaller stocks, which tend to have more exposure to the U.S. economy, have also lagged, with the small-cap Russell 2000 down over 4% so far this month.
“Investors have... sought safety in those megacaps, particularly the megacap tech companies, which are expected to continue to deliver very strong growth,” said Tim Skiendzielewski, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Philadelphia.
The dominance of the megacap stocks also raises concerns that the broader index may be more dependent on the fortunes of a few giant technology-related companies. 
The market cap of five companies -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) -- recently stood at 24.6% of the S&P 500's market cap, nearly the highest proportion it has been in 2021.
Fewer than half of the stocks in the S&P 500 recently traded above their 50-day moving averages even as the index has been at or near new highs, compared to over 90% in April, a sign that ""what is happening beneath the surface is at odds with the picture of strength that is portrayed if one just looks at the popular averages,"" according to Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist with market research firm All Star Charts.
At the same time, bullish investors can point to a strong start for an earnings season that has been expected to show a powerful rebound from the pandemic. With 120 S&P 500 companies having reported so far, second-quarter earnings are expected to have jumped 78.1% from a year ago, up from an expectation of 65.4% at the start of the month, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Other heavyweights reporting next week include Facebook, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Visa (NYSE:V),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE). With concerns about the strength of the economy, investors will focus on corporate expectations for the rest of the year and into 2022.
“We may not see many 70% earnings growth quarters going forward, but that still doesn’t mean that we are looking at negative earnings growth,"" said Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist with Commonwealth Financial Network. “Even if it moderates, it is still reflective of a healthy economic environment.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Getaround Inc will pay $950,000 to Washington, D.C. and revise its business practices after allegations that it misrepresented the benefits and nature of its car sharing services and failed to pay city sales taxes, officials said on Friday.
The Softbank-backed San Francisco-based online company had operated without a license in the U.S capital, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement.
Getaround will pay restitution to car owners who experienced theft or damage to vehicles listed on its site, Racine said.
Customers can use Getaround to rent vehicles by the hour or day from individual owners who make vehicles available through Getaround.
The settlement resolves ""what amounts to Getaround paying a tax bill it never disputed,"" Getaround said in a statement. The company added that ""as soon as Getaround was notified of security issues affecting certain cars in the District, the company took immediate corrective action.""
Car sharing services in Washington are subject to a 10.25% sales tax.
""Gig economy companies must abide by the same rules as their brick-and-mortar counterparts,"" Racine said. ""They must provide clear and accurate information to consumers, especially about the safety of their services, and they must pay their fair share of taxes like everyone else does.""
Racine's office began investigating Getaround in 2020 after it received reports of increased thefts of cars listed on Getaround.
The settlement resolves allegations Getaround misled consumers ""by using phony owner profiles for fleet cars actually owned by Getaround, Racine said.
In October, Getaround raised $140 million in additional venture capital funding. The company has raised nearly $600 million since it was founded in 2009 and in previous rounds was valued at more than $1.5 billion.
Getaround operates in over 100 U.S. cities and more than 850 cities worldwide.

Following the agreement, oil prices have declined approximately 8%. Because declining global demand could cause oil prices to fall further, we believe  Chevron  (CVX),  Pioneer Natural Resources  (PXD), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), and  Valero Energy  (VLO), which are trading at expensive valuations, could witness a price retreat soon. Let’s discuss.
On July 18, OPEC+ announced plans to increase crude oil production by 400,000 barrels each day beginning in August, following a week of internal conflict. The projected rise in supply, coupled with a decline in market demand amid a deceleration of the economic recovery and rising concerns regarding the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, has caused oil prices to slump lately. 
West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell below the critical $70 level on July 19. Oil prices in the United States settled at $66.42 per barrel on the same day, hitting a 10-month low. The gradual easing of the supply curbs is expected to continue to put pressure on oil prices.
Oil prices are expected to decline further in the near term owing to decelerating global demand with the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in several countries. Given this backdrop, oil stocks Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), Phillips 66 (PSX), and Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), which are currently trading at high valuations, might witness a pullback soon. Thus, we think these stocks are best avoided now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines wants the federal government to step in to address congestion problems at Newark Liberty International Airport as a runway repair project that began July 6 causes headaches for many summer travelers.
United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) asked Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Steve Dickson ""to temporarily and proportionally reduce the number of operations per hour at Newark while airport capacity is constrained by runway construction.""
Newark, which was the 15th busiest U.S. airport in 2020 by total passengers, has seen lengthy flight delays, long taxi delays and numerous cancellations in recent weeks.
United, which has a hub at the northern New Jersey airport, flies about 65% of all Newark flights.
In the July 15 letter, which has not been previously reported, Kirby said that during a six-day period in July ""the average number of (Newark) flight cancellations by all airlines was more than 100 flights per day"" which placed a ""severe strain on employees and operations.""
Kirby told regulators that United, which plans to resume a full schedule at Newark this fall, wants the FAA to step in to ensure that flight reductions are shared equitably among the airlines who fly in and out of the airport. He did not advocate returning to slot controls like those at New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports, however.
Kirby asked FAA to ""bring together all relevant parties to reduce the number of flights per hour temporarily and proportionally during July, August, and September.""
An FAA spokeswoman said the agency is ""reviewing the letter and will respond directly to"" United.
United said it supported the need of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to work on the runways now, when traffic remains below pre-pandemic levels.
But, Kirby added, ""it is well established that Newark has consistently been the worst-performing airport in the country from an air traffic perspective over the past few years.""
He added that ""During the 15-year period from 2005 to 2019, Newark was the most delayed core airport in the system for 10 of those years.""

The Port Authority did not immediately comment on Kirby's letter.
United is cancelling about 70 of its current 240 scheduled flights a day at Newark since the runway construction began, airline officials said. Pre-pandemic it flew about 430 flights a day.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Tesla Inc is likely to set up a factory in India if successful with imported vehicles, Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Twitter, after the company wrote to Indian ministries seeking a big reduction in import duties on electric vehicles, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.
The electric-car maker's pitch to lower duties, however, is likely to face resistance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration which has championed high import taxes for many industries in a bid to boost local manufacturing.
""We want to do so, but import duties are the highest in the world by far of any large country,"" Musk said in reply to a tweet about launching the company's cars in India. (https:// ""But we are hopeful that there will be at least a temporary tariff relief for electric vehicles,"" Musk added. Other luxury automakers in India have also lobbied the government in the past to lower taxes on imported cars but have had little success due to opposition from rivals with domestic operations. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which aims to begin sales in India this year, said in a letter to ministries and the country's leading think-tank Niti Aayog that slashing federal taxes on imports of fully assembled electric cars to 40% would be more appropriate, according to the sources. That compares with current rates of 60% for cars priced below $40,000 and 100% for those above $40,000. ""The argument is that at 40% import duty, electric cars can become more affordable but the threshold is still high enough to compel companies to manufacture locally if demand picks up,"" one of the sources said. The sources declined to be identified as the letter has not been made public. According to Tesla's U.S. website, only one model - the Model 3 Standard Range Plus - is priced below $40,000. Niti Aayog did not respond to an email seeking comment. Ministries that Tesla wrote to included the transport and heavy industries ministries, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Indian market for premium EVs, indeed for electric cars in general, is still very much in its infancy with vehicles far too costly for the average consumer and very little charging infrastructure in place. Just 5,000 of the 2.4 million cars sold in India last year were electric and most were priced below $28,000. Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes Benz began selling its EQC luxury EV in India last year for $136,000, and Audi launched three electric SUVs this week with sticker tags that begin at around $133,000. While lower duties would give Tesla a better chance to test the market, its plan to begin sales in India does not hinge on a change in government policy, both sources said. 
Tesla registered a local company in India in January and has ramped up local hiring while also scouting for showroom space. India's transport minister Nitin Gadkari told Reuters in March that India would be willing to offer incentives to ensure Tesla's cost of production in the country is less than that in China, but only if it manufactures locally.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A wild week in Treasuries has investors parsing the cross-currents that may sway prices for U.S. government bonds in coming weeks, including the Federal Reserve, economic data and investor positioning.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury, which moves inversely to bond prices, recently stood at 1.28% on Friday, after falling as low as 1.128% earlier in the week, nearly 65 basis points below its 2021 high on worries over slowing growth and spreading COVID-19 infections.
Flows into the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond (NYSE:IEF) ETF hit around $1.2 billion in the week ending July 21, their highest in a year according to Lipper, illustrating the demand for U.S. government bonds.
One of the key questions now hanging over markets is whether Treasury yields will continue moving toward 1% - revisiting the levels they touched during the pandemic - or rebound toward 2%, a level many participants expected to see by year-end. 
Here are some indicators investors are watching to determine the course of the Treasury market.

TAPERING TALK
The Federal Reserve surprised many market participants with a hawkish shift at its June policy meeting, with its so-called dot-plot showing some officials moving up expectations of their first rate hikes to 2023. 
With the Fed’s policy meeting concluding on July 28 and the central bank’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole scheduled for late August, investors will be watching for signs that officials are backpedaling on assurances that the current bout of inflation is transitory, a message that could rattle markets.
Investors will also be looking for signals on whether officials believe the Delta variant of COVID-19 may pressure growth, potentially delaying the unwinding of the Fed’s easy-money policies and depressing yields.

YIELD SPREADS
While Treasury yields have slid, the spread between Treasuries and high-yield bonds has remained steady. That suggests that some investors remain bullish on the economy overall, while short-term factors such as positioning and supply are driving the rally in Treasuries, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), in a report.

While net speculative bets on 10-year Treasury futures flipped into bullish territory for the week ended July 13, those on other maturities, including 30-years, remained bearish, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. 
A reversal in that positioning could fuel Treasury gains and drag yields lower.

ECONOMIC DATA 
While the economy continues to rebound from last year’s swoon, worries that the pace of growth is slowing contributed to the rally in Treasuries earlier this week. 
Citigroup’s U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which measures the degree to which the data is beating or missing economists’ forecasts, stands at 11.6, compared with its record high of 270.8 touched in 2020.
Praveen Koropaty, U.S. interest rate strategist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), believes the Fed will want to see the employment reports from July, August and September before committing to an unwinding of its easy money policies.
At some point in November or December, “the Fed will announce a taper and I don't think the market will freak out as it will be well telegraphed,” he said.

BREAKEVEN INFLATION RATES

Breakeven rates - the spread in the yield between a Treasury note and a Treasury Inflation Protected Security of the same duration - are narrowing, a sign that investors are showing more faith in the Federal Reserve's estimate that high inflation will be transitory, wrote Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler. 
""The rout in commodity markets and pullback in reflation momentum is giving the Fed’s forecast additional credibility,"" he said.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 05:01PM ET</span>","U.S. stock markets hit new highs, Treasury yields up as choppy week ends","By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - All three major U.S. stock indexes closed at record highs on Friday after a rocky week in which investors fretted over the Delta coronavirus variant and cheered an economic recovery, while U.S. Treasury yields rose before a Federal Reserve meeting next week. 
Megacap tech stocks and positive corporate earnings helped drive main U.S. indexes up again. Yields on U.S. Treasuries were also up, as was the dollar, with investors eyeing next week's Federal Reserve meeting for hints on the U.S. economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and when the central bank will pull back support for the economy.
""It's certainly been a really strong run. For now it looks justified based on the strong earnings results. We got interest rate stability, which was helpful. As the economic recovery continues, as long as people are continuing to get out there despite the Delta variant, we think stocks can go higher,"" said Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist for LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). ""We think the ride will get bumpier in the second half, but we think the bull market continues."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 238.2 points, or 0.68%, to close the week at 35,061.55, while the S&P 500 gained 44.31 points, or 1.01%, to 4,411.79. The Nasdaq Composite added 152.39 points, or 1.04%, to close at 14,836.99. 
The greenback on Friday booked a second week of gains after a volatile few days as risk appetite waxed and waned. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was slightly higher on the day at 92.894. That was off a 3-1/2-month high of 93.194 hit on Wednesday.
For the week, it was up 0.1%, after rising 0.6% previously.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes hovered around 1.3%, or almost 17 basis points higher than a five-month low set on Tuesday, but was still at the low end of a recent range. The benchmark note traded up 2.1 basis points to 1.288% after briefly rising above 1.3%.
""We're closing out the week on a very nice trade, and it's being driven by earnings primarily and earnings specifically in stocks that speak to the consumer, which is not a new story but it's a story that adds momentum to the trade in the second half of the year,"" said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny & Co LLC, the parent company for Strategic Board Solutions and Kenny's Commentary, a subscriber-based political and economic newsletter. 
After declining earlier in the trading session, oil was set to end the week slightly up.
Investors have been assuming ""things will improve, travel will increase,"" said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities. ""There are concerns about the Delta variant."" 
Graphic: S&P 500 stock index vs absolute change, daily: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykegajpg/stx2307.png 
Massocca added, ""If that thesis is thrown into jeopardy, it put a hitch in the 'giddy up' in the market.""
Some parts of the United States are implementing mask mandates again due to new COVID-19 cases, while others have not, leading to confusion.
U.S. business activity grew at a moderate pace for a second straight month in July amid supply constraints, suggesting a cooling in economic activity, a report from data firm IHS Markit showed on Friday.
Positive corporate earnings helped the stock market.  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) jumped 1.7% after posting second-quarter profit that beat expectations.
Social media firms  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) gained 3.8% and 24.5%, respectively, after their upbeat results. 

Financial markets have swung from one direction to another this week as investors try to assess what the surging Delta variant means for the world economy. 
After recording its steepest one-day drop since May on Monday, the S&P 500 stock index went on to post the biggest one-day jump since March a day later. Currency, bond and commodities markets have seen similar gyrations.

So, we believe popular truck manufacturing stocks Paccar (PCAR) and  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) are well-positioned to benefit from the rising demand. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.PACCAR Inc. (NASDAQ:PCAR) Bloomfield Hills, Mich. and Tata Motors Limited (TTM) are budding players in the international truck manufacturing space. PCAR designs and manufactures high-quality light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, advanced diesel engines, and related aftermarket parts. TTM is an India-based multinational automotive corporation engaged mainly in producing various types of commercial and passenger vehicles. Both companies provide information technology and vehicle financing services.
Cheaper borrowing rates and growing demand for products are incentivizing industries to ramp up production amid the easing of pandemic restrictions, thus creating a high demand for raw materials worldwide. This, in turn, is fueling the demand for heavy-duty trucks for interstate cargo transportation. The heavy-duty trucks market is expected to grow at a 7.3% CAGR to hit $280.54 billion by 2026. Based on their efficient truck portfolios and finance services, both PCAR and TTM are likely to benefit from the industry tailwinds.
But while PCAR lost 5.5% in price over the past three months, TTM surged 3.6%. In terms of their past six months’ performance, TTM is a clear winner with 1.6% gains versus PCAR’s negative returns. But, which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 04:21PM ET</span>","EV startup Rivian announces $2.5 billion funding round led by Amazon, Ford","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -Electric car startup Rivian said on Friday it has closed a $2.5 billion fundraising round led by investors Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) , Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and T. Rowe Price.
The announcement came the day after the California-based company said it was exploring building a second U.S. assembly plant. Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported on Thursday that Rivian's planned plant, dubbed ""Project Tera,"" will include battery cell production. 
“As we near the start of vehicle production, it’s vital that we keep looking forward and pushing through to Rivian’s next phase of growth,” Rivian Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said in a statement.
“This infusion of funds ... allows Rivian to scale new vehicle programs, expand our domestic facility footprint, and fuel international product rollout,” he added.
Rivian, which has a plant currently in Normal, Illinois, said it has raised about $10.5 billion to date. It will seek a valuation of well over $50 billion in a potential public listing later this year, a source previously told Reuters.
Automakers are racing to develop EVs as China, Europe and other countries and regions mandate lower carbon emissions. Rivian aims to compete when it rolls out its R1T pickup and R1S SUV, as well as a delivery van for Amazon.
Scaringe said in a letter to customers last week that COVID-19 had delayed the launch of its vehicles. The first deliveries of the R1T, previously slated for July, were pushed to September, while the R1S was delayed to autumn. 

Scaringe told Reuters last November that Rivian planned to follow the initial three vehicles with smaller models targeted at China and Europe where it may eventually build vehicles. 
In addition to Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund, Ford and funds managed by T. Rowe Price, Friday's funding round also was led by D1 Capital Partners. It also included participation by Third Point (NYSE:SPNT), Fidelity Management and Research Co, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue, Rivian said.
