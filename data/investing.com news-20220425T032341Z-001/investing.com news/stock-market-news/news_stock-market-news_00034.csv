""We are watching the situation, which is still very much evolving, but as we look out there are 7,000 737s that need to be replaced,"" Willis told the Airline Economic aircraft finance conference in Dublin.
""There may be some short-term volatility in the value of the aircraft, the 737, but I think over the long run there are some very powerful macro elements that are going to drive demand for all airplane types,"" he said."

“It’s still on the cards, we made that very clear,” Al-Jadaan told Bloomberg TV in an interview in Davos. “We will consider it, but I don’t think it’s going to be anytime soon.”
Aramco raised $29.4 billion in the world’s biggest-ever initial public offering, selling shares at 32 riyals each and overtaking  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). as the most valuable listed company.
The oil giant’s IPO ended up being very different from what Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had envisaged when he first floated the idea in 2016 with an ambition to raise as much as $100 billion.
Aramco offered less than 2% and opted for a local listing after global investors balked at its hopes of valuing the company at $2 trillion. Instead, Aramco relied heavily on local investors and funds from neighboring Gulf Arab monarchies.

LONDON (Reuters) - A BlackRock-backed (N:BLK) group aims to raise an initial $500 million for a private equity fund that will invest in climate change-linked infrastructure upgrades in emerging markets.
The group will provide the first $100 million of funding for the Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), which was set up in 2018 along with France, Germany and the Hewlett and Grantham charitable foundations, it said in a statement on Wednesday.
The funding will go toward a first-loss tranche that will absorb any initial losses, a safety net for other institutional investors that BlackRock expects to help it raise at least another $400 million. 
The CFP fund will be invested in renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage solutions and ultra-low and electric transport. At least a quarter of the investments would be made in Africa, with the rest in selected countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America, BlackRock said.
The venture is part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the way BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, is responding to the issue of climate change, as part of a broader commitment to environmental, social and governance-related investing.
Climate has also been at the forefront of this year's annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at which news of the planned initial fund-raising was announced.
Finding novel ways to encourage accelerated investments has been a theme at Davos, and on Wednesday a separate $500 million United Nations-backed initiative also announced a plan to help achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, 'SDG500'.
The money raised will target businesses in the agriculture, finance, energy, education and healthcare sectors across many of the regions worst-hit by climate change.
As with the CFP fund, the coalition of private and public sector organizations will also provide a first-loss layer for those investing in the project, which will provide exposure to six funds managed by asset manager Bamboo Partners. 
In a recent annual letter to the thousands of companies in which BlackRock holds stakes, Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said the need to act on climate was ""particularly urgent"" given many cities were not built to withstand ""the new climate reality"".
France and Germany will both invest $30 million of the initial funding, while the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust have pledged $10 million and $7.5 million, respectively.
The CFP members have pledged to help raise the additional seed capital for the fund. BlackRock will also provide an as yet undetermined amount.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Companies across China are handing out masks and warning staff to avoid the central Chinese city of Wuhan amid fears that the new flu-like coronavirus will rapidly spread with much of population embarking on travel for Lunar New Year holidays.
Firms from Foxconn (TW:2317) to Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and  HSBC Holdings  (L:HSBA) have issued advisories, while the government has urged members of the public to be extra careful if showing symptoms of a fever or a cold and has asked travel and other companies to accommodate people who might be affected.
The death toll rose to nine on Wednesday with 440 confirmed cases, Chinese health officials said.
At Foxconn's Lunar New Year party on Wednesday, founder Terry Gou advised Taiwan-based employees not to visit mainland China during the week-long holiday period.
""Colleagues and their families who have come back from Wuhan are all in isolation at home. The infection is spreading very fast,"" Gou added.
Company workers in Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, have been wearing facemasks and getting their temperature checked, the Apple (O:AAPL) supplier also said.
Huawei Technologies has asked staff to reduce travel to Wuhan and avoid contact with animals, adding that it had set up an outbreak prevention and control team in the city to carry out disinfecting activities, according to an internal note seen by Reuters.
 Citic  Securities (SS:600030) and investment bank China International Capital Corp (HK:3908) have asked employees to avoid trips to Wuhan and Hubei province, where the city is located, if they can, sources said, adding that if employees did travel there, they were required to report the trip.
Citic has also asked staff to voluntarily quarantine themselves if they do travel to Hubei.
Huawei and Citic Securities did not respond to requests for comment. A CICC representative declined to comment.
HSBC said it had advised employees that travel to Wuhan could continue but has asked them to be extra vigilant.
""We have stepped up cleaning measures at all our premises and all employees have been reminded to be more mindful of hygiene procedures and to stay at home or see a doctor if they feel unwell in any way,"" a spokeswoman said in an email.
Didi Chuxing, China's largest ride-hailing company, said this week it would issue masks and disinfectant to its drivers and would allow passengers and drivers in Wuhan to cancel trips for free in the days up to Jan. 31, adding that the company would bear the costs.
Travel booking platforms such as Trip.com (O:TCOM) have said users can cancel travel plans to Wuhan for free, while Shanghai's Disneyland said it will waive rescheduling fees for entry and hotel ticket buyers within six months of the purchase date given that customers might be changing their travel plans.
Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) said it will allow passengers to Wuhan to change or cancel flights without charge through Feb. 15 and permit cabin crew to wear masks on flights to the mainland.
Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) also canceled an annual event in Shenzhen at which founder Pony Ma and other top executives hand employees Lunar New Year red envelopes containing cash. A spokesman for the tech giant declined to comment if it was due to the virus."

Competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl and a shift to online shopping have put British supermarkets including  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) Plc and Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc under pressure, but Sainsbury shares have suffered the most during Coupe’s near six-year tenure.
The stock has lost about a third of its value since the CEO took the helm in July 2014, with a negative total annualized return of about 2.7% a year. That compares with a 5.9% annualized return for Morrison and a 1.3% negative return for Tesco, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Stock performance under Coupe has also trailed Sainsbury’s previous two CEOs, the data show.
The announcement of Coupe’s exit comes only nine months after the collapse of his planned acquisition of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.’s Asda, through which he aimed to gain purchasing clout and create a U.K. business to rival Tesco in scale. Even more recently, Sainsbury announced a new strategic plan involving supermarket closures and cost-cutting, as well a move to expand its line-up of convenience outlets.
“The fact that this change materializes within four months of the group outlining a new strategic plan will cause some concern,” Jefferies analyst James Grzinic wrote in a note."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets looked to be getting back to full strength on Wednesday, as updates from China about the spread of a new flu-like coronavirus raised hopes the outbreak would be contained.
Worries about contagion, particularly as millions travel for upcoming Lunar New Year festivities, have knocked the world's top equity markets off record peaks. 
The outbreak has revived memories of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002-03, a coronavirus outbreak that killed nearly 800 people.
This time, China's response and candour -- in contrast to the SARS epidemic -- have helped reassure investors concerned about the possible global fallout. 
China's National Health Commission said on Wednesday there were 440 cases of the new virus, with nine deaths so far. Measures are now in place to minimize public gatherings in the most-affected regions.
Stocks in London, Frankfurt and Paris scored early gains of 0.1% to 0.2%. S&P 500 futures (ESc1) were up 0.5% before the Wall Street open.
Shanghai stocks (SSEC) recovered from an early 1.4% drop to end higher. Japan's Nikkei (N225), South Korea's Kospi index (KS11) and Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) had all risen by more than half a percentage point overnight. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 (AXJO) shrugged off worries to hit a record high. 
Italian government bond yields rose as much as 8 basis points on reports the leader of the country's 5-Star party and foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, will step down.
It was the biggest sell-off in a month and raised the risk of another snap election in Europe's fourth-largest economy, since 5-Star is part of Italy's coalition government.
""The initial reaction was to sell because of the heightened political uncertainty,"" said Luca Cazzulani, a strategist at UniCredit in Milan. ""But there is no outright link between de Maio's resignation and a collapse of the government.""
With markets generally rising, safe plays such as gold and the Japanese yen were weaker. The dollar (DXY) was rising toward the highs it reached in December against the other top world currencies. [/FRX] 
The coronavirus outbreak has spread from its origin in Wuhan, China, to the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. The World Health Organization meets later on Wednesday to consider whether the outbreak is an international emergency.
""The call here is not that the virus is done or nipped in the bud by any means,"" said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. ""But there have been no big further reported outbreaks, and the response from the Chinese authorities has been very, very positive"". 
SARS FLASHBACK
Airlines, other travel-exposed stocks and retailers vulnerable to shifts in consumer sentiment have borne the brunt of selling in the past two days, along with the Chinese yuan. 
MSCI's airline industry index <.dMIWO0AL00P> posted its biggest daily drop in more than three months on Tuesday. Airline shares were still falling on Wednesday. 
""While details on the coronavirus are scant, we reckon that the SARS period could offer some clues as to how markets could pan out,"" analysts at Singapore's DBS Bank said. ""The trends are clear: Yields and stock prices fell in the first few months of the SARS outbreak and rebounded thereafter."" 
So far, the yield on U.S. 10-year government bonds has stabilized after Tuesday's drop, sitting at 1.78% (US10YT=RR) in European trading. [US/]
Spot gold  gave back some gains to trade at $1,555 per ounce and the yuan eased in the onshore market  to 6.8997 per dollar. 
Oil prices also settled back as traders figured a well-supplied global market would be able to absorb disruptions that have cut Libya's crude production. [O/R]

Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 0.31% at $64.39 a barrel and U.S. crude (CLc1) fell 0.43% to $58.13 a barrel.

7,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 05:19AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Dieselgate Returns to Haunt Daimler, Again","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The Diesel scandal refuses to relax its hold on Germany’s big carmakers.
Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz, issued a third profit warning for 2019 as it unveiled preliminary results for the year on Wednesday, saying that litigation costs related to Dieselgate could be anywhere between 1.1 billion and 1.5 billion euros ($1.2 to $1.65 billion).
The news is further evidence of the German car sector’s troubles in moving beyond a disastrous bet on a technology that it boasted would help solve Europe’s greenhouse gas problems, but which only succeeded in massively increasing pollution, with untold negative effects on public health across the continent. Having led the world in engine technology for decades, Daimler and its rivals are now having to spend heavily to catch up in new, low-carbon alternatives.
Overall earnings before interest and taxes, Daimler’s preferred measure, fell by nearly half at the core car division to 3.7 billion euros. But while that was bad, problems have been far worse at the vans unit, which has suffered from the collapse in business confidence over the last 18 months.
Even without the new provisions, the division is expected to have lost 2.4 billion euros last year, after just breaking even in 2018. The existing forecast of a -15% to -17% return on sales, which includes a previously-announced 300 million euro restructuring charge, is now deemed too optimistic.
The Stuttgart-based company has also had to take a 300 million-euro charge against its YOUR NOW mobility unit, after ride-sharing ventures failed to grow as expected.
The company’s problems are still those that many others would like to have: it posted a ninth straight year of record sales in 2019, testimony to the global public’s enduring preference for powerful engines over environmental performance. That, combined with its historically strong margins, explains why it still commands a valuation of 13 times trailing earnings, while BMWG (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) limp along at under 10.
But Daimler stock is still down 35% over the last three years and shows little sign of a convincing rebound, given the uncertain but inevitably huge investment burden it will have to carry for the next few years. 
Nor is there any end in sight to the uncertainty regarding the important U.S. market. President Donald Trump in an interview with CNBC revived the threat of tariffs against EU products (autos have always figured at the top of the list, given the EU’s huge sectoral surplus with the U.S.), if the EU doesn’t agree to a new “deal”. He didn’t specify what that would entail.
The interview was enough to nix initial gains in Europe’s broader markets on Wednesday. By 5:13 AM ET (1013 GMT), the German DAX was up only 0.1%, having earlier hit an all-time high of 13,637.60, its first in nearly two years. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was likewise up 0.1%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.2%.
Elsewhere, Airbus (PA:AIR) hit a new all-time high after reports that Boeing (NYSE:BA) had yet again pushed back its timeline for delivering its promised 737 MAX aircraft."

Investing.com - European stock markets came off highs Wednesday, as comments from U.S. President Donald Trump reminded traders of the risk of a new trade conflict with the EU, overshadowing the easing of fears about the spread of a new virus in China. 
At 05:00 ET (1000 GMT), the DAX traded 17 points, or 0.1% higher, after initially surging to a new record high intraday. France's CAC 40 was flat, while the FTSE 100 in the U.K. gained 10 points, or 0.1%. The pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50 dropped 3 points, or 0.1%.
In an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump reiterated the need to use tariffs in trade negotiations. This stance raises doubts a second-phase deal with China will be signed before Trump’s term ends in a year.
Earlier Wednesday, China’s public health officials confirmed more than 400 cases of the coronavirus illness, with the death toll rising to nine, but authorities in Beijing said the country will start a nationwide screening effort to tackle the outbreak.
In corporate news, Britain's Berkeley Group (LON:BKGH) jumped 6% to the top of STOXX 600 index as the housebuilder said it will increase its returns to shareholders by about 455 million pounds ($594 million) over the next two years.
Shares in   Burberry   (LON:BRBY) dropped 2% despite raising its guidance for the year after the luxury brand saw sales being hit by the disruptions in the key Hong Kong market.
Elsewhere, the price of oil has retreated after the International Energy Agency reiterated its forecast for a market surplus in the first half of the year.
""I see an abundance of energy supply in terms of oil and gas,"" head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, while he was attending World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

 Burberry  Group (LON:BRBY) Plc became the latest victim of the Hong Kong protests as sales in that market dropped in half over the Christmas quarter, while growing concern about the spread of a new viral disease in Asia risks dimming the outlook further.
The stock fell as much as 2.9% as investors looked past a higher forecast for full-year sales. Retail sales growth came in just ahead of the consensus for the company’s fiscal third quarter, which ran through December, but the stock has been strong recently, gaining 27% in 2019.
The luxury industry is bracing for the impact of the growing outbreak of a new lung ailment that broke out in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization is set to decide Wednesday whether to declare the virus an international public health emergency, just before millions of people prepare to travel for the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.
Revenue in Hong Kong slumped as the protests led to a drop in Chinese tourists. Sales on the mainland rose more than 10%. Burberry’s growth is still lagging peers nearly two years after the head designer, Riccardo Tisci, was hired and about three years since Chief Executive Officer Marco Gobbetti joined. Both came from top luxury rival LVMH.
A retooled aesthetic with new products, logos, and store decor is fueling interest in the British maker of $2,000 trenchcoats and $470 scarves. New products made up three-quarters of the assortment. But with stores as far-flung as a boutique in Paris’s posh 8th district and an outlet mall in Dawsonville, Georgia, the transition to a new Burberry is taking time.
“Brand heat is improving but we are unsure that it is strong enough to take market share from the sector winners,” wrote Piral Dadhania, an analyst at RBC. The company previously forecast flat sales this year."

Daimler said that its 2019 earnings before interest and tax are expected to slump to 5.6 billion euros ($6.2 billion) from 11.1 billion euros a year earlier. 
Following its preliminary assessment, 2019 expenses for ongoing governmental and court proceedings relating to diesel vehicles amount to 1.1-1.5 billion euros, impacting its core Mercedes-Benz Cars unit -- costs which are not yet included in the preliminary figure. 
Daimler shares initially fell, then turned positive and were back down 0.1% at 0845 GMT.
The carmaker said that it expects return on sales at Mercedes-Benz Cars to slump to 4% in 2019, compared to 7.8% in 2018, while it would decrease to minus 15.9% from plus 2.3% at its vans unit and to 6.1% from 7.2% at its trucks unit.
One-off costs of 300 million for a review of its vans product portfolio as well as of another 300 million for the realignment of Daimler's Your Now mobility services are included in the preliminary figure, it added.
New Daimler Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius is set to announce full-year earnings on February 11.
The weak earnings contrast with Daimler's car sales. It sold 2.34 million Mercedes-Benz passenger cars in 2019 for a ninth consecutive year of record sales, putting the German carmaker in pole position to retain the title of biggest-selling premium car brand.

The carmaker had flagged an expected slump in 2019 earnings in October and at the time said that legal proceedings tied to diesel emissions may result in additional expenditures.

Financial details were not disclosed.
Through a joint working group, the two companies will determine what opportunities may exist in developing, producing and marketing vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) products including Tactical Robotics' own Cormorant autonomous vehicle.
Due to its compact, Humvee-sized footprint, Cormorant can conduct emergency response missions such as delivering food, water and supplies during natural disasters or in combat environments, Boeing said. It can also carry up to four patients for medical evacuations.
Aviation ducted fan technology uses a fan mounted in a cylindrical duct to produce thrust. This arrangement can enhance airflow velocity and pressure when compared to an open rotor."

At 03:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the benchmark index traded 0.5% higher at 13,627.38, just off the new high of 13,637.60. This breached the record close that was put in place in January 2018. 
The German economy is one of the most open in the world and its companies are thus very exposed to global trade issues. The lessening of concern over the virus in Asia, along with the recent improvement in U.S.-China relations resulting in this month's trade deal, have put a spring back into their step.

Investing.com -- Here is a summary of the most important regulatory news releases ahead of the U.K. market open on Wednesday 22nd January. Please refresh for updates for U.K. market news from the LSE’s RNS on individual UK shares from FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and FTSE All-Share 350.
Housebuilder Berkeley Group (LON:BKGH) said it will raise its planned return to shareholders by 455 million pounds ($594 million) over the next two years. It plans to return to the current schedule of annual returns of 280 million pounds thereafter, saying it needed the cash to finance long-term regeneration projects.
The move comes after three years of cautious cash hoarding in the wake of the U.K. vote to leave the EU. The company’s net cash position has risen from 108 million pounds to over a billion pounds in that time.
  Burberry   (LON:BRBY) raised its sales forecast for the full year after “strong growth” from new collections pushed like-for-like sales up 3% in the three months through December.
Having previously expected flat sales for the year through March, it now expects a “low single-digit percentage” increase, adjusted for foreign exchange swings. It expects its operating margin to remain stable.
The maker of check-patterned trench coats depended largely on China for the improvement, where sales rose by some 15%. However, sales in Hong Kong halved due to the impact of months of protests.
More worrying was the group’s failure to capitalize on a strong U.S. economy. Revenue in the Americas was flat on the year.
Supermarket chain J   Sainsbury   (OTC:JSAIY) (LON:SBRY) is getting a new chief executive, less than a year after regulators quashed its ambitious deal to merge with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) unit Asda. The company said Mike Coupe will retire at the end of May.
Sainsbury’s is appointing another company insider to the top job in the form of Retail and Operations Director Simon Roberts.
Accounting software provider   Sage Group   (LON:SGE) upheld its guidance for the 2020 fiscal year after a promising start in the three months through December.
Recurring revenue rose 11% to 410 million pounds as the company signed up more customers for its cloud-based subscription service.

15,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 02:43AM ET</span>",Ghosn's right-hand man stands high chance of acquittal in Japan: ex-prosecutor,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A lieutenant to Carlos Ghosn who is facing charges in Japan for underreporting his salary at Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) stands a very high chance of being acquitted, as would Ghosn had he remained in Japan to face trial, a former prosecutor said.
Lawyer Nobuo Gohara, a vocal critic of what he describes as Japan's ""hostage"" justice system, met Ghosn in Japan on a number of occasions late last year before the former Nissan chairman's dramatic escape to Lebanon last month.
Ghosn, whose escape to his childhood homeland breached his strict bail terms, has criticized the Japanese justice system and vowed to clear his name following the downfall one of the world's most powerful automobile industry executives.
Both Ghosn and former Nissan director Greg Kelly face charges of financial misconduct over allegedly failing to report more than $109 million in salary, while Ghosn has also been charged with aggravated breach of trust for using company funds for personal purposes.
Both deny wrongdoing. Kelly remains in Japan awaiting trial.
It was not obvious that the additional salary due to Ghosn after retirement constituted a crime under Japanese law as it had yet to be paid out, said Gohara, who does not represent Ghosn or Kelly, who is accused of arranging the payments.
""Personally I believe that there was a very high chance for Mr Ghosn to be acquitted based on the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act,"" he told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday.
""Likewise for Mr Kelly, there is a high likelihood that he will be acquitted as well.""
The trial of the two men and Nissan, which is also facing the same charge, is due to begin in 2021 or 2022. It was unclear whether the schedule would be updated after Ghosn's escape.
Japan's Ministry of Justice has said it will try to find a way to bring Ghosn back from Lebanon, even though the two countries do not have an extradition treaty.
Gohara said a separate trial over aggravated breach of trust would likely drag on for years as prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to prove Ghosn was guilty of crimes including temporarily shifting a personal loss-making currency transaction onto Nissan's books.
The lawyer said he had conducted about 10 hours of interviews with Ghosn in November and December for a book he had written about the case. The project has since been placed on hold, for reasons Gohara said were unrelated to his subject's escape."

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Wednesday, helped by a stronger tone out of Asia, as traders took a calmer approach to news of the emergence of a new virus in China - one which has now reached the U.S. and several other countries.
At 02:10 ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 84 points, or 0.6% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 38 points, or 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 32 points, or 0.4%. Futures on the pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50, climbed 20 points, or 0.5%.
Earlier Wednesday, China’s public health officials confirmed more than 400 cases of coronavirus, with the death toll rising to nine, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the first case of the illness in the United States. Additionally, authorities in Beijing said the country would start a nationwide screening effort to tackle the outbreak.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1.2% after closing down almost 3% yesterday, Japan’s Nikkei 225 advanced 0.6% and Shanghai blue chips 0.3%.
This new virus brings back memories, for those old enough, of the SARS pandemic in 2002. On that occasion more than 8,000 people across 37 countries were affected, with close to 800 deaths.
“What scared people about SARS is the mortality rate,” said Robert Carnell, Chief Economist Head of Research Asia-Pacific at ING, in a research note. But, “put into context, your chances of contracting and dying of SARS, were statistically far less than of dying of regular flu. But the response of the population of countries where there was a perceived greater risk, was huge. Presumably, the reasoning was, if I do get it, the odds aren't great.”
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 151.25 points, or 0.5%, to 29,196.85, the S&P 500 lost 8.75 points, or 0.3%, to 3,320.87 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.14 points, or 0.2%, to 9,370.81, as traders caught up with the news following the public holiday on Monday.
The World Economic Forum continues in Davos, Switzerland, Wednesday, although there will likely be less focus on the event after the star turn, U.S. President Donald Trump, spoke Tuesday.
In corporate news, car manufacturers are set to be in focus after overnight news from Japan that Toyota (T:7203) will recall 3.4 million vehicles worldwide for a defect that could impact air bags and seat belts.

Elsewhere, the price of oil has retreated after the IEA forecast a market surplus in the first half of the year, despite the prospect of a near-total shutdown of production in OPEC member Libya.
""I see an abundance of energy supply in terms of oil and gas,"" head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, while he was attending World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 12:10AM ET</span>",Airlines scour the world for scarce 737 MAX simulators,"By Allison Lampert, Jamie Freed and David Shepardson
MONTREAL/SYDNEY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Airlines are scrambling to book time in 737 MAX training facilities as far afield as Fiji, Iceland and Panama, operators said, after Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co recommended pilots be trained in one of the few simulators replicating the latest model.
That means thousands of pilots from more than 54 airlines need to squeeze into about three dozen 737 MAX simulators around the world before they can fly the plane. 
""Boeing is recommending that all 737 MAX pilots undergo training in a 737 MAX simulator prior to flying the aircraft in commercial service,"" the company told Reuters on Tuesday evening, the first confirmation of its new policy. 
On Jan. 7, the company had recommended using a simulator but did not specify what type.
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes and cannot return to service until regulators approve software changes and training plans.
The estimated 34 737 MAX simulators in service, produced separately by CAE Inc and Textron (NYSE:TXT) Inc's simulator and training division TRU, are less than a quarter of the number of older 737 NG simulators certified by U.S. and European regulators.
""I think that what a shortage of simulators will mean is the fleet of MAXes will start flying more slowly than what the airlines would like,"" said Gudmundur Orn Gunnarsson, managing director of TRU Flight Training Iceland, a joint venture between Icelandair and Textron's simulator and training division.
""In the beginning it was said that simulator training would not be needed,"" he said. ""This changes it totally.""
SIMULATORS SCARCE
Gunnarsson said TRU Flight Training Iceland had more inquiries than usual from potential airline customers about the use of its 737 MAX simulator since Boeing's Jan. 7 announcement. 
Boeing said on Tuesday it did not expect to win approval for returning the 737 MAX to service until mid-year, longer than previous estimates, in part because regulators are working on new pilot training requirements.
Many airlines did not order 737 MAX simulators, assuming they could rely on the older 737 NG simulators because the types were so similar.
Simulators can cost C$10 million ($7.64 million) to C$20 million each, with the 737 MAX at the upper end, CAE said. Hourly rates for simulator training can cost $500 to $1,000, it said. 
High demand for 737 MAX simulators has led the Montreal-company and its rival TRU to produce simulators for customers they have yet to line up.
""Customers are making increasing inquiries from all over the globe,"" a TRU spokeswoman said.
South Korean low-cost carrier Eastar Jet, which does not have a 737 MAX simulator, said it had already contacted Boeing, other airlines and training centers.
""With limited MAX simulators available, we expect carriers will likely face challenges to book slots for MAX simulators,"" said an Eastar official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.
SELLING TIME
Fiji Airways spent more than $10 million to buy a 737 MAX simulator to help save on the costs and lost productivity of sending pilots to Singapore, Australia and the United States for training, said its chief operating officer, Paul Doherty.
The carrier uses its simulator 35% to 42% of the available hours to train its 70 737 pilots and had plans to sell the additional time. Now it is getting calls from airlines thousands of miles away. 
""We have got interest ... particularly from Asia,"" Doherty said. ""We are expecting some from the U.S. Our focus is to really develop our own pilots and to provide the best for Fiji Airways, but we are also very happy to help other airlines that need some time. That could be a real choke point, I think, for a lot of airlines.""
Panamanian carrier Copa Holdings SA, the only Latin American airline with a 737 MAX simulator, said it was seeing a lot of demand, although it was not authorized to disclose the interested carriers. Copa said it its top priority was to train its own 245 pilots.
U.S. airlines have more simulators than many of their counterparts abroad, but they also have more 737 pilots to train, which could be done in stages. 
Before Boeing's recommendations for simulator training, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, the world's largest 737 operator, had estimated it would take about 30 days to train all of its roughly 10,000 737 pilots on the MAX.
On Tuesday, the Dallas-based carrier said it would be premature to make cost and timing estimates before regulators approved a training package.

The airline said it has three simulators in various stages of FAA certification and expects to receive an additional three in late 2020.

The recall covers certain versions of the 2011-2019 Corolla, 2011-2013 Matrix, 2012-2018 Avalon and 2013-2018 Avalon Hybrid, Toyota said on its company website. 
 
The automaker said one of the electronic control components does not have adequate protection against electrical noise in certain crashes. 
 
The company added that most dealer will install a noise filter at no cost to fix the issue.
 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been looking into the issue with several automakers, including Toyota, since April of last year.
 
Hyundai, Kia and Fiat Chrysler previously issued recalls for more than 2.5 million vehicles with the TRW air bag control units in question that might not deploy in crashes.

26,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 10:56PM ET</span>","Toyota to recall 3.4 million vehicles worldwide, air bags may not deploy in crashes","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it will recall 3.4 million vehicles worldwide because of an electronic defect that can result in air bags not deploying in crashes.
The recall, which includes 2.9 million U.S. vehicles, covers 2011-2019 Corolla, 2011-2013 Matrix, 2012-2018 Avalon and 2013-2018 Avalon Hybrid vehicles and is tied to a report of one fatal crash.
The vehicles may have an electronic control unit that does not have adequate protection against electrical noise that can occur in crashes, which could lead to incomplete or non-deployment of the air bags. It could also impede the operation of seat-belt pretensioners.
In April, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) expanded a probe into 12.3 million potentially defective air bags covering a number of automakers, including the vehicles Toyota is recalling.
NHTSA said in April it had identified two frontal crash events, including one fatal crash ""involving Toyota products where (electrical overstress) is suspected as the likely cause"" of air bags not deploying. Both involved newer Corolla cars.
NHTSA said the air bags under investigation were installed in more than 12 million vehicles from 2010 through 2019 sold by Toyota, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co, Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and Mitsubishi.
They were equipped with an air bag control unit initially produced by TRW Automotive Holdings Corp, which is now owned by ZF Friedrichshafen.
In total, NHTSA said as many as eight deaths could be tied to the issue.
Hyundai, Kia and Fiat Chrysler previously issued recalls for more than 2.5 million vehicles with the TRW air bag control units in question that might not deploy in crashes.
When it recalled nearly 2 million vehicles for air bag non-deployments in 2016, Fiat Chrysler said it had reports of three deaths and five injuries that might be related to the defect.
Hyundai and Kia ultimately recalled more than 1 million vehicles for air bag non-deployment concerns in 2018. Hyundai and Kia in 2018 said they had reports of four deaths and six injuries in North America tied to the issue.
Toyota dealers will install a noise filter between the air bag control module and its wire harness if needed.

Toyota declined to say how many deaths or injuries have been tied to the defect. Toyota will notify vehicle owners of the recall by mid-March.

27,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 10:53PM ET</span>","Boeing warns of new 737 MAX delay, now sees mid-year return to service","By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday it does not expect to win approval for the return of the 737 MAX to service until mid-year due to further potential developments in the certification process and regulatory scrutiny on its flight control system.
Boeing said it has informed airlines and suppliers of the new estimate, which is longer than previous forecasts and also takes into account new anticipated pilot training requirements.
Reuters reported last week that regulators had been pushing back the time needed to approve the plane, which was most recently expected to happen in February or March, a year after the jetliner was grounded worldwide.
Based on regulatory approval in the first quarter, the three U.S. airlines that operate the 737 MAX - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, United Airlines Holdings Inc and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co - were scheduling MAX flights in early June. They will now likely have to extend the timeline again. They have said it could take at least 30 days to resume flights following U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approval because of the time needed to ready the planes and train pilots. 
The Chicago-based planemaker has been updating the 737 MAX flight control system and software to address issues believed to have played a role in two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people within five months.
Boeing shares closed 3.3% lower at $313.37 after falling as much as 5.7% during the session.
""Returning the MAX safely to service is our number one priority, and we are confident that will happen,"" Boeing said in a statement. ""We acknowledge and regret the continued difficulties that the grounding of the 737 MAX has presented to our customers, our regulators, our suppliers, and the flying public."" 
Boeing said it will provide additional information with quarterly results next week.
The FAA said in a statement on Tuesday that it is following a ""thorough, deliberate process to verify that all proposed modifications to the Boeing 737 MAX meet the highest certification standards.""
The agency is working with other safety regulators to review Boeing's work and reiterated it has set no time frame for when the review will be completed.
Reuters reported on Monday that Boeing is in talks with banks about borrowing $10 billion or more amid rising costs after the two crashes involving the 737 MAX.
Boeing in recent days temporarily halted production of the 737 MAX in Washington state, a move it announced in December as it became clear that regulatory approval was taking longer than it had forecast.
Boeing has estimated the costs of the 737 MAX grounding at more than $9 billion to date, and is expected to disclose significant additional costs during its fourth-quarter earnings release on Jan. 29.
The company faces rising costs from halting production of the plane this month, compensating airlines for lost flights and assisting its supply chain.

Following Boeing’s announcement, Canada's WestJet Airlines said it would remove the 737 MAX from its schedule through June 24. Air Canada declined comment.

28,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 10:15PM ET</span>",Netflix forecasts tough start to 2020; Disney+ going global,"By Helen Coster and Neha Malara
(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) has entered a new year that will be far tougher than the one it left behind.
International growth helped the streaming video service trounce expectations in the last quarter of 2019.
But the company acknowledged competition had an impact in the United States, where growth missed Wall Street targets - and that competition will become more global as the Disney+ service launches across Europe in March.
Rivals including Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are now fighting for streaming customers, and Netflix said it expects to add 7 million subscribers globally in the first quarter, below analysts' average of 8.82 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
For a company that has historically taken great pains to avoid mentioning competitive forces - it once called the video game Fortnite a bigger rival than other streaming services - it spent a considerable amount of time explaining why Disney's power will not have as damaging an effect on its engine of growth outside of America.
""Despite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per membership grew both globally and in the U.S. on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters,"" the company wrote in a letter to investors. 
Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings described the fourth quarter's 8.76 million net subscriber growth - boosted by a new season of royal drama ""The Crown"" and two films nominated for Best Picture Oscars - as ""just amazing.""
That number beat Wall Street estimates for the fourth quarter, helping to send shares up 2.2% in volatile after-hours trading on Tuesday.
COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
The Disney+ and Apple TV+ streaming services both launched in the United States in November. Disney+, which is also live in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, will launch in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Austria and Switzerland on March 24. Apple TV+ is available in over 100 countries and regions.
The Disney+ service launched in the United States and Canada for $7 per month and $13 a month for a bundle with ESPN+ and Hulu; it reached 10 million sign-ups on its first day. Apple TV+ launched Nov. 1 for $5 per month and is free for one year with the purchase of some Apple devices: its performance has been harder to define. AT&T-owner WarnerMedia's HBO Max will cost $15 per month when it launches in May.
Netflix is available in over 190 countries; its standard U.S. plan costs $13 per month.
Netflix has had an outsized impact on the pay TV landscape, changing the way that people consume TV and film and forcing media and tech companies to shift their business models. As streaming video has grown in the United States, the market has become more competitive, pushing Netflix to look overseas for growth.
As such, the company has invested heavily in non-English language content, and this quarter began releasing revenue and subscriber numbers by region for the first time. It added 1.75 million subscribers in Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, while Latin America grew by 2.04 million subscribers in the quarter. 
As rivals have pulled their content off of Netflix, the company has poured money into original TV series and films. It had a $15 billion cash budget for content last year and $14.76 billion in long-term debt as of Dec. 31, 2019. 
""Friends"" left Netflix in the United States this month and will run on HBO Max. ""The Office"" is leaving the service at the end of 2020 and will be available on Comcast-owned NBCUniversals forthcoming Peacock streaming platform next year. 
""The streaming service's massive content and marketing budget can only be justified if the company is adding more subscribers at a robust rate. If that doesn't materialize, then its stock price will reflect that reality,"" wrote Haris Anwar, an analyst at investing.com.
The addition of new streaming platforms - taking more out of a household's monthly entertainment budget - has also made it harder for Netflix to raise prices, as it did in the United States last year.
Free, advertising-supported services such as Peacock and ViacomCBS-owned Pluto TV may also limit Netflix's pricing power, according to research from  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). 
Net income rose to $587 million, or $1.30 per share, in the fourth quarter from $134 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue rose to $5.5 billion from $4.2 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $5.45 billion. 

The streaming giant said it added 8.76 million paid subscribers globally compared with expectations of 7.63 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 10:07PM ET</span>",Tesla crosses $100 billion stock market valuation in extended trading,"(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc became the first $100 billion publicly listed U.S. carmaker in extended trading on Tuesday, in a sign of Wall Street's confidence in an all-electric future.
The milestone comes less than a month after Tesla's stock crossed $420, the infamous price at which Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had tweeted he would take the electric car maker private.
Musk tweeted he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private in August 2018, when its shares were trading in the mid-$330s, only to later give up under investor pressure and regulatory concerns.
Tesla shares were last up 1.4% at $555 after the bell, building on a 7.2% gain during trading when brokerage New Street Research raised its price target to $800.
Tesla's market value also puts Musk a step closer to earning the first $346 million tranche of options in a record-breaking pay package.
The $100 billion valuation needs to stay for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock.
Tesla, which is already valued more than Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) combined, has seen its stock more than double in the last three months, fueled by a rare quarterly profit in October, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and better-than-expected annual car deliveries.
In another win, Tesla reached a settlement with Michigan to allow it to directly deliver its vehicles to customers in the state, a person familiar with the agreement said on Tuesday."

A federal judge in San Francisco dismissed a 2018 lawsuit brought against Uber by defunct startup Sidecar Technologies Inc, which pioneered on-demand ride-hailing. The judge gave Sidecar an opportunity to replead its claims brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act, saying ""if Sidecar believes that it can cure the defects in its Sherman Act claims, it may file a second amended complaint no later than Feb. 4, 2020.""
The lawsuit claimed ""Uber became hell-bent on stifling competition from competing ride-hailing apps,"" and used subsidies and made fake ride requests to competitors in a bid to dominate the market.
Sidecar went out of business in December 2015 and sold its assets to General Motors Co (N:GM) in 2016."

The Asia-Pacific region was the worst-hit in the 2010-2019 period, accounting for 44% of the total, with earthquakes, tsunamis and tropical cyclones among the disasters, Aon said in a report.
More intense weather events, bigger populations in the path of disasters and greater supply chain disruption in a globalized economy contributed to the sharp rise in economic damage, Aon said.
""Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the last decade of natural disasters was the emergence of previously considered 'secondary' perils – such as wildfire, flood, and drought – becoming much more costly,"" said Steve Bowen, director and meteorologist at Aon’s impact forecasting team.
""Scientific research indicates that climate change will continue to affect all types of weather phenomena and subsequently impact increasingly urbanized areas.""
Last year was the second warmest year on record for land and ocean temperatures, though Aon said economic and insured losses were lower than in the previous two years.
There were 409 natural catastrophe events totaling $232 billion in losses in 2019, with $71 billion covered by insurance programs, the report said.
The Aon 2019 estimates topped those by global reinsurer Munich Re (DE:MUVGn), which said last week overall natural catastrophe losses were $150 billion, and insured losses $52 billion."

Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. J&J Weighs in With Results
Dow component Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will report earnings ahead of trading tomorrow.
On average, analysts are predicting quarterly earnings of $1.87 per share on revenue of about $20.8 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
But with all the litigation the pharma company is facing “even a robust quarter is unlikely to produce a sustainable rally in J&J (NYSE:JNJ) stock, which has substantially trailed the broader market this year,” Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.
  Barclays   (LON:BARC) upgraded J&J stock last month to overweight from equal weight with an increased price target of $173 per share.
The analyst noted that fundamentals are positive and that the consensus outlook was achievable.
2. Existing Home Sales Seen Rising
Housing data headlines the economic calendar tomorrow with the latest figures on prices and existing home sales.
The National Association of Realtors reports on December sales of existing homes at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
Sales are expected to come in at an annual rate of 5.43 million for last month, up from 5.35 million in November, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Before that, at 9:00 AM ET, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight reports on November house prices.
Its house price index is forecast to have risen 0.2% for the month.
3. Market Will Continue Watching Health Scare
Along with the numbers, investors would do well to keep an eye out for any news on the Wuhan coronavirus.
Wall Street looked to be shaking off concerns in early trading, despite weakness in sectors like airlines and gaming. But the report of the first confirmed case of the disease in the U.S. sent shares into the red right away, resulting in a down day for the major indexes.
A man who traveled back from Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, to Washington state was confirmed to have the infection Monday afternoon after being hospitalized last week.
The disease is believed to be spread from person to person and could hurt both U.S. and Chinese economies.
But the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector, the companies most likely struggle if an outbreak were to happen, ended the day down just 0.17%.
Also outside of the earnings and economic calendars, there will be another day of headlines from the World Economic Forum in Davos. Trade is likely in focus again, although neither President Donald Trump’s speech nor his meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen generated much market movement."
35,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 05:46PM ET</span>",United beats Wall Street expectations despite ongoing 737 MAX delays,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) on Tuesday beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and held to its 2020 profit target, with a turnaround strategy overseen by its outgoing CEO underpinning growth even as the Boeing 737 MAX remains grounded. 
Chicago-based United is one of three U.S. airlines cancelling more than 1,000 monthly flights in a hit to profits as the 737 MAX remains grounded following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Tuesday it does not expect approval for the 737 MAX's return to service until mid-year, later than previously forecast. 
While United has warned of a hit from the MAX grounding, it did not disclose any estimated financial impact from the fallout and stood by its full-year adjusted EPS range of $11 to $13.
Total operating revenue rose 3.8% to $10.89 billion, boosted by strong travel demand and Chief Executive Oscar Munoz's three-year strategy to build up the airline's flight connections through its main U.S. hubs. United President Scott Kirby will succeed Munoz as CEO later this year. 
Revenue per mile flown, a closely watched industry measurement, rose 0.8% in the fourth quarter and United forecast similar growth in the first quarter given solid bookings. 
However, unit costs excluding fuel and profit-sharing expenses, a concern for investors in a year of contract negotiations with pilots, rose 2.7%.
United had already announced a non-cash impairment charge of $90 million in the fourth quarter related to its Hong Kong routes, following anti-government protests in the city.
Shares of United closed 4.4% lower at $85.79 before the earnings release, tracking sharp declines for U.S. airline and travel stocks on concerns over the Wuhan coronavirus in China, which J.P.Morgan analyst Jamie Baker said poses a near-term overhang for airlines.
United did not comment on the outbreak in its results but separately said there is no impact on its operations and it remains in close contact with U.S., Chinese and other Asian authorities on safety.
United management will host a conference call to discuss results on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EST (1630 GMT).
Adjusted net income rose to $676 million, or $2.67 per share, in the fourth quarter to Dec. 31, from $657 million a year earlier, topping a Wall Street consensus forecast for $2.65 per share.
Fellow U.S. MAX operators Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) are due to report quarterly results on Thursday.
The three airlines are scheduling without the MAX until early June though that timeline will likely need to be pushed back following Tuesday's guidance from Boeing.
United, which had 14 737 MAX jets in its fleet at the time of the grounding, said it plans to take delivery of 28 MAX variants in 2020 depending on U.S. regulatory approval and Boeing's subsequent pace of production and deliveries. 

Among other aircraft orders, it expects to take delivery of two Boeing 777-300s and 15 Boeing 787s in 2020 but has decided to assign its purchase obligations for 20 Embraer 175s to one of its regional partners once each jet is delivered.

Over the past few years, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has been trying to shift the company's focus to the cloud through acquisitions and also by selling some of IBM's legacy businesses.
 IBM  bought Linux maker Red Hat Inc (NYSE:RHT) in a $34 billion deal last year, its biggest acquisition so far, in a push to expand its subscription-based software business.
Revenue from the cloud business rose 21% to $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter, its largest so far.
The company forecast an adjusted profit of at least $13.35 per share for the year, compared with estimate of $13.29.
IBM reported adjusted gross profit margin of nearly 52% for the quarter, a rise of 230 basis points, which was its largest in more than 10 years.
The company had changed its reporting structure last year – its two biggest segments now are cloud and cognitive software, and global technology services.
Revenue from the cloud and cognitive software segment, which includes Red Hat, rose 8.7% to $7.2 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.
IBM has said that it would report only a portion of Red Hat's actual revenue for some quarters, while recording all its expenses as required by U.S. accounting standards.
The global technology services segment, which caters to some of the world's largest data centers, reported $6.9 billion of revenue, down 4.8% from the previous year.
IBM recorded a marginal increase of 0.1% in overall revenue to $21.78 billion in the quarter, its first rise in six quarters. Analysts on average had expected a drop of nearly 1%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Rometty said IBM is positioned for sustained revenue growth in 2020.

Excluding special items, it earned $4.71 per share, above analysts' expectation of $4.69.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co (T:7267) said on Tuesday it will recall 2.7 million older U.S. vehicles in North America for potentially defective air bag inflators.
The defect involves a different type of Takata inflator than those that have prompted the largest-ever auto safety recalls worldwide covering more than 42 million U.S. vehicles by 19 automakers with Takata air bag inflators. 
The new recall covers Honda and Acura automobiles from the 1996 through 2003 model years. Honda said it is aware of one field rupture of a inflator in the new recall campaign - a 2012 crash in Texas that resulted in an injury - and two in junkyards in Japan.
The campaign covers 2.4 million U.S. vehicles and 300,000 in Canada, Honda said, adding that it has not determined recall numbers for other countries.
Takata issued a new defect notice in November for inflators from four automakers, including Honda.
Honda said all three vehicles ""potentially were exposed to unusually high amounts of moisture prior to the rupture events.""
Honda said the recalls cover driver front airbag inflators manufactured with non-azide propellant and said ""all inspections and repairs will begin in approximately one year, as replacement parts from alternative suppliers are not yet available.""

Honda said it ""regrets any inconvenience or distress that this situation may cause to our customers as we seek to resolve this situation. Honda believes that the risk of improper airbag deployment in its vehicles remains very low at this time, but we cannot absolutely guarantee the performance of any recalled part.""

Investing.com - Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) delivered a quarterly earnings beat, but its weaker outlook on subscriber additions intensified fears that rising competition would rein in growth.
Following the launch of streaming services from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) last year, Netflix said it expected to add 7 million net subscribers in the first quarter, well below Wall Street expectations of 8.5 million. That is also below the 9.6 million subscribers added in the first quarter last year. 
Netflix blamed weaker guidance on higher churn levels in the U.S.
""Our Q1’20 forecast reflects the continued, slightly elevated churn levels we are seeing in the U.S. plus an expectation for more balanced paid net adds across Q1 and Q2 this year, with seasonality more similar to 2018 than 2019,"" Netflix said. ""This is due in part to the timing of last year’s price changes and a strong upcoming Q2 content slate, where we’ll have some of our bigger titles like La Casa De Papel (aka Money Heist) season 4.""
The streaming giant reported 550,000 U.S. and Canada streaming additions, missing forecasts of 611,000, but fared better internationally adding 8.33 million subscribers during the quarter, well above the 7.2 million expected.
 

Netflix announced earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30 on revenue of $5.47 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $0.52 on revenue of $5.45 billion. That was in comparison with EPS of $0.30 on revenue of $4.19 billion in the same quarter a year before. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) had announced EPS of $1.47 on revenue of $5.24 billion in the previous quarter.
Analysts are forecasting EPS of $1.21 and revenue of $5.76 billion in the next quarter. Netflix said it expects to report first-quarter revenue of $5.73 billion and earnings per share of $1.66. 
“The biggest challenge for Netflix in this dynamic situation is how to maintain a fine balance between growth and spending,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. ""The company’s huge content and marketing budget can only be justified if the company is adding more subscribers. If that doesn’t materialize, then its stock has to reflect that reality, especially when Netflix is borrowing to fuel growth,” 
“In our view, Netflix will continue to lag behind other mega tech stocks until investors are able to see a clear sign that the company is holding up well and can defend its turf. Strong subscription growth in 2020 is crucial to achieving that outcome.""

Netflix shares are up 4.58% since the start of the year and are trading at $338.40, still down 12.33% from its 52-week high of $385.99 set on May 1, 2019.

The S&P 500 lost 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.19% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.52%.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the first case of the coronavirus in the United States.
The news was met with a wave of selling in airline and casino stocks on fears that a widespread outbreak could disrupt international tourism and dent economic growth.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) fell more than 4%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) fell nearly 3%.
In industrials, meanwhile, Boeing (NYSE:BA) slumped 3.3% after the aircraft maker pushed back its timetable for regulators to approve the return of the 737 MAX to the middle of the year. That added about 73 points to the Dow's losses.
A rise in real estate, however, led by Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI), Macerich (NYSE:MAC) and American Tower (NYSE:AMT), helped stem broader-market losses. 
In tech, FANG stocks ended mostly in the red, led by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), offsetting gains in chipmakers Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU).
Jefferies upgraded its rating on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to hold from underperform, sending Intel 1.6% higher.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 7% after New Street raised its price target on the stock to a sell-side high of $800 from $530."

Investing.com - Uber (NYSE:UBER) surged on Tuesday as traders cheered signs that the ride-hailing is ramping up efforts to cut losses following the sale of its Eats business in India to competitor Zomato.
Under the terms of the deal, Uber took a 9.99% stake in competitor Zomato and its Eats users would become part of the Indian company.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) jumped 6%.
Uber will continue to offer its ride-hailing service in India as it seeks to make up ground on local competitor Ola. The sale comes as the company looks to pave a path toward profitability by offloading loss-making businesses.
In its third-quarter report, the ride-hailing company reported a net loss of $1.16 billion, topping its $986 million loss from the prior year.
CEO Dara Khosrowshah said that the company is targeting adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) profitability in 2021.
As part of the initiatives to drive growth, Khosrowshah indicated the focus for Uber would shift from discounting to investing in technology that would bring down costs.
When entering new markets, ride-hailing businesses like Uber have often used bonuses and discounts to recruit drivers and passengers.
Uber's efforts to turn a profit appear to have drawn a mixed response on Wall Street. Just last week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was reported to have sold its entire stake iUber in the fourth quarter, CNBC reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the move.
But   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) analyst Brian Nowak on Tuesday dubbed Uber his top internet stock pick for 2020 on Tuesday, citing signs of improved profit improvement in both its ride-hailing and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats businesses. 
""The two-player U.S. rideshare market continues to be more profit-focused and we expect the decline in available private funding for cash-burning competitors (post-WeWork) to make the non-U.S. markets more rational,"" Nowark said. "
47,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 03:01PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Apple dropped plan for encrypting backups after FBI complained - sources,"By Joseph Menn
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) dropped plans to let iPhone users fully encrypt backups of their devices in the company's iCloud service after the FBI complained that the move would harm investigations, six sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The tech giant's reversal, about two years ago, has not previously been reported. It shows how much Apple has been willing to help U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, despite taking a harder line in high-profile legal disputes with the government and casting itself as a defender of its customers' information.
The long-running tug of war between investigators' concerns about security and tech companies' desire for user privacy moved back into the public spotlight last week, as U.S. Attorney General William Barr took the rare step of publicly calling on Apple to unlock two iPhones used by a Saudi Air Force officer who shot dead three Americans at a Pensacola, Florida naval base last month. 
U.S. President Donald Trump piled on, accusing Apple on Twitter of refusing to unlock phones used by ""killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements."" Republican and Democratic senators sounded a similar theme in a December hearing, threatening legislation against end-to-end encryption, citing unrecoverable evidence of crimes against children.
Apple did in fact did turn over the shooter's iCloud backups in the Pensacola case, and said it rejected the characterization that it ""has not provided substantive assistance."" 
Behind the scenes, Apple has provided the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation with more sweeping help, not related to any specific probe. 
An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the company’s handling of the encryption issue or any discussions it has had with the FBI. The FBI did not respond to requests for comment on any discussions with Apple.
More than two years ago, Apple told the FBI that it planned to offer users end-to-end encryption when storing their phone data on iCloud, according to one current and three former FBI officials and one current and one former Apple employee.
Under that plan, primarily designed to thwart hackers, Apple would no longer have a key to unlock the encrypted data, meaning it would not be able to turn material over to authorities in a readable form even under court order. 
In private talks with Apple soon after, representatives of the FBI's cyber crime agents and its operational technology division objected to the plan, arguing it would deny them the most effective means for gaining evidence against iPhone-using suspects, the government sources said. 
When Apple spoke privately to the FBI about its work on phone security the following year, the end-to-end encryption plan had been dropped, according to the six sources. Reuters could not determine why exactly Apple dropped the plan. 
""Legal killed it, for reasons you can imagine,"" another former Apple employee said he was told, without any specific mention of why the plan was dropped or if the FBI was a factor in the decision. 
That person told Reuters the company did not want to risk being attacked by public officials for protecting criminals, sued for moving previously accessible data out of reach of government agencies or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption. 
""They decided they weren't going to poke the bear anymore,"" the person said, referring to Apple's court battle with the FBI in 2016 over access to an iPhone used by one of the suspects in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. 
Apple appealed a court order to break into that phone for the FBI. The government dropped the proceedings when it found a contractor that could break into the phone, a common occurrence in FBI investigations.
Two of the former FBI officials, who were not present in talks with Apple, told Reuters it appeared that the FBI's arguments that the backups provided vital evidence in thousands of cases had prevailed. 
""It's because Apple was convinced,"" said one. ""Outside of that public spat over San Bernardino, Apple gets along with the federal government.""
However, a former Apple employee said it was possible the encryption project was dropped for other reasons, such as concern that more customers would find themselves locked out of their data more often.
Once the decision was made, the 10 or so experts on the Apple encryption project - variously code-named Plesio and KeyDrop - were told to stop working on the effort, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
APPLE SHIFTS FOCUS
Apple's decision not to proceed with end-to-end encryption of iCloud backups made the FBI’s job easier. 
The agency relies on hacking software that exploits security flaws to break into a phone. But that method requires direct access to the phone which would ordinarily tip off the user, who is often the subject of the investigation.
Apple’s iCloud, on the other hand, can be searched in secret. In the first half of last year, the period covered by Apple’s most recent semiannual transparency report on requests for data it receives from government agencies, U.S. authorities armed with regular court papers asked for and obtained full device backups or other iCloud content in 1,568 cases, covering about 6,000 accounts.
The company said it turned over at least some data for 90% of the requests it received. It turns over data more often in response to secret U.S. intelligence court directives, which sought content from more than 18,000 accounts in the first half of 2019, the most recently reported six-month period. 
Had it proceeded with its plan, Apple would not have been able to turn over any readable data belonging to users who opted for end-to-end encryption.
Instead of protecting all of iCloud with end-to-end encryption, Apple has shifted to focus on protecting some of the most sensitive user information, such as saved passwords and health data.
But backed-up contact information and texts from iMessage, WhatsApp and other encrypted services remain available to Apple employees and authorities. 
Apple is not the only tech company to have removed its own access to customers' information. 
In October 2018, Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google announced a similar system to Apple’s dropped plan for secure backups. The maker of Android software, which runs on about three-quarters of the world's mobile devices, said users could back up their data to its own cloud without trusting the company with the key.
Two people familiar with the project said Google gave no advance notice to governments, and picked a time to announce it when encryption was not in the news. 

The company continues to offer the service but declined to comment on how many users have taken up the option. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment on Google’s service or the agency’s approach to it.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Tuesday that Turkey's state-owned Halkbank (IS:HALKB) should be subjected to escalating fines totaling millions of dollars until it responds in court to criminal charges it helped Iran evade U.S. economic sanctions.
In a filing in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors said Halkbank should be fined an initial $1 million a day for contempt of court, and which could double each week to counter the bank's ""obstinacy"" in refusing to defend itself in court.
Such a penalty ""is an appropriate and necessary sanction to apply a sufficient coercive pressure to cause the defendant to cease its contempt and appear in this matter,"" prosecutors said.
A U.S.-based lawyer for Halkbank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The proposed fine could total $7 million after the first week of non-compliance and $21 million after two weeks, and nearly $1.8 billion by the end of eight weeks.
U.S. prosecutors announced fraud and money laundering charges in the case on Oct. 15, saying Halkbank and its executives used money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions.
Prosecutors also said Halkbank undertook transactions on Iran's behalf that would have exposed the bank to sanctions, including allowing revenue from oil and gas sales to be spent on gold, and facilitating sham purchases of food and medicine.
Last month, U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, who oversees the case, rejected Halkbank's request to put the case on hold.
He said the public had a strong interest in a ""prompt adjudication"" of Halkbank's alleged role in a conspiracy to undermine the sanctions, including through the alleged transfer of $20 billion of otherwise restricted Iranian funds.
A hearing is scheduled for Feb. 25. Halkbank has asked a federal appeals court in Manhattan to stay the case.
The dispute has caused tension in U.S.-Turkish relations, and nine people have been criminally charged.
They included former Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was convicted in January 2018 after another defendant, wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, pleaded guilty and testified against him.
Atilla returned to Turkey last year after leaving prison, and became general manager of the Istanbul Stock Exchange.

The case is U.S. v. Halkbank, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 15-cr-00867.

49,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 02:27PM ET</span>","Trump Sees ‘Big Trade Deal’ With EU, Repeats Auto Tariff Threat","(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
President Donald Trump is gearing up another attempt at trade talks with the European Union and is hopeful the two can reach a “big trade deal,” with the head of the European Commission calling on the sides to draw on their similarities as the process unfolds.
“A deal between ourselves and essentially Europe is something we all want to be able to make,” Trump told reporters Tuesday in Davos, Switzerland, repeating a threat to impose tariffs on imported European cars if trade talks don’t succeed.
Speaking during a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, he said she is known as a “very tough negotiator, which is bad news for us, because we’re going to talk about a big trade deal.”
The meeting comes as President Emmanuel Macron of France and Trump agreed Monday to a truce in their dispute over digital taxes that will mean neither France nor the U.S. will impose punitive tariffs this year.
It also came 18 months after Trump promised to park his auto tariffs after reaching a truce with Von der Leyen’s predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker, that was supposed to clear the way for negotiations over reducing industrial tariffs. Those negotiations have never gone anywhere largely because Congress has objected to agriculture not being included in the discussions.
Intrigue has also surrounded Trump’s auto-tariffs threat since the administration passed through a deadline for action last year without doing anything. Some senior officials in the White House are known to oppose moving ahead with the duties on vehicles, arguing they would be too economically disruptive.
Von der Leyen said the U.S. and EU “never should forget” their “long history of common foundation.”
The nations share “a lot of business contacts, friendship, youth exchange, science, culture since way more than 70 years so the American people and the European people are good friends,” she said. “We have issues to discuss and we will negotiate.”
But the new European Commission that Von der Leyen leads has already taken a more aggressive approach to trade.
The new EU trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, on a visit to Washington last week called Trump’s tariff threats short-sighted electioneering and warned that the EU would fight back if Trump imposed any tariffs.
EU Trade Chief Calls Trump ‘Obsessed,’ Questions U.S.-China Deal
Trump’s “America First” agenda had helped bring about “a high-pressure crisis moment for the international trading system,” Hogan said in a speech in Washington Jan. 16.
“If we go about this in the right way, working together, the mutual benefits can be very significant,” Hogan told a conference in the U.S. capital on Thursday. “But, if we fail to do so, the damage will be significant, not alone for us both, but for the world.”
Hogan last week also warned that the EU was looking at a deal signed by the U.S. and China on Jan. 15 that foresees an increase in imports of American goods and services by $200 billion over the next two years. The Asian nation’s pledge to boost imports from the U.S. could end up costing the EU about $11 billion next year, according to a study by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank.
Germany and France will be particularly hard hit by trade diversions, according to the study’s authors, Sonali Chowdhry and Gabriel Felbermayr. The largest negative effects for the EU are expected in aircrafts, vehicles, industrial and medical machinery, pharmaceuticals, and other agricultural goods."

(Reuters) - Attorneys for a former Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) executive on Tuesday will try to convince a skeptical judge of a core tenet of tech startup culture - that employees can plan a competing venture while still in a job.
Apple's lawsuit against a former chip executive-turned-rival will have implications for employees all over California who are considering striking out on their own and creating the startups that drive tech business and culture.
California's long-held public policy favors employee mobility in contrast to states that allow strong non-compete agreements. That stance allowed for the ""traitorous eight"" who left their jobs at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory for a rival in the late 1950s and who eventually spawned dozens of companies, including  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
Apple filed the lawsuit in Santa Clara County Superior Court against Gerard Williams (NYSE:WMB) III, who left the company last year after more than nine years as chief architect for the custom processors that power iPhones and iPads to start Nuvia Inc, which is designing chips for servers. 
Judge Mark H. Pierce last week issued a tentative ruling allowing the case to proceed but barring Apple from seeking punitive damages. Pierce will decide after a hearing on Tuesday whether to make his ruling final. 
Apple sued Williams in August, alleging that he breached an intellectual property agreement and a duty of loyalty to the company by planning his new startup while on company time at Apple, spending hours on the phone with colleagues who eventually joined the venture.
Apple declined to comment on the case. Through a spokesman, Williams declined to comment. Apple is not suing Nuvia itself or any of Williams' co-founders and it did not allege any intellectual property or trade secret theft.
According to a copy of Williams' agreement that Apple attached to its complaint, the contract required that Williams ""will not plan or engage in any other employment"" that competes with Apple or is directly related to the company.
In a filing in November, Williams argued that Apple's contract was unenforceable because California law allows employees to make some preparations to compete while still in their current job.
Even in California, there are limits, said Cliff Palefsky, a prominent San Francisco-based employment attorney. Workers can lay some plans for a competitor on their own time, but recruiting fellow employees on company time ""gets a little dicey.""
In his tentative ruling, Pierce wrote that ""an employee is not permitted to plan and prepare to create a competitive enterprise prior to termination if the employee does so on their employer’s time and with the employer’s resources.""
The case will likely hinge the specific facts of Williams' planning for Nuvia, Palefsky said. Given that work at modern tech jobs rarely sticks to traditional business hours, it may be difficult to untangle whether calls were made during company time or personal time.
""That phrase - that you can't plan to compete - raises a very interesting question of whether (Apple's contract) is violative of the public policy and whether the courts are going to enforce it,"" he said. ""This is going to be some groundbreaking stuff, one way or the other.""

The court has not set a trial date.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Avenatti is living in a jail cell that reportedly once housed convicted Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, making it impossible for the celebrity lawyer to prepare for his upcoming extortion trial, his lawyers said.
In a filing late on Monday night, Avenatti's lawyers said their client is in solitary confinement under 24-hour lockdown on a floor in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan that houses people charged with terrorism offenses.
They also said Avenatti has ""great difficulty functioning,"" is sleeping with three blankets because the temperature feels like the mid-40s (6-8 degrees Celsius) and faces ""special administrative measures"" that almost completely block contact with outsiders.
While jail officials have been ""professional, respectful and courteous,"" Avenatti's lawyers want him moved to the general population, where he can meet with them and better prepare for trial, which could start next week.
Jail officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Avenatti, 48, became well known for representing pornography actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against U.S. President Donald Trump.
The Manhattan jail has long faced criticism for its living conditions.
At his sentencing last July, Guzman described living there as ""psychological, emotional, mental torture 24 hours a day."" {nL2N24I0GT]
Guzman and Sayfullo Saipov, who was charged with killing eight people by driving a pickup truck down a Manhattan bike lane in October 2017, are among other MCC inmates to have faced special administrative measures.
The jail is also where the financier Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide last August while awaiting trial on sexual abuse charges.
Avenatti was charged with threatening to publicize accusations that  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) illegally paid families of college basketball recruits unless the sportswear company paid him $15 million to $25 million to conduct a probe.
Prosecutors also charged him with concealing a settlement offer from his client.

Avenatti has pleaded not guilty. He was jailed last week in California after prosecutors there said he violated bail conditions in a separate criminal case. Avenatti was flown on Friday to Manhattan.

Industrial and consumer shares were among the worst performers as the S&P 500 Index fell from a record high. That followed pullbacks in Asia and Europe, with Hong Kong the hardest hit. Luxury stocks headed for their biggest drop since October on worries the virus will disrupt spending during a key Chinese holiday period. Banks retreated after UBS Group AG missed profitability targets; Boeing (NYSE:BA) slumped on speculation its 737 Max jet wouldn’t be cleared to fly until mid-year.
The risk-off mood helped support some traditional haven assets, and the yen and Treasuries advanced.
The emergence of the illness in China -- and concerns it could be spreading outside the country -- stirred memories of the SARS outbreak 17 years ago for some market watchers, though it isn’t yet as serious. The developments provided an excuse for investors who bid up U.S. stocks to record highs last week to take a pause and assess the outlook for global growth and corporate profits as earnings season picks up.
“History tells us that most of these situations can be contained,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist for  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. “What we would watch for is does it become a big enough issue that it actually starts to change consumer behavior?”

53,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 02:16PM ET</span>",Factbox: How a virus impacts the economy and markets,"By Ritvik Carvalho
(Reuters) - The outbreak of a new virus in China has sent shivers through world financial markets, with investors drawing comparisons to the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in order to assess its potential economic impact.
The following factbox collates the estimates of the economic impacts of past such episodes as well as individual company winners and losers from the current outbreak.
1) GLOBAL ECONOMIC & FINANCIAL MARKET IMPACT
A 2017 paper https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5791779 by economists Victoria Fan, Dean Jamison and Lawrence Summers estimated that the expected annual losses from pandemic risk to be about $500 billion - or 0.6% of global income - per year, accounting for both lost income and the intrinsic cost of elevated mortality.
Another 2016 study https://nam.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Neglected-Dimension-of-Global-Security.pdf by the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimated that pandemic disease events would cost the global economy over $6 trillion in the 21st century - over $60 billion per year.
Isolating the impact of a single factor on global stock indexes and the global economy is a formidable task: they reflect a multiplicity of simultaneously competing factors ranging from economic data, company performance, and geopolitical shifts. In the middle of the SARS outbreak for instance, the U.S. invasion of Iraq would have exerted an equivalent if not greater impact on price action.
However, price action in markets indicates that the impacts of such outbreaks are limited. After Chinese authorities reported the outbreak of SARS to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2003, the MSCI China index of shares decoupled from its global peers - but made up the lost ground in only six months.
GRAPHIC: SARS had a limited effect on Chinese equities https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1340/1322/MSCI_china.png
2) ECONOMIC COST OF SARS OUTBREAK 2003
This https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92473/#ch2.s8 paper by Jong-Wha Lee and Warwick McKibbin estimates the global economic loss due at SARS at $40 billion in 2003.
A May 2006 economic briefing by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated that world gross domestic product suffered a 0.1% hit due to the outbreak.

3) MARKET WINNERS AND LOSERS
Despite the disruption to the wider economy, virus outbreaks have tended to benefit pharmaceutical stocks, while tourism and travel-related stocks - hotels, airlines and luxury and consumer goods - tend to get punished. During the SARS outbreak, retail sales figures in China showed a marked drop-off as consumer spending took a hit.
GRAPHIC: Consumer spending in China sank during the SARS outbreak https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1345/1327/consumerspendingchina.png
On Tuesday, Chinese drugmakers Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies Co Ltd , Shandong Lukang Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (SS:600789), and Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co Ltd (SS:600276) were among those outperforming the wider market. Facemask manufacturers Tianjin Teda Co Ltd (SZ:000652) and Shanghai Dragon Corp (SS:600630) also outperformed.
Shares of long-haul flight operators Air France (PA:AIRF), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) retreated, as news of the contagion raised concerns over disruptions to travel during a coming Chinese holiday.

China-exposed luxury goods makers including LVMH (PA:LVMH),  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Hermes (PA:HRMS) and  Burberry  (L:BRBY) also fell.
4) MORTALITY RATE AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
An IMF paper https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2018/06/economic-risks-and-impacts-of-epidemics/bloom.pdf by David Bloom, Daniel Cadarette, and JP Sevilla notes that even when the health impact of an outbreak is relatively limited, economic consequences can be quickly magnified. The authors cite the case of Liberia during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which saw GDP growth decline even as the country's overall death rate fell over the same period.
GRAPHIC: Liberia GDP vs. death rate during Ebola crisis https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1341/1323/liberia.png
""What scared people about SARS is the mortality rate,"" ING Asia Pacific's chief economist Robert Carnell said in a note to clients.
""People didn't take public transport, stayed away from work, stayed away from shops, restaurants, cinemas, conferences etc. The impact from the disease was massive on the economy, but almost all of it indirect, due to the precautionary behavior of the population.""

Here are the highlights from Day 1:
THUNBERG V TRUMP: A TRILLION TREES IS NOT ENOUGH
Greta Thunberg and U.S. President Donald Trump dominated as they both attempted to frame arguments around climate change. Speaking thousand miles away from where his impeachment trial was due to start, Trump backed a tree planting initiative and dismissed the ""perennial prophets of doom"" on climate change.
Trump did not name Thunberg, but she was sitting in the audience and responded less than an hour later in a packed auditorium. ""Our house is still on fire,"" Thunberg said, repeating her warning at the WEF meeting a year ago.
""Your inaction is fuelling the flames,"" the 17-year-old added, in the latest to-and-fro with the 73-year-old president.
GRETA EXPECTATIONS: YOUTHFUL ENERGY AT DAVOS
Often seen as the preserve of rich, old men, this year's Davos has been invigorated by fresh voices, energy and Doc Martens with many young activists following their role model Thunberg up the Alps.
The first panel of the four-day gathering made clear the shift, with a combined age of 64, much younger than the WEF's 81-year-old founder Klaus Schwab.
CARRIE CHARM OFFENSIVE
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam and ""Team HK"", including its trade secretary, top officials from the stock exchange, airport authority, MTR Corp (HK:0066) and the head of Swire Group, are on a mission to reassure after a Moody's downgrade this week.
Lam sought to convince global business and political leaders that the Asian financial hub is open for business. 
APPLE CEO TO EAT WITH TRUMP 
Apple (O:AAPL) chief executive Tim Cook will attend a breakfast meeting with Trump on Wednesday. On Tuesday evening Trump was to dine with several CEOs in a meeting organized with the help of Trump's adviser and daughter, Ivanka Trump, a source familiar with the situation said.
REVEALED: HOW SAUDIS WILL SPEND ARAMCO WINDFALL
Saudi finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters on the sidelines of Davos that the proceeds of last month's listing of oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) would be pumped into the local economy over several years, including building up defense systems.
With nearly $30 billion coming from Aramco's local share offering last month, new and existing local industries, including defense and technology, will get a boost, Jadaan said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Reynolds Consumer Products said on Tuesday it is looking to raise up to $1.32 billion in an initial public offering (IPO), potentially setting up the first $1 billion-plus U.S. listing of 2020.
Reynolds will come to market after such mega deals in 2019 on average delivered their best first month of trading since 2014, though they still lagged the broader U.S. IPO market, according to data provider Dealgoic.
One issue with such large deals is securing enough demand as well as discerning which investors buying shares are long-term holders of the stock and which will be looking to sell out quickly.
The U.S. IPO market got off to a sluggish start last week with a trickle of sub-$150 million deals.
In a regulatory filing, Reynolds said it would look to sell 41.17 million shares at a target price range of $25-$28 per share. At the top end, the IPO would value Reynolds at $5.67 billion.

Lake Forest, Illinois-based Reynolds is likely to price its IPO on Jan. 30 before debuting on the Nasdaq the following day under the symbol ""REYN"".
Reynolds primarily sells cooking products, waste and storage products and tableware through several brands, including Reynolds and Hefty.
After the IPO, just over three quarters of the company's voting power will be controlled by New Zealand billionaire Graeme Hart. Rank Group, Hart's investment firm, in 2008 bought Alcoa's packaging and consumer businesses which later became Reynolds Consumer Products through multiple add-on acquisitions.
For 2019, Reynolds said it expects net income to be between $220 million and $224 million, up from $176 million in 2018, though net revenues are seen slipping to around $3 billion from $3.14 billion a year earlier.
The company plans to use the IPO proceeds to pay down a portion of its debt.
Reynolds had eyed completing a public listing towards the end of 2019 but was among a slew of companies to postpone IPO plans because of investor pushback against company valuations, Reuters reported last month.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan are the leading underwriting banks on the IPO."

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive David Solomon called WeWork's abandoned initial public offering (IPO) a great example of the listing process working on Tuesday, even if was ""not as pretty as everybody would like it to be"".
Goldman was one of investment banks that would have led the IPO last year, after convincing the office space-sharing start-up it could improve on the $47 billion valuation in a private fundraising round it secured in January 2019.
The IPO was canceled after investors raised questions about WeWork's valuation and corporate governance arrangements that gave its co-founder Adam Neumann too much control.
WeWork ended up facing a cash crunch, and was rescued by shareholder SoftBank Group Corp in October in a $9.5 billion deal that gave the Japanese group majority control.
""The banks were not valuing (WeWork). Banks give you a model. You say to the company, well, if you can prove to us that the model actually does what it does, then it's possible that the company is worth this in the public markets,"" Solomon said.
WeWork was considering a valuation of as low as $10 billion and $12 billion at the time it was preparing for an IPO in September, Reuters reported at the time.
Solomon told a conference panel at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland that the process worked because due diligence and feedback by potential IPO investors ""ground it in reality.""
While 2019 had promised to be a bumper year for IPOs, investor confidence fizzled out. Shares of some high-profile start-ups such as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) languished in the months following their listings. A few companies, such as WeWork, canceled their stock market debuts, because of investor pushback against their valuations.
""If you bought a package of all the IPOs that came to market in 2019 I think you returned 34% and outperformed the broader market a little bit. But there were companies that did not perform well and did not meet the expectations that were set,"" Solomon said.
Cheap money, driven by low interest rates, is pushing investors to take risks, and this has led them to overvalue some companies' growth projections and not focus on their underlying earnings, Solomon said.
Solomon added that the fact that Saudi Aramco's $29.4 billion IPO attracted primarily domestic, rather than international, investors last month was because the valuation pitched to them on the local exchange was not attractive enough."

Investing.com - Concerns of the coronavirus in China spreading and hurting air travel weighed on airline stocks earlier Tuesday and those worries are also pressuring casino stocks.
Authorities have now confirmed six deaths from the coronavirus, a pneumonia-like disease that is capable of being transmitted from person to person. The outbreak, which started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has shown signs of spreading throughout the country, triggering fears of a repeat of the 2002 SARS epidemic.
Any hesitation about travel in China would hit business in Macau, the center of gambling in the Far East and an important revenue stream for public gaming companies.

The Japanese carmaker is the latest manufacturer to be investigated on suspicion of hiding illegal levels of pollution following a regulatory clampdown on toxic fumes triggered by Volkswagen's 2015 admission that it had cheated emissions tests. 
Carmakers used engine management software to detect when a car was undergoing an emissions test cycle, and throttled back toxic fumes to hide the vehicle's real-world pollution levels.
The prosecutor's office said in a statement that officials are investigating a member of staff at an international carmaker for fraud, as well as a unit of an international car dealership company, and two auto suppliers. 
In a statement, Mitsubishi Motors said it had been informed about an investigation of its German distributor as well as of its European R&D facilities, also based in Germany, by local authorities.
""No further information is available at that stage. Mitsubishi Motors will of course collaborate and contribute to this investigation,"" the carmaker said.
Cars made by the company equipped with 1.6 liter and 2.2 liter four-cylinder diesel engines are being investigated over the possible use of an illegal defeat device, the prosecutor's office said.
Premises have been searched in Frankfurt, Hanover and Regensburg in Germany as part of the probe, it added. 
German auto supplier Continental said it is a cooperating witness in the probe. Automotive supplier Bosch said it was not involved.
Bosch (ROBG.UL) last year agreed to pay a 90 million euro ($100.21 million) fine for lapses in supervisory duties which enabled carmakers to engage in emissions cheating.
Following Volkswagen's 2015 admission that it had rigged engine software with ""defeat devices"" to cheat U.S. diesel tests, several European states launched investigations.
They found on-the-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions more than 10 times above regulatory limits for some Opel,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Fiat Chrysler models, and widespread use of devices that reduce or shut down exhaust treatment during normal use.

French prosecutors opened criminal probes into Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Renault, PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler in 2016-17 that remain ongoing.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) plans to scale down its foreign exchange business by the end of the year, stung by low profitability and rising competition from its rivals, three sources familiar with the matter said.
As part of a global strategic review announced in early 2018, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, which is widely seen as a bellwether for the UK economy, announced plans to focus more on its digital offering and the small- and medium-sized sector.
A source familiar with the situation said the bank would restrict its directly managed FX offering to G10 currencies such as the dollar, pound and euro.
Most cuts will come in the corporate FX sales division, said the person, adding that the FX business would for the most part go electronic.
About 10 jobs are ""at risk"", one ex-employee said, noting that Lloyds had already been trimming its foreign exchange team, especially on the corporate sales desk.
A spokeswoman said the bank remained committed to servicing their clients for their foreign exchange needs across the major and emerging market currencies and had no plans to change their offering.
No figures were immediately available on the actual number of people employed in Lloyds' FX business, or how many jobs would ultimately be lost.
But a third source said job losses were a certainty, with the cuts likely to be completed before June.
Lloyds last week warned its 60,000 staff to expect a cut in bonus payments after the bank took a 1.8 billion-pound ($2.35 billion) hit on mis-sold loan insurance payouts, The Guardian reported, citing an internal staff memo.
While no data was available on how big Lloyds' currency trading business was, one influential industry consultancy estimated it at around $200 million - tiny compared to $3 billion to $4 billion at  Citigroup  (N:C).
But even if Lloyds is a minor player in the global $6.6 trillion a day foreign exchange market, its retreat would be part of a broader trend whereby many lenders have exited FX trading due to relentlessly shrinking margins.
Years of record low volatility have made it hard to generate profits from currency trading, and the retreat of small players has seen top-five banks tighten their grip on the market, holding as much as 50% of the business."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam sought on Tuesday to convince global business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the Asian financial hub is open for business.
Hong Kong's status has come under scrutiny as seven months of sometimes violent demonstrations paralyzed parts of the city and forced businesses to close, posing the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012. 
Lam and ""Team HK"", including its trade secretary, top officials from the stock exchange, airport authority, MTR Corp and the head of Swire Group, are in the Swiss mountain resort after Moody's this week downgraded Hong Kong.
Laura Cha, chairwoman of bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd told Reuters on Tuesday the Chinese-ruled city had held up remarkably well despite the protests.
""We are resilient. We are stable and investors still have confidence in us,"" Cha said in Davos. 
""The rule of law is sound in Hong Kong."" 
Speaking in an interview with CNBC in Davos, Hong Kong's Lam said she was ""very disappointed"" by the Moody's decision. 
""I am even more disappointed by their assessment of the Hong
Kong situation, and their comment on the weak institutions and
governance,"" said Lam. 
Since its return to Beijing in 1997, the former British colony has been governed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that guarantees it broad freedoms not seen in mainland China, including an independent judiciary and free press. 
Those liberties, which protesters say Beijing is gradually chipping away at, are widely viewed as central to the city's prosperity and any erosion could have a significant impact on its status as an international financial center. 
""The biggest concern for foreign investors is around the long-term position of Hong Kong as a global financial center,"" said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of Hong Kong-based consultancy Quinlan & Associates and a former  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist. 
""More importantly, there are questions around whether the fundamental, underlying rule of law in the city will be maintained ... and whether it will stand the test of time."" 
CREDIBILITY CRISIS Another challenge in 2020 will be to tame the protest movement, which kicked off the year with a rally that organizers said drew 1 million people, and bolster support for the beleaguered government ahead of key elections in September.
On Sunday, police fired teargas to disperse thousands gathered in Chater Garden, a small open park ringed by the Asian headquarters of leading global investment banks and law firms. 
""There will be a major crisis of governability because I think the government has no credibility and I think it faces major resistance, both in the legislature and district councils,"" said Ma Ngok, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
A resounding victory for pan-democrats in local elections in November dealt a huge blow to the pro-Beijing camp and marked a significant political shift amid months of protests that shocked a city where violence is rare. As the protest movement still enjoys broad support, some observers expect Beijing to lean harder on the city to silence activists and curb a surge in anti-China sentiment that has rattled mainland Chinese living in Hong Kong and prompted some, including many students, to leave. 
Others expect the deep-seated political tensions to intensify and further polarize society. 
""By summer we shall witness deeper political conflict within society, coinciding with crippling economic actions and feeding of growing disenfranchisement of working and middle classes,"" said Phill Hynes, head of political risk and analysis at ISS risk. 
""2020 is not going to be the year Hong Kong heals, it will be the year it festers and becomes inflamed."" 
A survey conducted for Reuters in December found 59% of city residents supported the protest movement, while 57% said they favored the resignation of Beijing-backed Lam. 
President Xi has repeatedly voiced support for Lam, who has rejected calls to step down. According to an audio recording obtained by Reuters of remarks Lam made to a group of business people in August, Hong Kong's leader said she would ""quit"" if she could.
In public, Lam remains defiant and rejects any link between the protests and political reform.
""Hong Kong is not alone in facing social problems related to topics such as upward mobility, youth discontent, income disparity and housing affordability,"" she said in the Jan. 16 release. ""We know we need to deal with these issues, and we will."" 
While the demonstrations have at times closed businesses, shopping malls, schools, and even the international airport, life for many in the city goes on, while Hong Kong's financial markets have proved resilient. The unrest has, however, drawn corporate heavyweights including HSBC and Cathay Pacific into the political turmoil, underscoring the tightrope businesses must navigate between protesters and the city's political masters in Beijing. 
The protests have also taken a heavy toll on the economy - which sank into recession for the first time in a decade in the third quarter - in particular the retail and tourism sectors.

MILAN (Reuters) - European luxury stocks slumped across the board on Tuesday on fears that the coronavirus virus outbreak in China could hurt sales of high-end brands that had managed to weather months of protests in Hong Kong.
Chinese shoppers account for 35% of global luxury goods sales and 90% of last year's growth in the market, according to consultancy Bain & Company, which produces closely followed forecasts for the sector.
Such statistics illustrate the damage that could be done to luxury goods companies if health fears deter Chinese consumers from traveling or going shopping at home.
Shares in some of the top luxury players, from industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH) to the likes of  Richemont  (S:CFR),  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), were down by between 1.9% and 3% on Tuesday afternoon. Declines had been as much as 4% in early trading, wiping $15 billion off the sector's market value.
Moncler (MI:MONC) is among the most exposed brands, given that it derived 43% of its revenues from Asia in 2018. The company known for its down jackets retreated 2.6% in afternoon trading. Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER), which ranks Asia Pacific as its top market with a 38% share of total revenue, fell 2%. 
The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose to six on Tuesday and nearly 300 people were diagnosed, almost all of them in China.

HIGH SEASON
The timing could hardly be worse, with hundreds of millions of people preparing to travel for the Lunar New Year, stoking concerns infection rates may accelerate during the week-long holiday that is also a peak retail season in China and overseas.
""I think we need to fasten our seat belts for the next few days and see if this is something that the Chinese authorities can contain,"" said Bernstein research analyst Luca Solca, adding that the impact on the luxury goods industry could be felt as soon as this quarter if the outbreak spreads or accelerates.
Before the virus scare, the sector as a whole had been trading at about 24 times 2021 earnings estimates, representing an 80% premium to the wider STOXX 600 index, according to a note by broker Equita. 
Recent gains have been fueled by signs the industry had broadly managed to offset the sales impact from the Hong Kong protests with growth in mainland China and other Asian markets. 
A truce reached by Washington and Beijing last week in their 18-month trade war also lifted shares in the sector, as did the prospect of solid fourth-quarter earnings for the leading players.
""Given the recent run higher, this is as good a time as any to take profits in the luxury sector,"" one London-based trader said.
Chinese travel booking platforms such as Trip.com (O:TCOM) and  Alibaba  Group's (N:BABA) Fliggy said they would offer free cancellations on bookings made for Wuhan, the city that has been the epicenter of the outbreak, and some Chinese travelers told Reuters they were taking no chances and would change their plans.
The outbreak has evoked memories of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus that also originated in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide in 2002-03. 
At that time, Chinese spending accounted for less than 10% of the luxury market, but the fallout from the health scare left the sector trading at less than 15 times estimated earnings, according to Bernstein.

Investing.com - Shares of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) took off again on Tuesday as investors bet that Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) would eventually look to the company as a supplier.
Beyond Meat soared 11.6% in midday trading after Starbucks announced an environmental push to add more plant-based food and drinks to its menu and also more options in reusable packaging.
There was no indication from the coffee chain giant on when it may add items like plant-based breakfast sausages to its menu or which products it might choose.
A spokeswoman told Reuters that the company is exploring meat alternatives for its breakfast menu, but declined comment on potential suppliers.
But the prospect was enough to jolt the volatile Beyond Meat shares again.
The company hasn’t been public for a year, but has seen some roller-coaster action after its IPO in May 2019 when it opened at $45.
Shares rocketed up to a high of $239.71in July only to face a fairly steady decline into the end of the year.
But the stock has a new lease on life in 2020 and is up 65% year to date, including the pop in today’s session.
The plant-based meat category is expected to be worth $140 billion in the next decade, according to   Barclays   (LON:BARC).
For now, the world's largest coffee chain has laid out targets for 2030 including halving landfill waste from stores, and carbon emissions from its direct operations and supply chain. These targets were informed by research from the World Wildlife Fund and sustainability consultant Quantis.

(Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services firm Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co. on Tuesday disclosed a $2.2 billion charge to earnings as weakening North American shale activity continued to hit the industry. 
The charge for asset impairments was centered on hydraulic fracturing and legacy drilling equipment units, and employee severance costs, the company said. Halliburton dismissed 8% of its North American staff at mid-year, and later cut staff across several western U.S. states. 
U.S. producers are pulling back on drilling and completing wells, pressured by investor demands to focus on debt reduction and returns. 
Rival Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) on Friday said it cut more than 1,400 workers, and would idle 50% of its hydraulic fracturing equipment due to weak demand. Fracking applies high pressure to release trapped oil and gas in shale wells. 
Schlumberger last year recorded a $12-billion charge to earnings and U.S. oil major  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) took an at least $10 billion charge on projects that were no longer economic to tap.
""The U.S. shale industry is facing its biggest test since the 2015 downturn, with both capital discipline and slowing leading edge efficiency gains weighing down activity and production,"" Halliburton Chief Executive Jeff Miller said on call with analysts. 
Halliburton will reduce capital spending by 20% this year, to $1.2 billion, executives said on the call, as North American customers further slash spending. It will recognize $50 million of the charges in the current quarter. 
The U.S. rig count has fallen by roughly 24% to 796 in the past year, according to rival Baker Hughes. Halliburton exited 2019 with 22% less working frack equipment than it began the year. 
Profit margins in units that drill, evaluate and put oil and gas wells into production will fall this quarter, it forecast. 
Excluding the charge, Halliburton topped analysts' estimates for quarterly profit, boosted by higher drilling activity outside North America, a recent bright spot for oilfield service providers. 
The company swung to a $1.7 billion loss in the fourth quarter on the charge. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 32 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of 29 cents, according to Refinitiv.
Shares were up 1.6% in early trading at $24.48.
Halliburton said revenue from North America fell over 30% to $2.33 billion, while international markets rose over 10% to $2.86 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.

Halliburton's total revenue fell 12.6% to $5.19 billion, but beat estimate of $5.10 billion.

Controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Mediaset (MI:MS) wants to merge its Italian and Spanish (MC:TL5) units into a Dutch entity, dubbed MediaforEurope (MFE).
The broadcaster wants to use the new entity to pursue tie-ups in Europe to take on competition from streaming apps such as Netflix (O:NFLX) and web giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)
But Vivendi, which is Mediaset's second largest shareholder with a 29% stake, is fighting the project in court, saying the governance structure of the new entity would strengthen Berlusconi's grip on the company.
Mediaset faces a March deadline to see its Dutch holding company plan through, otherwise the decisions of a September shareholder meeting that approved the project will no longer be valid based on existing Dutch laws."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's finance ministry has canvassed banks for ideas to boost the country's ""left-behind"" northern towns and cities, weeks after the governing Conservatives won an election promising to boost the regions outside London.
The call comes as figures show lending by banks to small and medium sized businesses has shrunk rapidly in the north of England.
Treasury officials have requested policy ideas for fuelling growth in the north of England in meetings with banks and finance industry trade bodies including since the new year, banking industry sources told Reuters.
Policy ideas drawn up by finance firms include developing better technical skills locally, setting up regional specialist hubs and moving financial regulators from London to give start-ups better support in meeting requirements when setting up.
Banks have attracted criticism for doing too little to support Britain's regional economies, including slashing their branch networks in small towns and rural areas.
Outstanding lending to small firms in the northwest and northeast of England fell by 15% and 8% respectively between the end of 2014 and June last year, according to data from trade body UK Finance, compared to a 2% increase in London. The regional lending trends were first reported by the Times newspaper. 
A spokesman for the Treasury confirmed officials had asked finance firms how they could play a role in boosting the regions.
""The financial services sector is vital to our economy, which is why we are working closely with firms to ensure that together we promote growth, create jobs and boost investment across the whole of the UK,"" the spokesman added.
The request comes ahead of finance minister Sajid Javid presenting the government's budget in March. Javid has said injecting cash into the regions will be a priority.
""We've been asked what do people in financial services need. It's very northern-specific and very northern-focussed,"" a banking source said. ""There's a recognition from officials that it can't all be about delivering shiny new infrastructure projects.""
NORTHERN FOCUS
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party won a big majority last month, winning scores of seats in the north of England, traditional heartlands of the opposition Labour Party.
Since then Johnson has pledged to 'level up' the regions to repay his new backers' support, although opposition politicians have expressed scepticism and blame the Conservatives' previous austerity policies for harming the regions.
Finance jobs are heavily skewed toward London, although several other cities each employ more than 30,000 people in the sector, including Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland, and Leeds and Manchester in northern England.
Britain has struggled for decades to find ways of fuelling regional growth outside London. The government already spends more than it generates in taxes in every part of Britain apart from London, the South-east and the East, according to Reuters analysis of public spending data.

Miles Celic, CEO of TheCityUK, a finance industry trade group, said: ""Ensuring the industry's future as a national asset will require a concerted effort. This includes more regionally focused policies and initiatives.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co (T:7267) will join on Tuesday a growing number of companies signing a White House pledge to boost U.S. job training opportunities.
The third largest Japanese automaker will announce in Ohio it will provide expanded job training opportunities to 50,000 workers by 2025.
Other major companies including Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google unit, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), American Airlines (O:AAL), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and General Motors Co (N:GM) are among more than 400 firms that previously agreed to offer education and training opportunities for U.S. students and workers.
Rick Schostek, executive vice president of Honda North America, said in an interview that the company has long been committed to offering job training for its employees, but was trying to be more public about it. He said the 50,000 training figure ""was a bit more than in the past.""
Last week, Honda announced it had built its 20 millionth automobile in Ohio since launching production in 1982 in Marysville, Ohio.
Honda has not always seen eye to eye with the White House. The company drew the ire of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump when it joined three other automakers last summer in adopting a voluntary emissions deal with California.
It also was among Japanese automakers that expressed dismay with Trump's March 2019 declaration that some imported vehicles and parts posed a threat to U.S. national security.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has emphasized the significant U.S. investments and employment by Japanese automakers in an effort to head off potential punitive U.S. tariffs on imports of Japanese-made vehicles and parts.
Honda employs about 15,000 people in Ohio, a key state in the 2020 election and nearly two-thirds of all Honda automobiles sold in the United States last year were made in America.
White House adviser Ivanka Trump said companies who are taking part “have pledged to ensure the continued success and growth of the American workforce.” She added Honda’s announcement “means that 50,000 people will now have the key skill sets needed to contribute to the jobs of tomorrow.”"

Investing.com - There’s a new Tesla bull on the block on Wall Street, with an analyst boosting his price target to $800 Tuesday, the highest on the sell side at present.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares jumped 5.9% in morning trading.
New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu, who already has a buy rating on shares, hiked his price target to $800 from $530, noting that key elements of the research firm’s bullish thesis through 2025 have been validated over the past year-and-a-half.
""We stick to our views and expect {{0|Tesla} to sell (2 million to 3 million) cars per year after 2025, at industry leading margins, justifying a market capitalization” of $230 billion to $350 billion, about $1,100 to $1,700 per share, Ferragu said in a note.
“Discounted back to early 2021, we would see that fully priced with a stock in the $640-$960 range,” he added. “On that basis, we increase our target price to $800.""
""The stock will remain volatile, as the spread between bull and bear cases remains wide, and God only knows what the next controversy will be,” Ferragu said.
But expectations for 2020 look low and the company should handily top expectation for free cash flow when it reports results next week, he said.

Investing.com -- Wall Street edged lower in early trade on Tuesday but pared premarket losses caused by a global wave of selling on fears of a possible epidemic in China.
Authorities have now confirmed six deaths from the so-called coronavirus, a pneumonia-like disease that is capable of being transmitted from person to person. The outbreak, which started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has shown signs of spreading throughout the country, triggering fears of a repeat of the 2002 SARS epidemic.
Airline stocks were particularly hard hit, with the ADRs of China Eastern (NYSE:CEA) and China Southern (NYSE:ZNH)Airlines fell 11.2% and 9.6% respectively on fears that an epidemic could hit passenger traffic. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock was the worst hit U.S. flyer, falling 2.6%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock fell 1.6% and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock fell 2.0% by 10 AM ET (1500 GMT).
The Dow Jones Industrial Index lost 41 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 fell 8 points, or 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite also fell 0.1%.
Elsewhere, Uber (NYSE:UBER) rose 2.8% to its highest since August after announcing it would retreat from its loss-making food delivery business in India. It’s selling the business to local rival Zomato in return for a 9.99% stake that will allow it to reap any eventual upside to a market that has yet to deliver decent returns.
Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) stock edged down 0.3% after the company said it will move up the scheduled launch of its Disney+ streaming service in most of western Europe by a week. The service will now hit Britain and Germany on March 24.
The company is under pressure to establish itself before rival streaming services from Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Apple (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AAPL) can gain decisive levels of market share. Market leader Netflix (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:NFLX) is due to report earnings after the close on Tuesday.
Earlier, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) stock rose 1.5% to its highest in nearly two weeks, after the oilfield services company beat consensus forecasts for adjusted earnings by some 10% in the last quarter of the year. As with rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), the group’s international performance rescued a quarter dominated at home by shale drillers cutting back on their investment spending. That led to the company taking a $2.2 billion charge, resulting in a net loss of $1.7 billion. And in Canada, Spin Master (OTC:SNMSF), the maker of children's toys and other entertainment products, fell 18% after saying it now expects sales to fall 1% this year, instead of growing slightly.
In other markets, U.S. crude oil futures fell 0.3% on fears for the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on airline travel and overall growth in China. Gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,552.05 a troy ounce, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies, gave up some of Monday’s gains to trade down 0.1% at 97.265."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog told financial advisers on Tuesday they face a two-year crackdown to stop unsuitable advice, investment scams and excessive fees.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in a ""Dear CEO"" letter to heads of financial advice firms it regulates that the sector has a valuable role to play.
""However, we are seeing an increasing number of cases where the actions of firms are resulting in significant harm to consumers' financial well-being,"" Debbie Gupta, the FCA's director of financial advice supervision, said in the letter.
""There will be increased focus on these areas as part of our wider supervision of firms over the next two years.""
Mark Turner, managing director of compliance at financial services firm Duff & Phelps, said it was clear the FCA wanted advisers to take action immediately.
""This is a far-reaching letter...reminding them of the important role they play in advising consumers on arguably the most important and significant financial decisions of their lives,"" Turner said.
The FCA said it would review initial and ongoing advice to consumers on taking an income in retirement.
""You need to ensure the advice you provide is suitable, costs and charges are disclosed clearly, and you act in the best interests of your clients,"" Gupta said.
Consumers in Britain have been given ""freedoms"" to cash in their pensions.
Lawmakers have said the FCA was too slow in 2017 in stopping steelworkers in Wales being ripped off by advisers over critical pension decisions.
""Consumer protection at and in retirement continues to be a significant challenge for the FCA in the post-pension freedom world,"" said Tom McPhail, head of policy at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), a funds supermarket.

It said that some financial advisers have inadequate resources and professional indemnity insurance, meaning they may not be able to compensate customers when things go wrong.

The 15-second ad, which has been running on television for the past three weeks and is also posted on KFC Australia's YouTube channel, shows a woman dressed in a short playsuit check her bottom and adjust her breasts as she looks at her reflection in the window of a parked car.
The car's window then rolls down to show two young boys staring at the woman's breasts, before she smiles and says, ""Did someone say KFC?""
The Zinger Popcorn box ad has so far garnered over 60,000 views with over 160 dislikes and 700 likes on YouTube.
""We apologize if anyone was offended by our latest commercial. Our intention was not to stereotype women and young boys in a negative light,"" a spokesperson for Yum Brands-owned (N:YUM) KFC's South Pacific unit said.
While many viewers did not approve of the ad, some took to Twitter to label the ad ""funny"" and said there was no need for the company to apologize.
Collective Shout, a group which campaigns against the objectification of women, condemned the ad and said https://www.collectiveshout.org/kfc_serves_up_buckets_of_sexism?recruiter_id=30544 it was a ""regression to tired and archaic stereotypes where young women are sexually objectified for male pleasure.""

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will pump the proceeds from last month's listing of oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) into the local economy over several years, including building up the domestic defense industry amid tensions with Iran, its finance minister said on Tuesday.
Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters there were ""serious efforts"" to reduce antagonism between Washington and Tehran after a top Iranian general was killed in a U.S. air strike and Iran retaliated with missile attacks against American bases in Iraq.
""If you look at history, we in this region have managed to weather through worse geopolitical situations, including actual, real wars,"" he said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.
""We in Saudi have to focus on the economy and reform ... We firmly believe the disputes can only be resolved by dialogue.""
A string of attacks last year on tankers in Gulf waters and Saudi oil sites, including the world's largest oil processing facility, pierced Saudi defenses and threatened to derail a reform agenda aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil.
Riyadh and Washington blame the strikes on Iran, which denies involvement but has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz shipping channel in retaliation for sanctions placed on its crude exports by Western powers.
The United States is sending additional military forces to Saudi Arabia, and France has deployed a radar system to bolster the kingdom's air defenses.
Even before the recent tensions, Riyadh had begun a drive to localize 50% of military spending led by Saudi Arabian Military Industries, owned by the state Public Investment Fund (PIF).
With nearly $30 billion coming into PIF coffers from Aramco's local share offering last month, new and existing local industries, including defense and technology, will get a boost in capital, Jadaan said.
""We work with our military industry to develop our own military assets in the mid-term to deal with these risks, including investment by PIF,"" he added.
HEALTHIER OIL PRICES
The Saudi economy, the largest in the Arab world, remains dominated by hydrocarbon revenues despite plans to diversify. It has suffered in recent years because of low oil prices and austerity measures aimed at reducing a huge budget deficit.
Jadaan said he expected to see healthier oil prices in 2020 due to solid demand, reduced output and easing trade tensions.
He also predicted a smaller deficit by the end of the year than announced last month, when Riyadh said it could face a deficit of nearly $50 billion this year.
Yet the International Monetary Fund on Monday lowered its forecast for Saudi Arabia’s economic growth to 1.9% this year due to output cuts agreed last month with the OPEC+ group of oil producers. Saudi Arabia has said it expects growth of 2.3%.
""Our focus is firmly on non-oil GDP growth, with focus on tourism, entertainment, sports, technology and financial sector,"" Jadaan said.
He said the presidency of the Group of 20 major economies, which Saudi Arabia assumed this year, was an important step towards resolving the region's problems.
""It is critical the world's attention is brought to the Middle East,"" said Jadaan. ""If you deal with some of the regional problems, it will be a relief for the world."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Asset manager Cordiant Capital is looking to raise around $350 million for a telecoms infrastructure equity fund and has hired two veteran dealmakers as it looks to benefit from strong growth in mobile data usage.
Canadian-based Cordiant is speaking to potential anchor investors for the fund, Cordiant IX, co-Chief Executive Benn Mikula told Reuters. He added that he expected some investors in the fund to commit an additional $350 million, alongside the fund but not in it, in the form of co-investments in the same telecoms infrastructure.
The fund will aim to capitalize on the increasing global need for new infrastructure as 5G technology prompts a worldwide increase in mobile data consumption and telecoms operators seek to share the cost.
""The carriers are finding that the cost of maintaining the client relationship, spending on their core networks and the client experience, whilst also investing in the plumbing and infrastructure of their network is extraordinarily expensive,"" Mikula said.
The new technology typically required more towers to be built to ensure wireless coverage, more fiber connections and more data centres, with Europe lagging other regions in rolling it out, added Steven Marshall, Cordiant's chairman of telecoms.
Among recent activity,  Cellnex Telecom  (MC:CLNX) agreed to buy Portuguese tower operator OMTEL, while  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) and  Vodafone  (L:VOD) are expected to kick off a sale of a stake in their Italian towers business.
Cordiant's fund would be the sixth biggest of 11 telecoms-focused funds currently in the global market raising money, data from industry tracker Preqin showed. The biggest is Melody Communications Infrastructure Fund II, seeking $1.5 billion.
""Our pipeline is sufficiently robust that we could deploy all of that capital out of the gate,"" Mikula said.
Cordiant was founded in Montreal in 1999 with backing from the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and launched four funds before being bought in 2015 by Mikula and partner Jean-Francois Sauve.
Since then, it has launched several further funds focused on infrastructure and other physical assets including Cordiant VIII, which is still raising money to invest in Brazil's agriculture industry.
Total capital deployed since the takeover is around $2.1 billion, most of which came from institutional investors such as pension schemes and family wealth offices in Europe and the United States.
Ahead of the launch of the telecoms fund, Mikula said the firm had hired two new senior dealmakers, David Kippen and Hagai Shilo, both of whom previously worked at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), where Mikula ran the European technology and telecoms team.
Kippen, who will divide his time between Montreal and London, has completed more than 40 private equity and M&A deals with a combined value of more than $30 billion."

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) aims to add more plant-based food and drinks to its menu, make its packaging reusable and invest in better waste-management, CEO Kevin Johnson said on Tuesday, as part of the company's latest plan to become more environmentally friendly.
Starbucks - which sells sausage breakfast-sandwiches, chicken wraps and smoked salmon bagels with cream cheese - did not say by when it would start offering the plant-based items or shift from single-use cups and plastic. A spokeswoman told Reuters that the company is exploring meat alternatives for its breakfast menu, but declined comment on potential suppliers.
Over the past year, with the rise of companies like Beyond Meat (O:BYND) and Impossible Foods, ""plant-based"" has become a food industry buzzword and several major brands and restaurants have raced to offer such products. The plant-based meat category is expected to be worth $140 billion in the next decade, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
For now, the world's largest coffee chain has laid out targets for 2030 including halving landfill waste from stores, and carbon emissions from its direct operations and supply chain. These targets were informed by research from the World Wildlife Fund and sustainability consultant Quantis.
Starbucks, which uses about 6 billion cups a year at its more than 30,000 outlets, has failed in the past to meet some of its own environmental goals including making 25% of its cups reusable by 2015. The target was revised to serving 5% of its beverages in personal tumblers by 2015, which Starbucks also missed. The Seattle-based company's abundant use of containers, lids and straws has been criticized by consumers as well as activist groups for decades. To be sure, some of its goals have been met, such as a 2008 plan to buy enough renewable energy certificates to power all of its company-operated stores by 2015."

86,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 09:02AM ET</span>",Microsoft CEO Fears U.S.-China Mistrust Will Hurt Global Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up here to receive the Davos Diary, a special daily newsletter that will run from Jan. 20-24.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Corp’s chief executive officer said he worries that mistrust between the U.S. and China will increase technology costs and hurt economic growth at a critical time.
Using the $470 billion semiconductor industry as an example of a sector that is already globally interconnected, Satya Nadella said the two countries will have to find ways to work together, rather than creating different supply chains for each country.
“All you are doing is increasing transaction costs for everybody if you completely separate,” Nadella said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at Bloomberg’s The Year Ahead conference in Davos. That’s a concern as the executive said the world is on the cusp of a revolution around technology and artificial intelligence.
“If we take steps back in trust or increase transaction costs around technology, all we are doing is sacrificing global economic growth,” he said.
The Trump administration is considering steps to further limit the ability of U.S. companies to supply Huawei Technologies Co., China’s flagship tech company, in addition to pressuring countries around the world to avoid using its equipment for 5G mobile networks.
The agreement signed last week between the U.S. and China was “not sufficient,” said Nadella, but represented “progress” on the issue of intellectual property protections for U.S. technology companies working with China.
Two Internets
Nadella said he worries about the development of two separate internets, noting that to some degree they already exist “and they will get amplified in the future” with massive technology companies already in place in China.
The viewpoint clashes with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who has been skeptical about the idea that ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions could ever lead to a bifurcated system of two internets.
China and the U.S. are the two leading AI superpowers, however the cooling political relations between them have slowed the international collaboration.
Nadella also warned that countries that fail to attract immigrants will lose out as the global tech industry continues to grow. The CEO has previously voiced concern about India’s Citizenship Amendment Act, which bans undocumented Muslim migrants from neighboring countries from seeking citizenship in India while allowing immigrants from other religions to do so, calling it “sad.”
“Every country is rethinking what is in their national interest,” he said. Governments need to “maintain that modicum of enlightenment and not think about it very narrowly,” Nadella said, adding that “people will only come when people know you’re an immigrant friendly country.“
However, Nadella said he remained hopeful. “I’m an India optimist,” he said. “The fact that there is a 70-year history of nation building, I think it’s a very strong foundation. I grew up in that country. I’m proud of that heritage. I’m influenced by that experience.”
Carbon Issues
Microsoft has recently unveiled plans to invest $1 billion to back companies and organizations working on technologies to remove or reduce carbon from the atmosphere, saying efforts to merely emit less carbon aren’t enough to prevent catastrophic climate change.
“We will now have to make sure all our data center operations are first consuming renewable energy,” Nadella said.
Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., along with other technology companies, have been criticized for supplying software and cloud services to large oil and gas companies like  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and  BP  (LON:BP) Plc. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s Larry Fink has been trailed to work and public engagements by protesters decrying the investment firm for inaction on global warming and other issues.
Activists have been pushing for companies to stop working with the largest produces of greenhouse gases. BlackRock has said will cut exposure to thermal coal as the world’s largest asset manager moves to address climate change.
Nadella declined to comment on whether Microsoft would stop working with the major carbon producers. “The energy transition is going to include all of us,” he said."

89,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 07:52AM ET</span>",Uber cuts losses from Eats business in India with sale to Zomato,"By Chandini Monnappa and Nivedita Bhattacharjee
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Uber (N:UBER) has sold its loss-making online food-ordering business in India to local rival Zomato in exchange for a 9.99% stake in the startup backed by China's Ant Financial.
Zomato, valued at around $3 billion after raising money from Ant this month, will take over Uber Eats' operations from Tuesday. 
Since launching in India in 2017, Uber Eats has struggled to gain market share and is a distant third to Tencent Holdings (HK:0700)-backed Swiggy and Zomato. 
All three have spent heavily on deals and discounts to attract customers in a highly competitive market.
Uber chief financial officer Nelson Chai said the move was another demonstration, following its decision to exit Uber Eats South Korea in October 2019, ""of our commitment to take a hard look at Eats markets where we do not have a path to leadership"".
The San Francisco-based firm, which has promised to be profitable at an operational level by the end of 2021, has been trying to sell the India Eats business for a year, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters. 
It earlier held talks with Swiggy for a similar deal, but those fell through due to valuation and regulatory issues, two of them said. Uber and Swiggy did not respond to requests for comment.
Uber Eats' India operations contributed just 3% of gross bookings for the business globally in the first nine months of last year, while accounting for a quarter of its adjusted operating losses, the company said.
The unit in India made a loss of $61 million for the three months to Sept. 30 on revenue of $20 million, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Zomato reported a loss of $294 million for the year to March 2019, while Swiggy made a loss of $330 million.
The sale will allow Uber to cut its losses and yet keep a stake in a market expected to be worth $15 billion by 2023.
Independent brand consultant Harish Bijoor said the deal would also allow Uber to focus on its strengths. ""It should stick to what its competence is, in terms of being an aggregator of cabs,"" he said. 
Zomato's orders per month should rise by 10 million from the 38 million to 40 million it was clocking before the deal, a source familiar with the deal said. Swiggy too receives around 40 million in monthly orders. 
The acquisition does not guarantee that all Uber Eats customers will switch to Zomato. Online food delivery customers tend to favor companies offering the best deals, market research shows.
Consultancy Frost and Sullivan said that even after the acquisition, Swiggy remains arguably the country's leading market player. 

""Swiggy’s diversification into a variety of last-mile delivery services, including store, package and home meal deliveries, is expected to offset any potential losses due to Zomato's acquisition of Uber Eats,"" it said in a note.

LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will hire 1,000 people in London this year in roles such as product development and safety as it continues to grow its biggest engineering center outside the United States after Britain leaves the European Union.
Over half of the new jobs will be in technology, including software engineering and data science, Facebook's vice president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa Nicola Mendelsohn said in an interview.
Other roles will be in the ""community integrity"" team, which makes products to detect and remove harmful content from platforms like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.
Mendelsohn said London's appeal was not only in its technology ecosystem but also the strength of its creative industries.
She said that while Facebook's enthusiasm for London was undimmed, like other tech companies it wanted certainty about Brexit. 
""The Johnson government has been very clear about what that looks like, and so we will continue to invest here in London,"" she said.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Facebook's growth was ""great news"". ""We are committed to making the UK the safest place in the world to be online, alongside being one of the best places for technology companies to be based,"" he said.
Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg will announce the new jobs, which will take its total UK employees to more than 4,000, on Tuesday before traveling to the World Economic Forum in Davos with Mendelsohn, where they will meet global leaders, regulators and other business chiefs.
The company is trying to rebuild trust in its platforms after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, in which a British political consulting firm collected data from Facebook for voter profiling and targeting.
Nick Clegg, Facebook's public affairs chief and a former British politician, said on Monday that the company will do a better job of preventing bad actors from manipulating this year's U.S. presidential election than it did four years ago.
Mendelsohn said trust would take time to rebuild. 
""We also understand that this is an ongoing important conversation - we want to be part of that conversation,"" she said. ""We want to be working with policymakers in this area to get to thoughtful policy.""
Facebook has commissioned research to show the economic benefits its platforms bring to businesses in Europe.
The study by Copenhagen Economics, which questioned 7,7320 businesses across 15 countries, estimated Facebook apps helped create 208 billion euros ($230 billion) of economic value last year.

""When you extrapolate that further, what you see is that has resulted in 3.1 million jobs in Europe as a result of people utilizing our platforms,"" Mendelsohn said.

97,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 05:19AM ET</span>","StockBeat: UBS Cuts Its Targets, Eyeing Another Year of Low Rates","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- For most of the last few years, UBS Group (SIX:UBSG) has been one of the few European banks that could be relied upon to pay its way in a world of cripplingly low interest rates. But even that seems less certain after the Swiss giant’s latest quarterly update.
The investment case for UBS has long been that its reliance on managing the wealth of the world’s ultra-rich makes it immune to cycles in parts of the banking industry reserved for mere mortals such as lending, investment funds and even (gasp) investment banking. But with performance at the investment bank and the core lending business faltering, that's becoming a tougher ask - as the bank acknowledged on Tuesday with a new, lower set of medium-term targets.
UBS stock fell 5.1%, the most of any bank in Europe on Tuesday, to their lowest in over a month. The benchmark Stoxx 600 lost 0.7% to 421.02, while the Swiss SMI index was actually the best performing across the continent with a loss of only 0.3%. That often happens on down days in Europe, given the heavy weighting of defensive stalwarts such as Nestle, Roche and Novartis. Elsewhere, the German DAX fell 0.5% and the FTSE 100 fell 1.2%, as sterling rebounded on stronger-than-expected labor market data.
UBS's profit before tax fell 7% in 2019, and the bank missed most of its targets from operating costs to profitability. Return on core equity fell to 12.4%, missing its target of 15% by a wide margin. The bank announced a new target range of 12%-15%. Conspicuously, it made no mention of any further share buybacks once its current program is completed.
Of course, even a 12% return on equity is something that the likes of Germany’s big banks can only dream of. And the crucial wealth management division did manage to eke out a further 4% gain in pretax profit for the year overall, while the more mundane asset management business posted an even stronger 17% increase.
However, the group’s investment bank saw profit fall 37%, not least due to another $110 million charge in the fourth quarter against goodwill that reflects the fading power of the brand in investment banking.
UBS tried to put a brave face on the coming year, saying that “clients are more active, which should lead to an improvement in transaction-related revenues,” and adding that higher asset prices should boost the commissions it gets on managing all those multi-billion-dollar fortunes.
But it still struck a note of foreboding with regard to the year ahead, specifically noting that “low and persistently negative interest rates and expectations of continuing easy monetary policy will continue to provide some headwinds to net interest income.” That update comes against a background of increased speculation that the Swiss National Bank will take fresh action to stop the franc rising any further against the euro and dollar.

Japan is one of the world's biggest consumers of seafood. While its consumers are known for paying a premium for high-quality food products, and for setting global food trends, Japan has lagged behind Europe and the United States in adopting policies on traceability and sustainable fisheries.
""I would say awareness has really improved in recent years,"" Kinzou Matsumoto, general manager in charge of Aeon's seafood merchandising planning, said on Tuesday as the company unveiled an expansion of its eco-certified lineup of seafood to include oysters approved by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC).
""Right now, certified items make up around 15% of our entire seafood products. Ideally we want to bring it to around 20%,"" he said, adding that it would soon have enough types of certified fish to assemble assorted sushi packs.
""We want to sell certified sushi to visitors coming to the Olympics, too... and that would have to be by June.""
The MSC said Aeon's scale would help expand recognition for sustainable seafood among Japanese consumers, and encourage fisheries.
""A commitment from Aeon is critical in driving change,"" said MSC's Asia-Pacific regional director Patrick Caleo. 
Japanese businesses including beer makers and hotels are making preparations to cater for record numbers of foreign visitors to Japan this summer as Tokyo hosts the Olympic Summer Games beginning in late July.
Kura Sushi (T:2695), among Japan's largest conveyer belt sushi chains, is opening its biggest branch this week - a store with 272 seats expected to draw 2,000 customers a day.
It forecasts that the number of foreigners visiting its restaurants in Tokyo to rise by about a third compared to a usual year.
Kura Sushi President Kunihiko Tanaka also defended the safety of seafood in Japan, including those from Fukushima, the site of the 2011 nuclear disaster.
Government data shows Fukushima seafood is ""absolutely"" safe, Tanaka said, adding that Kura Sushi planned to open a restaurant in Fukushima. 

South Korea's Olympic committee said in December that it plans to buy radiation detectors and ship homegrown ingredients to Japan for its athletes because of its concerns over food.

Investing.com - European stock markets slumped Tuesday, amid worries over a new pneumonia-like virus in China and the impact this could have on global growth.
At 04:15 ET (0910 GMT), the DAX traded 69 points, or 0.5% lower. France's CAC 40 was down 58 points, or 1%, while the FTSE 100 in the U.K. dropped 84 points, or 1.1%, weighed by disappointing corporate news. The pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50 fell 30 points, or 0.8%.
The outbreak of the disease, which has spread from the central city of Wuhan, is still in its early stages. However, there have been four confirmed deaths and it comes right before the peak travel season during the Lunar New Year holidays, raising risks that it could spread further. 
This all prompts fears of a repeat of the 2002 SARS pandemic. On that occasion more than 8,000 people across 37 countries were affected, with around 800 deaths. A 2003 academic study estimated the global economic cost at close to $40 billion.
In corporate news, shares in UBS (NYSE:UBS) dropped 5% after the Swiss banking giant missed its full-year profitability and cost targets and cut its mid-term goals. Rivals HSBC and   Standard Chartered   (LON:STAN) are also both over 2% down given their strong links to the Asian markets.
National European airlines are lower amid fears travel to Asia will be hit hard. Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) was hit hardest, down 2.2%, while Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) dropped 1.7%. However, low-cost airlines pushed higher, helped by strong revenue news from EasyJet (LON:EZJ) in the first quarter. Its shares climbed 4.9%.
The luxury sector has also been hard hit, amid worries the traditional demand seen from Asia will be hit by the health outbreak. The exception was,   Hugo Boss   (DE:BOSSn) which rose over 4% after its first positive update in a year. Last year was tricky for the German fashion house so this report may prove to be an inflection point. 
Elsewhere, U.S. President Donald Trump is set to deliver a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, while economic releases mainly consist of U.K. employment numbers at 4:30 AM ET (0930 GMT) and the German ZEW Economic Sentiment release at 5:00 AM ET (1000 GMT),

The companies, which also include  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690) and Qunar.com, said in separate but similar statements that the policy would be extended to users who had been put under quarantined or diagnosed with the new coronavirus.
As of Tuesday, nearly 300 people had been diagnosed globally, with all but a handful in China, and most of them in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. This has sent jitters among travelers as hundreds of millions of Chinese are prepare to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday this week.
The holiday is traditionally a high season for tourism and retail industries in China and overseas, but confirmation from health authorities that the virus spreads through human contact and calls for heightened vigilance is prompting concerns that many will opt to stay home during the week-long holiday.
The travel booking platforms said that Chinese civil aviation and railway authorities had still to set a special cancellation policy, but that they would try to meet the needs of customers wanting to cancel their trips.
Some travelers told Reuters that they were not taking any chances.
Zhang Xinyuan had been bound for the Thai resort island of Phuket before she and her husband decided to cancel their air tickets on Monday.
""Three of our friends canceled their trips too. We'll stay at home during the holiday. I'm scared as I remember SARS very well,"" she said, referring to the 2002/2003 spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus which broke out in China and killed nearly 800 people globally.
Another would-be traveler who works in the northern city of Shijiazhuang and only wanted to be known by her surname Zhao, told Reuters that she canceled her holiday plans in the southern province of Guangdong at a cost of 400 yuan ($57.90).
""The high-speed train from Shijiazhuang to Guangzhou has to change at Wuhan, and need to wait in Wuhan for 42 minutes. I can’t take the risk,"" she said.
Shares in hotel operators, leisure and entertainment companies, airliners and restaurant operators have plunged in recent days on concerns that these jitters will spread more widely. Analysts say they expect drugmakers, online shopping platforms and delivery firms to benefit should more people stay at home.
At least nine Chinese airlines have issued policies allowing travelers that had been quarantined or diagnosed with the virus to reschedule or cancel their flights for free, the Beijing Daily reported."

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares took a beating on Tuesday, wiping out all gains made at the start of the week as mounting concerns about a new strain of coronavirus in China sent a ripple of risk aversion through markets.
Authorities in China confirmed that a new virus could be spread through human contact, reporting 15 medical staff had been infected and a fourth person had died.
Safe-haven bonds and the yen gained as investors were reminded of the economic damage done by the SARS virus in 2002-2003, particularly given the threat of contagion as hundreds of millions travel for the Lunar New Year holidays.
""I'm not an expert in the pandemics, but you can look at previous examples like the SARS outbreak which also originated from Asia,"" said Cristian Maggio, Head of Emerging Markets Strategy at TD Securities in London.
Noting that China had initially downplayed the full extent of the SARS outbreak, he said ""I think the market might be fearing something similar."" 
The mood swing saw MSCI's All-Country World Index slip 0.4%, wiping out gains made at the start of the week on Monday. Asian markets were hit particularly hard.
Hong Kong, which suffered badly during the SARS outbreak, saw its index fall 2.8%.
Japan's Nikkei lost 0.9% and Shanghai blue chips 1.7%, with airlines under pressure. The caution spread to E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 which eased 0.5%.
The chill in Asia carried over to European markets, where shares of luxury goods makers - which have large exposure to China - were among the biggest fallers. (EU)

Investors had already been guarded after the International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts, mostly due to a surprisingly sharp slowdown in India and other emerging markets.
There had been some relief as U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron seemed to have struck a truce over a proposed digital tax.
The two agreed to hold off on a potential tariffs war until the end of the year, a French diplomatic source said.
Trump is due to deliver a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos later on Tuesday, and trade and tariffs could be on the agenda.

As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its short-term interest rate target at -0.1% and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around 0%, by a 7-2 vote.
Japan's yen picked up a bid on the safe-haven move and the dollar dipped to 109.93 from an early 110.17. It also gained on the euro, leaving the single currency lower to the dollar at $1.1090.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was steady at 97.638, just off a four-week high of 97.729.
The Australian dollar took a knock from the flu worries since it attracts large numbers of Chinese tourists, who tend to be big spenders over the Lunar New Year holidays.
Australia said it would step up screening of some flights from Wuhan.
The outbreak was particularly badly timed as the tourism industry has been mauled already by bushfires sweeping the country.

The State-owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) said as of now Beijing-controlled state companies can only use financial and commodities derivatives to hedge risks, and banned any form of speculative activities.
Industry players say the new ruling aims to rein in speculative trading activity and avoid losses, adding they do not see a significant impact on how state-owned companies operate as they don't frequently execute many short-term trades. 
A Shanghai-based trader said that with metals trading, for example, most state companies would not hold many speculative positions. 
""Its futures trading department may make arbitrage positions, but overall, I don't see a big impact from this,"" said the trader, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media. 
""State companies dealing with non-ferrous metals like state-owned copper smelters are more compliant in terms of hedging and have less speculative positions,"" he added, citing Jiangxi Copper Co (SS:600362), one of China's biggest copper producers, and Yunnan Copper (SZ:000878) as examples. 
Both Jiangxi Copper and Yunnan Copper did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A trader at state-owned China Minmetals Corp, China's biggest metals trading firm, also told Reuters there would be no impact on the company because its derivatives management was already very strict.
SASAC said it is strengthening its rules after finding unidentified cases of mismanagement regarding overseas derivative trading. 
On its website, it said firms must set up an effective risk-management system, and report derivative trading activities to the regulator on a regular basis.
""Companies' derivative businesses have undergone new trends and new changes in recent years, the current regulatory mechanism may be outdated to meet the real demands,"" the regulator said.
Under the new rules, SASAC caps hedging volumes at 90% of companies' annual turnover of physical transactions and production. Hedging activities for trading purposes should not exceed 80% of the physical volumes under the new regulations.
State refiner Sinopec Corp (HK:0386) lost nearly $700 million in late 2018 in one of China's largest derivatives trading losses in nearly a decade.
Sinopec has not provided further details so far beyond suspending two senior officials and blaming ""inappropriate trading strategies"" in crude oil hedging. It didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the new SASAC rules.

KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Proposals to invest in ailing Malaysia Airlines include one from Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) which wants as much as 49% while Japan Airlines (T:9201) is looking at a 25% stake, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Domestic carrier AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA) and Malindo Air, the Malaysian arm of Indonesia's Lion Air, have also submitted proposals, the people added.
Malaysia's government has found the proposals from foreign airlines more attractive but the sovereign wealth fund that owns Malaysia Airlines favors a deal with AirAsia, one of the sources said.
""The bids from the foreign carriers are more comprehensive and strategic as both plan to capitalize on the strategic location of Malaysia for their operations,"" said the source.
The Malaysian government has been seeking a strategic partner for its national airline, which has struggled to recover from two tragedies in 2014 - the mysterious disappearance of flight MH370 and the shooting down of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine.
That year, it was taken private by sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd, which paid 1.4 billion ringgit ($345 million) for the 30% of shares it did not already own.
The sources declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential. Representatives for Air France-KLM, AirAsia and Malindo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Japan Airlines (JAL) said it was looking to expand its partnership with Malaysia Airlines through their joint venture but declined to comment on reports of a potential investment in the company.
The government has received five proposals as part of a review that started last year, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday, although he declined to name the suitors.
There is no official timeline for a deal, but one source has said the government wants to get an investor finalised this quarter.
MAHATHIR AND KHAZANAH AT ODDS
Malaysia Airlines last year signed a joint venture agreement with JAL covering flights between Malaysia and Japan, which the Japanese airline said could be expanded in the future to cover U.S. flights.
Malaysia Airlines and JAL are both members of the oneworld airline alliance, while Air France-KLM is part of the rival SkyTeam alliance.
Sources said Air France-KLM had proposed setting up a hub for maintenance, repair and overhaul services in Malaysia, while Japan Airlines had offered to make the Southeast Asian country its regional hub, including for low-cost flights.
""An international solution is probably better in this situation as AirAsia would have competition concerns,"" one of the sources said.
""This is still a work in progress but the story is around the potential for a massive hub in Southeast Asia and it's clear that international airlines see value in Malaysia Airlines because of this,"" the source said.
Business news website Focus Malaysia said on Monday, citing an official document, that Khazanah had been pushing for AirAsia to merge with Malaysia Airlines.
It also said AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes had proposed a three-way merger between the company, its long-haul unit AirAsia X (KL:AIRX) and Malaysia Airlines.
Khazanah, which appointed  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) last year to advise on potential options for the airline, said it was working closely with the government.
""While there have been several proposals in this regard, a review of the options available to us is still ongoing,"" it said in a statement.
But Mahathir, who is also chairman of the board at Khazanah, said he was ""not completely happy"" with the way the fund had been evaluating the proposals.
""Unfortunately, Khazanah has got its own agenda so I have to check them,"" he said."

Please refresh for updates for UK market news from the LSE’s RNS on individual UK shares from FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and FTSE All-Share.
Budget airline EasyJet (LON:EZJ) said its first-half loss will narrow this year after it raised its revenue guidance for the first half, thanks to higher passenger numbers and an increase in revenue per seat.
Lower capacity in competitors helped the airline boost passenger numbers during the quarter. The airline also said it benefited from the breakup of Thomas Cook in September.
The low-cost airline said revenue was up 9.9% to 1.4 billion pounds for the three months to Dec. 31, up from 1.3 billion pounds the previous year.

   BP    (LON:BP) said its chief financial officer Brian Gilvary is to retire. He’ll be succeeded by Murray Auchincloss, who is currently CFO of the group’s upstream division. Gilvary will stay on through a transition period lasting until the middle of the year.

Dixons Carphone (LON:DC) shares are set for an interesting open after the retailer reported a strong Christmas season for appliances but a miserable one for mobile phones.
Like-for-like sales in electricals rose 2% thanks to a 75% increase in supersized TVs and a 20% rise in the number of people buying fancy hairdryers and other beauty products from Dyson – a spending splurge somewhat at odds with the weak overall retail sales report for December.
But all that good work was undone by an 11% drop in the Carphone side of the business, as like-for-like sales in the U.K. and Ireland fell 9%.
Chief Executive Alex Baldock said the group had gained market share, and that online sales had risen 7% in the period. International online sales rose 5%. He cited “broad-based growth with strength in TVs, Gaming, Smart Tech and Small Domestic Appliances”.

Telecoms company Talk Talk (LON:TALK) said it would sell its fibre network, FibreNation, to CityFibre in a deal valued at 200 million pounds. 
The sale is conditional on shareholder approval.

Miners BHP Group (LON:BHPB) said its full year guidance remained unchanged, despite the ongoing bushfires in Australia.
BHP said it increased its production of copper and iron ore, however output of petroleum and coal dropped.
""Production and cost guidance is unchanged, and we remain on track to deliver slightly higher production than last year.” said CEO Mike Henry.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's troubled Baoshang Bank will be taken over by local governments and a group of state firms, a central bank official with direct knowledge of the matter said, as Beijing looks to shore up some of the country's weakest lenders.
Financial regulators took control of Inner Mongolia-based Baoshang Bank last May, citing serious credit risks. That takeover rattled domestic markets, pushing up interbank funding costs for some smaller lenders and prompting the central bank to inject cash into the banking system to prevent contagion risks.
The governments of China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Baotou, a major city in the region, will lead the acquisition of at least a 50% stake in a reorganized Baoshang Bank, according to the official, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.
State firms in Inner Mongolia will also participate in the takeover, the official said.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in November that asset and cap­i­tal ver­i­fi­ca­tion work at Baoshang was nearly complete, and that it would restructure the lender as soon as possible.
Other strategic investors in the revamped Baoshang Bank include  Huishang Bank  (HK:3698), China Construction Bank (CCB) (HK:0939) (SS:601939) and a national deposit insurance fund managed by the central bank, the official said.
The official did not elaborate on the value of the investment or specific shareholding details.
Reuters reported earlier this month that Huishang Bank planned to take over four branches of Baoshang under a state-led reorganization.
Huishang also said recently that it plans to invest up to 3.6 billion yuan ($524.29 million) to hold up to 15% of a newly created provincial commercial bank, without naming the lender, although the sources said at the time that the investment was linked to the Baoshang reorganization.

The Inner Mongolia and Baotou governments could not be reached for comment. Baoshang and Huishang declined to comment. CCB didn't reply to a Reuters request for comment.

At 02:00 ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 110 points, or 0.8%, lower. France's CAC 40 futures were down 45 points, or 0.8%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. also dropped 46 points, or 0.6%. Futures on the pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50, fell 24 points, or 0.6%.
With Wall Street closed Monday, European traders looked to Asia for early guidance Tuesday. The news there was not positive as the spread of a pneumonia-like virus in China prompted fears of a repeat of the 2002 SARS pandemic. On that occasion more than 8,000 people across 37 countries were affected, with at least 774 deaths.
The outbreak of the disease, which has spread from the central city of Wuhan, is still in its early stages, but has resulted in four confirmed deaths so far.
Hong Kong, which suffered badly during the SARS outbreak and also Tuesday had its credit rating downgraded by Moody’s, saw its index fall 2.7%. Japan's Nikkei lost 1% and Shanghai blue chips 1.5%. The news had on Monday also affected European luxury goods makers, for whom Hong Kong contributes a large proportion of sales.
Still in Asia, the Bank of Japan left its official interest rates unchanged Tuesday and painted a brighter picture of the economic outlook. This had been widely expected following Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s $120 billion economic package unveiled last month, and comes ahead of meetings by the European Central Bank later this week and the Federal Reserve next week.
Attention in Europe will focus on the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where U.S. President Donald Trump is due to deliver a speech later Tuesday. Trade and tariffs could be on the agenda following a report that the U.S. and France have struck a truce over France's proposed digital tax, agreeing to hold off from a potential tariff war until the end of the year.
In corporate news, airlines are likely to be in focus given the worries over the virus in China and the impact this could have on travel. More specifically, Air France KLM SA (PA:AIRF) will be in the spotlight following a report that it seeks to invest in the ailing Malaysia Airlines.
The Malaysian government has been seeking a strategic partner for its national airline, which has struggled to recover from two tragedies - the mysterious disappearance of flight MH370 and the shooting down of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine.

115,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 11:23PM ET</span>","Hong Kong Stocks Drop Most in Asia on Moody’s, Virus Concern","(Bloomberg) -- A deadly virus in China. A rating downgrade from Moody’s Investors Service. Violent clashes over the weekend.
Welcome to Hong Kong, where reasons to sell stocks are mounting ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. The MSCI Hong Kong Index slumped as much as 2.3% Tuesday, lagging other benchmarks in Asia. Many property firms were among the biggest decliners, along with casino operators in nearby Macau.
Hong Kong stocks had been among the world’s best performers since early December, helped by mainland investors, gains in the local currency and an initial trade deal between the U.S. and China. But the benchmark Hang Seng Index stalled at the 29,000 point level last week, and there’s been a surge in stock sales this month, which has previously foreshadowed near-term market tops.
“Investors would want to cash out before the holiday because there is so much bad news,” said Jackson Wong, asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd. “It is uncertain how the virus outbreak will develop in China during the holidays. We are holding more cash and we are avoiding travel-related stocks and some technology stocks that had already jumped a lot earlier.”
Stock indexes were down more than 1% in China, outpacing declines elsewhere in Asia, while Asian currencies were widely lower. The Chinese yuan weakened as much as 0.4% against the U.S. dollar, its biggest drop since September, after a run of big gains. China’s 10-year government-bond yield continued to fall, hitting a fresh four-month low Tuesday at 3.048%.
Wynn Macau Ltd. and Hang Lung Properties Ltd led declines on the MSCI Hong Kong gauge, falling at least 3.4% as of 11:26 a.m. China Life Insurance Co. was the biggest loser on the Hang Seng Index, dropping 4.3%.
“Most people have only very limited information about this virus, and its too early to tell how serious it is, so it makes sense for people to be defensive at this moment,” said Chi Man Wong, Hong Kong-based analyst at China Galaxy International Financial Holdings Ltd. He added the Moody’s downgrade likely isn’t having an impact regionally as the move was signaled by September’s reduction to Hong Kong’s ratings outlook. Since then, the city’s economy has slid into recession.
Moody’s said Monday that “the absence of tangible plans to address either the political or economic and social concerns of the Hong Kong population that have come to the fore in the past nine months may reflect weaker inherent institutional capacity than Moody’s had previously assessed.”
Potentially adding to the underperformance for Hong Kong stocks is Tuesday being the last day mainlanders can trade equities through trading links with the city before the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in China. Markets are closed for two days next week in Hong Kong, while stocks and bond trading in Taiwan has already stopped for the holiday. The inability to trade is prompting some investors to harvest some recent profit, analysts say.
Investors had been strongly bullish in much of the world since early December, helped by eased trade tensions and signs that global stimulus is likely to continue. Optimism in markets like China and Taiwan has been very strong of late, with heavy foreign inflows to both.
That could be shaken by new developments on the new virus originating in central China. Medical workers being infected signals it could be more easily transmitted than previously thought, raising concerns about a potential repeat of the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which killed almost 800 people.
How China’s Mystery Illness Is and Isn’t Like SARS: QuickTake
Hong Kong is on “extremely high alert” and preparing for human-to-human transmission, said Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung.
“There is a risk of an exponential outbreak of a SARS-like virus, so investors are choosing to be risk-off” ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, said Zhou Hao, a senior emerging markets economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG). Hundreds of millions of people travel in China during the period, sharply increasing the risk that the virus’ spread sharply accelerates."

In a statement, Moody’s noted that the strength in the Chinese-ruled city’s institutions and governance is “lower than previously estimated.”

However, the rating agency moved its outlook to stable from negative.
 
Hong Kong’s government issued a statement on Tuesday and said it strongly disagreed with Moody’s assessment and was “deeply disappointed” by the decision.
 
China’s Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component both dropped 1.0%. 
 
Concerns over China’s coronavirus were cited as headwinds for local stocks today, after reports suggested evidence of the virus’ contagiousness among humans. 
 
“As Chinese citizens travel home for the Lunar New Year, more cases of the new virus have been reported and it seems it is spreading,” said Zhou Hao, a senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank AG. “There is a risk of an exponential outbreak” along the lines of the 2003 SARS virus, Zhou said.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 09:51PM ET</span>",Japan activist investor Murakami makes hostile bid for ex-Toshiba unit,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - A fund backed by Japan's most prominent activist investor said it will launch on Tuesday an up to $235 million takeover bid for  Toshiba Machine Co Ltd  (T:6104), even though the former Toshiba Corp (T:6502) unit has threatened to implement defense measures.
Hostile bids are rare in Japan but have been increasing as the government promotes corporate governance reform to make management more accountable to investors.
City Index Eleventh Co, backed by veteran activist investor Yoshiaki Murakami, said it would offer 3,456 yen per Toshiba Machine share to buy up to 43.82% of the molding machine maker, spending up to 25.9 billion yen ($235 million).
The offer price represents an 11% premium over Toshiba Machine's close on Friday, when the company revealed the Murakami fund group's buyout plans. The shares plunged 9% on Tuesday after shooting up 19% on Monday.
Toshiba Machine late on Friday said it could adopt poison-pill measures to fend off acquisition attempts by diluting the holdings of unwanted suitors.
It added that the planned takeover bid could potentially hurt the maximization of its corporate value and shareholders' interests.
A Toshiba Machine spokesman said on Tuesday the firm is examining the tender offer.
City Index Eleventh in a statement said poison pill measures would buck corporate governance progress in Japan and have a significantly negative impact on market participants.
Murakami-related funds currently hold a combined 11.49% of Toshiba Machine's total voting rights.
A former bureaucrat, Murakami famously led a fund targeting Japanese companies and pushing for greater shareholder returns until he was convicted of insider trading in 2007. He has since resurfaced as an investor, working with his daughter.
Toshiba Corp holds less than 3% of Toshiba Machine, having sold the bulk of its stake during a management crisis in 2017."

The agency, however, moved its outlook to stable from negative.
""The absence of tangible plans to address either the political or economic and social concerns of the Hong Kong population that have come to the fore in the past nine months may reflect weaker inherent institutional capacity than Moody's had previously assessed,"" the agency said in a statement.
The agency also said that there has been a lack of clarity from Hong Kong's government on its response to the direct council elections late last year that saw pro-democracy candidates win by record numbers.
""Pressures on Hong Kong's institutions undermine its credit profile directly,"" Moody's added.
In a statement on Tuesday, Hong Kong's government said it strongly disagreed with Moody's assessment and was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision.
""Although Hong Kong has faced the most severe social unrest since its return to the Motherland in the past seven months or so, the HKSAR Government, with the staunch support of the Central Government, has firmly upheld the 'one country, two systems' principle and handled the situation in accordance with the law to curb violence on its own to restore social order as soon as possible,"" it said.
Moody's said its stable outlook reflects Hong Kong's superior fiscal strength and consistent macroeconomic stability.
The agency's move comes as many Hong Kongers continue to take to the streets, with thousands gathering in a central park on Sunday calling for democratic reforms leading to clashes with the police.
Protests escalated in June over a since-withdrawn bill which would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party. They have since broadened to several demands, including universal suffrage.
Moody's called the response by Hong Kong's government to political demands by parts of the population and concerns about living standards, housing costs and equality of economic opportunities to be ""notably slow, tentative and inconclusive.""
The government said it was ""proactively"" engaging various groups of people through dialogue.
""The persistent social unrest reflects that there are deep-seated problems in society in Hong Kong, on which the Government will conduct an independent review soon,"" the government statement said.
In September, Fitch downgraded Hong Kong's rating to ""AA"" from ""AA+""."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea carrier Air Niugini has updated its contract with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to delay the delivery of its four 737 MAX jets on order until at least 2024, the airline's chief executive said on Tuesday.
The carrier had been due to receive its first 737 MAX this year.
Air Niugini Chief Executive Alan Milne told Reuters the delay would give the airline more time to complete a broader review of its fleet plans, including a replacement for its smaller Fokker jets.
""This will then determine if the MAX is still appropriate for Air Niugini, or whether another Boeing product would better suit as a replacement for the 737/767,"" he said, in reference to older models in the airline's fleet.
Milne said it was possible the 737 MAX orders could be switched to the smaller Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) E2 family if Boeing's deal to buy the bulk of the Brazilian planemaker's commercial division closes.
""Air Niugini is a valued Boeing customer and we are working closely with the airline to meet its evolving fleet requirements,"" a Boeing spokesman said. ""Unfortunately, we do not disclose ongoing customer discussions and have no further comment.""
Some other Boeing customers, including Malaysia Airlines,  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH) and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA's (OL:NWC) leasing arm have also postponed the delivery of 737 MAX jets since the model was grounded globally last March after two fatal crashes.
Boeing confirmed on Monday that it has temporarily halted production of the 737 MAX in Washington State in recent days. The company had said in December it would halt production at some point this month."

On Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it would review the petition and released a redacted version that said ""Tesla vehicles experience unintended acceleration at rates far exceeding other cars on the roads.""
The petition urged the agency to recall all Tesla vehicles, the Model S, Model X and Model 3, produced beginning in 2013. It cited media reports of crashes attributed to unintended acceleration and complaints filed with NHTSA.
Tesla said the petition was ""completely false"" and was brought forward by a short-seller.
Brian Sparks, who is currently shorting Tesla stock, according to CNBC, submitted the petition https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INBC-DP20001-3494.pdf in September.
""Over the past several years, we discussed with NHTSA the majority of the complaints alleged in the petition. In every case we reviewed with them, the data proved the vehicle functioned properly,"" Tesla said in a blog post https://www.tesla.com/blog/no-unintended-acceleration-tesla-vehicles.

The Revolutionary Confederation of Laborers and Farmworkers, or CROC, is pressing for a 20% pay raise, benefits such as 20 annual vacation days and more contributions toward transportation, school supplies, food and savings funds.
Home Depot has about 6,200 workers under the union's contracts, according to CROC, out of a total of 16,000 Home Depot employees across 125 stores in Mexico.
The negotiation process is being overseen by local labor councils, said CROC spokesman Eduardo Miranda.
""If there is no agreement between the parties, they establish a day and time to launch the strike,"" he said.
The demands for Home Depot, where CROC has 40 collective contracts in 18 Mexican states, in part grew out of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which includes strict labor protections.
The trade pact was approved by the U.S. Senate last week, and will now go to President Donald Trump for him to sign into law.
Home Depot did not immediately reply to a request for comment. It previously told Reuters it was committed to complying with the law."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is in talks with banks about borrowing $10 billion or more amid rising costs for the U.S. planemaker after two crashes involving its 737 MAX jetliner, a source told Reuters on Monday.
CNBC first reported the news on Monday, citing sources that Boeing has so far secured at least $6 billion from banks and is talking to other lenders for more contributions.
A source confirmed the talks to Reuters, but it was still not clear how much Boeing would seek to raise and whether it would pursue the selling of new bonds. One key issue for Boeing is flexibility since it is not clear how long the 737 MAX will remain grounded.
Boeing declined to comment.
Reuters reported on Friday that the Federal Aviation Administration is now unlikely to approve the plane’s return until March, but that could take until April or longer.
Boeing confirmed on Monday that it temporary halted production of the 737 MAX in Washington State in recent days. The company had said in December it would halt production at some point this month.
""MAX production has now been temporarily suspended inside the 737 factory. The Renton site remains open as our teams focus their work on several quality initiatives,"" Boeing said, referring to its facility in Renton, Washington.
Boeing does not get paid until it delivers the planes it manufactures.
The company has estimated the costs of the 737 MAX grounding at more than $9 billion to date, and is expected to disclose significant additional costs during its fourth-quarter earnings release on Jan. 29. Boeing faces rising costs from halting production of the plane this month, compensating airlines for lost flights and assisting its supply chain.
Analysts estimate that Boeing has been losing around $1 billion a month because of the grounding. It reported an almost $3 billion negative free cash flow in the third quarter.
Boeing also reported its worst annual net orders in decades last week, along with its lowest numbers for plane deliveries in 11 years.
On Friday, Boeing said it was addressing a new 737 MAX software issue discovered in Iowa during a technical review of the proposed update for the plane.
Last week,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (O:AAL) both said they would extend cancellations of 737 MAX flights until early June.
Also this month, the FAA and Boeing said they were reviewing a wiring issue that could potentially cause a short circuit on the 737 MAX."
123,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 03:36PM ET</span>",Avolon CEO says greener airlines should pay less to lease planes,"By Tim Hepher and Conor Humphries
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Airlines with the best environmental scores should pay less for leasing aircraft than more polluting competitors, the head of one of the world's top leasing companies said on Monday.
The radical proposal from Dublin-based Avolon comes as aviation firms face mounting scrutiny over climate policies not only from environmental groups but also investment funds that monitor Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance.
Avolon, one of the top three aircraft lessors, claims to have one of the industry's youngest and most efficient fleets.
""But that narrative is not good enough for the next 1, 2, 3 or 4 years,"" Chief Executive Domhnal Slattery warned.
""More and more of our major bond investors are keen to understand what our 'E' strategy is within 'ESG'. We in turn are keen to understand when underwriting our airline credits what their 'E' strategy is,"" he told Reuters.
Slattery predicted that lessors, which depend heavily on access to funds to run their capital-intensive businesses, would in future exert more pressure on airlines.
""You could see over time that airlines that have a better environmental score could get lower lease rates,"" he said.
""You could absolutely see that aircraft financiers like us that have a much better 'E' score from the investors' perspective get tighter priced bonds, so everybody is aligned.""
Avolon has not yet put the idea into practice but leasing industry officials say environmental scores or indices for airlines could be on the horizon.
Aviation accounts for 2-3% of greenhouse-gas emissions, and if left unchecked emissions are expected to rise as passengers and flights increase.
The industry appears divided on the issue, however.
Air Lease Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy, one of the founders of the leasing industry which finances half the world's passenger fleet, said aviation was being unfairly targeted by a ""politically driven"" climate agenda.
""The media and people who are so fixated on this issue have overblown the damage that the aviation industry is creating to the planet,"" he told the Airline Economics conference.
Economists say pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and others are showing greater care when investing in companies and have started limiting exposure to oil, gas and coal stocks.
Aviation has already halved carbon emissions per traveler, with more fuel-efficient aircraft, while many airlines are trumpeting carbon-offsetting schemes.
But activists say the industry must curb its growth plans to get a handle on the issue.
Several industry officials said aviation needs to improve how it defends itself, arguing that fuel efficiency has improved much faster in planes than in cars.
Aengus Kelly, CEO of no.1 lessor AerCap, said the International Air Transport Association, an airlines group which has taken the lead on the issue, may not have the funding to succeed and another body should possibly take over.
""One large U.S. airline was on a roadshow two weeks ago and in the roadshow of 60 minutes to pitch the bond deal, 20 minutes was on ESG. And there was real criticism of the airline for not having a section in their pitch book on ESG from one of the biggest bond investors in the world,"" he said.
""Its coming. We have to get on the front foot."""

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - More than half of chief executives in an annual survey by PwC expect a slowdown in global economic growth this year, in marked contrast to the confidence that has lifted stock markets.
The survey, published on Monday ahead of the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, found 53% of CEOs around the world forecast the rate of global growth will fall, compared with 29% the year before, the highest level of pessimism since the accounting firm began asking the question in 2012. 
Meanwhile shares of many major companies are hovering near record highs, amid a thawing in U.S.-China trade tensions. A recent  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) report said investors, betting on a bounce in global growth, now have the greatest exposure to equities in two years.
However, the 1,581 interviews with CEOs in 83 countries were carried out between September and October 2019, before China and the United Stated inked an initial deal resolving some of their trade disputes and other geopolitical risks, such as Britain abruptly exiting the European Union, subsided.
Only 27% of CEOs surveyed said they were ""very confident"" in their company's growth over the next 12 months – the lowest level PwC has seen since 2009, and down from 35% last year. 
Extrapolating from these results, PwC said global growth could slow to 2.4% in 2020.
""Given the lingering uncertainty over trade tensions, geopolitical issues and the lack of agreement on how to deal with climate change, the drop in confidence in economic growth is not surprising -- even if the scale of the change in mood is,"" said Bob Moritz, chairman of PwC's international network.
CEOs are also increasingly concerned about cyber threats and climate change, PwC said. More than two-thirds of the CEOs surveyed believe that governments will introduce new legislation to regulate social media content and break up dominant technology companies. 
While climate change does not rank among the top ten threats to CEOs' growth prospects, the survey found a strong desire among many business leaders to reduce their companies' carbon footprint. 

CEOs are now twice as likely to ""strongly agree"" that investing in climate change initiatives will boost reputational advantage, PwC said.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer (SA:EMBR3) is in the advanced stages of studying the launch of a new turboprop aircraft to be developed through a venture it is planning with Boeing, subject to necessary approvals, a top executive said on Monday.
The aircraft would be in the same size range or even larger than the 70-seat ATR-72, a Franco-Italian aircraft that currently dominates the market, Embraer Commercial Aviation Chief Executive John Slattery told Reuters.
""It sits in our target market, which we have always been clear is below 150 seats, and will have natural adjacency to the E2 offering,"" he said, referring to Embraer's family of 80-120-seat regional jets. ""The business case is going well.""
Analysts say such a move could shake up a market dominated by ATR, which controls four-fifths of global sales in competition with the Q400 turboprop, sold by Bombardier last year to Longview Aviation of Canada and renamed the De Havilland Canada DHC-8.
China is also targeting the market with its Xian MA700. Analysts say turboprops are more efficient than jetliners over short distances, especially when oil prices are high.
Speaking as the aviation industry poured into Dublin for annual Airline Economics and Airfinance Journal conferences, Slattery said he believed a move by Embraer into turboprops would force a response from ATR and boost choice for airlines.
He said ATR had a ""de facto monopoly"" because of recent marketing challenges facing its smaller Canadian rival.
ATR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
ENGINE DISCUSSIONS
ATR claims to be the world's most profitable aircraft manufacturer with double-digit margins, though it does not publish financial data separately from its co-shareholders, Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF).
It predicts demand for 2,390 deliveries of turboprop passenger aircraft with 61-80 seats over 20 year to 2037.
Embraer is also in ""meaningful"" discussions with engine makers  General Electric  (N:GE), Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and Pratt & Whitney Canada (N:UTX) about an engine for the new plane, Slattery said. Pratt is currently the sole turboprop supplier.
Any launch decision would need to be backed by Boeing.
Embraer is studying the plan as it tries to complete a 2018 agreement to fold its commercial aircraft activities into a venture to be controlled by Boeing (N:BA).
The deal has won approval from several regulators but the European Union has launched a detailed competition review.
Slattery said Embraer would not go ahead with the project on a standalone basis because of the cost - estimated at billions of dollars - and other priorities.
But he stressed there was no connection between the turboprop study and talks with regulators over the rest of Embraer's commercial airplane activities.
""The amount of balance sheet required for a new state-of-the-art commercial aircraft is of an order of magnitude that we simply don’t have the appetite for, outside of the joint-venture environment,"" Slattery said, adding, ""no JV, no TP"".
He added he did not expect any such hurdle to arise because Embraer remains confident the Boeing deal will be approved on its merits, citing the support of several purchasing airlines.
European Union regulators investigating the $4.2 billion tie-up have asked for more than 1.5 million pages of information and data on over 20 years of sales campaigns, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - New legislation will improve protection for foreign investors in India by offering relief from possible policy changes but will uphold the state's right to tax them, according to its draft and government documents seen by Reuters.
The bill also attempts to upgrade India's investment climate and boost foreign investment by setting up new adjudicating authorities to swiftly resolve disputes. It is part of India's efforts to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024, from around $2.7 trillion currently, the documents said.
But the draft text of the new law dated Nov. 15 does not cover demands related to enforcement of tax obligations, a critical area of concern for foreign investors.
Several firms including  IBM  (N:IBM), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and  Vodafone  (L:VOD) have collectively faced billions of dollars in tax claims from India's government in recent years, leading to arbitration cases and protracted legal battles in courts.
A separate internal government document which analyses the draft law noted that taxation issues were of ""great interest"" to investors and excluding it from the law's purview could reduce the proposal's intent to boost their comfort level.
Nevertheless, the document defended the exclusion, saying ""the power to tax is an integral part of the state's police powers even recognized in international law"".
The Finance Ministry, which drafted the law, did not respond to a request for comment.
Two sources familiar with deliberations on the law said it could still undergo several changes before it is finalised. The bill is likely to be presented for passage in the upcoming parliament session that starts Jan. 31, they said.
The bill proposes to cover a wide range of foreign investors, including investments from sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and insurance funds, the government document said.
""CREDIBLE COMMITMENT""
One of the most high-profile tax disputes has been India's tussle with Vodafone, which was asked to deposit capital against tax after its $11 billion deal to buy local assets of Hutchison Whampoa in 2007.
Though India's Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that Vodafone was not liable to any tax, the government later amended the law to enable it to tax such deals retroactively. Vodafone and India remain locked in international arbitration over the dispute.
While the draft law proposes to exclude disputes specific to taxation, it offers to provide ""credible commitment to investments"" by deterring policy changes, the draft said.
In December 2018, months after Walmart (N:WMT) paid $16 billion to acquire a majority of India's Flipkart, the government tweaked its foreign investment rules for e-commerce, forcing both Flipkart and Amazon (O:AMZN) to rework their business structures. The sudden policy change rattled foreign investors.
The draft law stipulates that any new policy or law changes that provide ""less favorable"" treatment should allow investors to continue enjoying benefits of the earlier policy.
""This clause will significantly improve predictability of investment regime and hence will be a significant boost to investments,"" read the government document analyzing the draft law. ""The investor will have an option of choosing between the new and old policies.""
It was not immediately clear whether protection against such sudden policy changes would be permanent or only for a particular period.
The proposal also seeks to address concerns about the slowness of India's legal system. It proposes setting up two new bodies to provide swift legal recourse: an Investment Ombudsman who will rule on disputes within 90 days, and an appellate Investment Tribunal which would rule within 180 days.
""(This) will eradicate the demand for an international arbitration process as the remedy would be quick, effective and available domestically,"" the government document stated.
India is entangled in more than 20 overseas arbitration cases - the most against any country - brought by companies including Vodafone and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201)."
131,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 12:11PM ET</span>","Wincrest, net short U.S. stocks, says lofty valuations dangerous","By Divya Chowdhury and Lisa Pauline Mattackal
(Reuters) - Emerging markets are the ""anti-bubble"" to increasingly expensive U.S. stocks, Barbara Ann Bernard, founder and chief investment officer of asset manager Wincrest Capital, said on Monday.
Lofty equity valuations of companies like Apple Inc (O:AAPL) were dangerous, Bernard, whose investments include Saudi Arabian gyms and Indian shoe maker  Relaxo Footwears Ltd  (NS:RLXO), said in an interview in the Reuters Global Markets Forum.
Although the trend toward passive investing threatens the process of price discovery, it creates opportunities for investors willing to bet on overlooked stocks, Bernard said on the eve of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.
Below are excerpts from the interview:
Question (Q) - Which countries do you find value in currently? Do emerging markets look appealing to you?
Answer (A) - Absolutely. Our fund is currently net short the U.S. market, not because we don't like the United States as a country, but rather, because we find twice the growth at half the multiple in Europe and emerging markets.
Last year, the earnings of the S&P 500 (SPX) were flat. Yet its price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) expanded from 14 times earnings to 19 times by year-end. People are paying more for less there today.
As value investors, we are interested in paying less for more and are agnostic as to where we look for that opportunity.
Q: What is your view on the FAANG group (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)) of stocks, and in general, on U.S. tech valuations?
A: Things can be popular or safe, but in my experience, they are rarely both. FAANG is popular, but it is expensive, which makes it dangerous.
Today, the emerging market consumer is the ""anti-bubble"" to FAANG. For the market cap of Apple, you can buy every company in the four largest southeast Asian economies.
It is not normal, nor rational, to believe one company has a brighter future than several countries combined.
Q: What are your thoughts on quantitative easing's (QE)impact on value investing?
A: QE has distorted all valuations, not just in the public markets. With cheaper money, higher P/Es can be justified. But should they when you can still buy other markets at a discount with more growth and better yields?
You might have to look farther and work harder to uncover value today, but the harder we look the luckier we get.
Q: What is your view on the gradual fund flow from active investing to passive investing? Will passive flows eventually create more bubbles?
A: Today over 50% of the market is held by passive investors; three companies comprise 80% of that market share. I worry that this is eroding price discovery. I worry that more and more people are crowding into a room, but the exit door is still the same size. We have seen them indiscriminately buy, but we have not seen them sell.
At the same time, this is creating great opportunity. 80% of the positions in our fund are in no major index. We have adopted a private market approach to public equity markets."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will this year begin to assess the green transition of EU states as part of its monitoring of national budgets, a top official said, in a new sign of the bloc's commitment to meet ambitious climate goals.
The commission is responsible for making sure member countries do not overspend public resources. It annually assesses whether governments' spending, revenues and investments are reasonably balanced and do not excessively flout debt and deficit ceilings set in EU rules.
Worried that environmental and other climate-related costs could worsen governments' fiscal positions, the commission will now also check the pace of governments' transition toward a carbon-neutral economy by 2050.
""For the first time in the commission's economic monitoring of national budgets we will have a green variable, which is very important,"" EU economics commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told reporters.
He said European finance ministers would discuss the matter at meetings in Brussels that were underway and would continue on Tuesday.
""It's a change of perspective. When we assess budgets we need to look at expenditures, investments, but also at the results and pace of the green transition,"" he added.
It is unclear how this new attention to the fiscal impact of climate policies could change the way Brussels puts pressure on states to correct their fiscal policies.
The commission could adopt a more benign approach to countries' investments in renewable energies or other measures to reduce carbon emissions. Low-growth, high-debt Italy is asking for that spending to be allowed even when a country's deficit or debt is already above EU limits.
Gentiloni, a former socialist prime minister of Italy who became EU commissioner in December, is heeding that call. But a decision on how to treat green investments has not been made yet, an EU official said.
That could come as part of a review of EU fiscal rules that Brussels plans to unveil in February.
France, Italy and other southern countries of the bloc are keen to soften the rules, seen by many as excessively rigid and complicated. That could spur growth and favor the green transition, supporters of the move say.
But Germany has so far resisted changes, fearing fiscal leeway could unleash uncontrolled spending in some countries and cause financial crises."

134,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 10:39AM ET</span>",Boeing customer Air Lease says 'damaged' MAX brand should be dropped,"By Conor Humphries
DUBLIN (Reuters) - The chairman of major aircraft leasing firm Air Lease (N:AL), which has 150 of Boeing's (N:BA) grounded 737 MAX jet on order, on Monday called on the U.S. manufacturer to drop the ""damaged"" MAX brand to avoid it undermining the plane's value.
The comments by Steven Udvar-Hazy, one of the founders of the airplane leasing industry which finances around half of the world's passenger fleet, echoes a call by U.S. President Donald Trump in April last year to ""rebrand"" its 737 MAX jetliner.
Boeing said last June it had no plans to change the name of the jet. 
""We've asked Boeing to get rid of that word MAX,"" Udvar-Hazy told the Airline Economics aviation finance conference in Dublin. ""I think that word MAX should go down in the history books as a bad name for an aircraft.""
""The MAX brand is damaged and there is really no reason for it,"" he added. 
Boeing is halting production of the 737 MAX this month following the grounding in March of its best-selling plane after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people.
A U.S. official briefed on the matter on Friday said U.S. regulator the Federal Aviation Administration is now unlikely to approve the plane's return until March, and that it could take until April.
Airlines are still trying to gauge passengers' reluctance to fly on the MAX, and how long this will last, Udvar-Hazy said. ""Will it be two months, will it be six months, will it be different in different parts of the world?"" 
""Will people in the U.S. after a few months forget about the accidents and think 'oh, it's just another 737', or are there going to be parts of the world where people are going to be more superstitious and it will take longer for them to erase that stigma?""
The chief executive of another major aircraft lessor, Firoz Tarapore of Dubai Aerospace Enterprises (DAE), told the same conference he was worried he had not seen Boeing ""addressing in a proactive way"" the issue of customer confidence in the aircraft. 
DAE has shelved plans to order hundreds of single-aisle jets from Boeing or rival Airbus, citing high prices. 
Dublin-based lessor Avolon, which has 148 MAX jets on order, was more sanguine, predicting that strong demand for the plane as a Boeing product would support valuation.
""Boeing's 737 MAX will safely return to revenue service in 2020 (and) airlines and passengers will turn up to fly,"" it said in its 2020 Outlook publication. 
Udvar-Hazy said he did not expect the MAX to flood the market and push down lease rates once it is cleared to fly, as Boeing is unlikely to be able to deliver more than 50-60 jets per month including new production. 

Any fall in lease values due to concerns about the MAX were likely to be temporary, Udvar-Hazy said.

Forecasts for the S&P 500's earnings growth over the next two reporting seasons are below those seen in the second and third quarters of last year and are likely “too low,” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note on Monday. Typically, fourth-quarter earnings are 3% to 4% higher than in the second quarter, instead of lower, they said.
“As the year progresses, the optimistic earnings growth forecasts by the sell-side analysts would tend to be downgraded, but crucially without an adverse effect on stocks performance,” the strategists wrote. “What is much more unusual is that the EPS projections for the next two reporting seasons might be too low.”
Global profit downgrades have been outpacing upgrades every week since April, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s global earnings revision index, reflecting analysts’ concerns about the impact of trade wars and slower economic growth. This failed to derail a powerful rally in both U.S. and global equities last year thanks to the continuation of monetary easing by central banks and appealing valuations.
One year ago, JPMorgan’s Matejka recommended being overweight U.S. equities within developed markets, citing better earnings growth relative to the rest of the world. His call turned out to be prescient as the S&P 500 soared 29% in 2019, beating a 25% jump in the MSCI World Index. At the end of September, Matejka reduced his preference for U.S. stocks in favor of euro-area equities.
Although U.S. companies have just started reporting earnings, results so far are “encouraging,” with 28 S&P 500 firms posting 3% profit growth from a year earlier, according to JPMorgan. Looking back at the last three reporting seasons, which saw $1 to $2 upgrades coincide with a rally in equities, the strategists believe a similar scenario will play out again.
Corporate earnings are likely to benefit from a potential peak in the dollar and a subsequent gain in commodity prices, they said. Macro data is also key to the success of profit reports, and the deceleration in global Purchasing Managers’ Index momentum is likely to stop and turn into an acceleration in the coming months, boosting earnings, according to JPMorgan.
Among sectors, the strategists say commodity and luxury firms as well as semiconductors could beat earnings expectations, while staples may lag."

LONDON(Reuters) - Several of Britain's top pension funds say they would have lost hundreds of millions of pounds had they sold out of oil and gas stocks in recent years, highlighting a potential cost to scheme members as funds face pressure to help fight global warming.
While some major investors globally have been making headlines by announcing fossil fuel divestment plans, several pension schemes in Britain warn there could be a big downside.
Schemes for Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire, which together manage 39.6 billion pounds ($51.4 billion) in assets, estimate in their annual reports they would have lost more than 600 million pounds combined had they divested from fossil fuels.
""We have to demonstrate that our investment decisions do not threaten ... financial performance,"" Greater Manchester, Britain's largest local government pension fund, said in the report for the 12 months to the end of March 2019.
Manchester said it had gained more than 400 million pounds in returns over a three-year period by remaining in energy stocks such as  BP  (L:BP) and  Centrica  (L:CNA).
West Yorkshire said in its annual report it would have lost around 200 million pounds had it sold holdings in oil and gas companies in the three years to September 2018 and reinvested in other UK stocks. It would have lost 160 million pounds in the three years to September 2019, a spokeswoman said.
Many other large schemes in Britain share their views.
Reuters contacted 47 of Britain's largest pension funds, with 33 saying they were not divesting from fossil fuels. Some highlighted the potential impact on returns, and their preference to engage with oil and gas companies as reasons.
Global policymakers, such as outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney, are concerned fossil fuel investments will lose value as economies switch to renewable energy to curb global warming.
Scandinavian pension funds and church groups and university endowments around the world have pulled out of fossil fuel investment, according to research by Fossil Free.
In Britain, smaller local government schemes have taken the lead, including Clwyd in Wales which is planning a new strategy involving divestment. Southwark in south London said divestment had helped it improve returns, but few large schemes are following suit.
Reuters asked 31 of the largest local government pension schemes in Britain and 16 more of the nation's biggest pension funds for their views.
""We feel committing to divest from fossil fuels at the present time would be not the right decision, because almost every business in the world to some extent depends on the use of fossil fuels,"" said Tamsin Rabbitts, senior accountant (pensions and treasury management) at Nottinghamshire County Council.
Nottingham's pension fund preferred to drive corporate change through engagement, Rabbitts said.
Divesting was ""dangerous"", another local authority pension fund manager said, because it risked lower returns.
Many big funds said they preferred to focus on companies' carbon footprint. Manchester said it was moving 2.5 billion pounds of the fund's assets into a low carbon strategy.
However, London Pensions Fund Authority said it was divesting and four more said they were reviewing their position, while nine made no comment or did not respond.
Universities Superannuation Scheme, one of Britain's biggest pension funds, said in a recent presentation it was considering whether there were assets which over time were ""likely to wither and die or experience seismic shocks"", without naming sectors.
Brunel Pension Partnership, which manages investments for 10 schemes, said it supported giving companies an ultimatum to clean up.
""A threat to divest ... forms part of a successful engagement approach,"" said Faith Ward, Brunel's Chief Responsible Investment Officer."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Everyone knows that the global corporate tax system needs to be overhauled, Apple (O:AAPL) Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Monday, backing changes to global rules that are currently under consideration.
The growth of internet giants such as Apple has pushed international tax rules to the limit, prompting the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to pursue global reforms over where multinational firms should be taxed.
The reforms being examined center around the booking of profits by multinational firms in low-tax countries such as Ireland where they have bases - and where Cook was speaking on Monday - rather than where most of their customers are.
""I think logically everybody knows it needs to be rehauled, I would certainly be the last person to say that the current system or the past system was the perfect system. I'm hopeful and optimistic that they (the OECD) will find something,"" Cook said.
""It's very complex to know how to tax a multinational... We desperately want it to be fair,"" the Apple CEO added after receiving an inaugural award from the Irish state agency responsible for attracting foreign companies recognizing the contribution of multinationals in the country.
Apple is one of Ireland's largest multinational employers with 6,000 workers and both it and the Irish government have gone to court to fight a European Union order that Apple must pay 13 billion euros ($14.41 billion) in back taxes to Dublin.
The appeal to the EU's second-highest court began in September and could run for years. Cook said Apple's belief that ""law should not retrofitted"" was at the heart of the case and that the company had great faith in the justice system.
Apple's commitment to Ireland, which became its first European operation in 1980, was ""unshakable"", Cook said.
The Apple chief executive also said that more regulation was needed in the area of privacy and must go further than the 2018 European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy laws that handed regulators there significantly more powers.
""I think more regulation is needed in this area, it is probably strange for a business person to be talking about regulation but it has become apparent that companies will not self-police in this area,"" he said.
""We were one of the first to endorse GDPR, we think it is overall extremely good, not only for Europe. We think it's necessary but not sufficient. You have to go further and that further is required to get privacy back to where it should be.""

Investing.com -- Who can resist a bargain?
Not mining giant   Anglo American   (LON:AAL), apparently. Nor, for that matter, defense giant BAE Systems (LON:BAES), both of whom have announced opportunistic acquisitions on Monday.
But the two deals have very different backgrounds and outlooks, and have provoked correspondingly different reactions.
BAe’s shares rose as much as 3.2% to an 18-month high after it said it would buy two military businesses that U.S. antitrust regulators are forcing Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) to sell as part of their proposed merger.
That merger was always likely to end in some rare and valuable assets coming on to the market, and the highly regulated nature of the defense business meant that BAe had relatively little competition for them. As a result, it’s been able to pick up Raytheon's Airborne Tactical Radios business for $275m and Collins Aerospace’s Military Global Positioning System business for $1.925 billion. Both deals are cheap enough to fund via cash and new debt alone.
BAe said it expects the deals to be immediately accretive to margins and earnings, and combined tax benefits of some $365 million make the deal even sweeter. 
The other big deal of the morning is a less clear-cut affair.  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) has also snapped up what -- at least on paper -- has the potential to be a lucrative asset, literally for pennies. It's agreed to buy Sirius Minerals, the owner of a huge prospective potash mine under a corner of northern England, for 5.5 pence a share, or 400 million pounds ($520 million) - barely 15% of the peak valuation in 2016.
Anglo’s shares fell 0.2% on the news, although they still outperformed other FTSE-listed rivals that were hit by profit-taking after drifting higher recently on increased optimism for global growth. That optimism will be tested at 8 AM ET by the publication of the IMF’s latest growth forecasts.
Sirius’ main asset is a huge resource of polyhalite, a mineral that it says can be commercialized into potash fertilizer, which raises the productivity of arable land. But the startup ran out of money last year after failing to raise debt to complete the mine, having already spent $1.1 billion on it. That task, with all the associated project risk which includes almost 40 kilometers of underground tunnelling and sharp increases in heavy traffic in an area protected because of its natural beauty, now falls to Anglo. On the upside, the U.K. now has a government that has made expansive promises to rejuvenate the economy of northern England, something that will generate at least some political tailwind.
By 5 AM ET (1000 GMT), BAe was up 2.6%, while the FTSE 100 was down 0.3%, supported by housebuilding stocks after data from Rightmove showed the biggest ever increase in U.K. house prices for a January.
The Stoxx 600 benchmark was down 0.2% at 423.60, while the German DAX was down 0.1%."

(Reuters) - European shares retreated on Monday after striking a record closing high in the previous session, as investors paused before launching into a week packed with economic data and the European Central Bank's first policy meeting of the year.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down about 0.3%, after gaining nearly 1% on Friday on optimism around U.S.-EU trade talks to address long-standing issues such as a French digital tax and aircraft subsidies.
Market activity was thin on Monday on account of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in the United States, with Asian shares hovering near 20-month highs.
The benchmark European index has risen about 2% in January, as investors bet on faster global growth amid improving economic indicators and cooling U.S.-China trade tensions.
For the week, all eyes will be on readings of the Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) from the euro zone, after a recent Reuters poll showed economists expected a slowdown in the bloc to have bottomed out in 2019.
""Markets increasingly think that we have seen the bottom regarding the industry so if the PMIs would surprise on the downside, that would be a risk to market sentiment,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank.
Traders will also look to comments from ECB Chief Christine Lagarde on inflation and economic growth in 2020 at the central bank's first policy meeting for the year on Thursday, where the bank is expected to keep the deposit rate unchanged after cutting it in September for the first time since 2016.
""The ECB rendezvous will likely be the most interesting one as the new president launches the central bank's second strategic review in the euro's two decade history,"" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.

143,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 04:57AM ET</span>",Climate change pushes investors to take their temperature,"By Simon Jessop and Matthew Green
LONDON (Reuters) - Move over revenue growth and dividend payouts: it's time to take your portfolio's temperature. 
Policymakers are pushing investors to do more to ensure their portfolio choices help to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change by limiting planetary warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5C.
A vanguard of insurers and pension funds, many of whom will be in Davos this week for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, say part of the answer is a new ""temperature score"" that gives a snapshot of how their investments are contributing to climate change.
A single score, they say, can help them navigate the reallocation of capital from heavily polluting sectors of the global economy likely to take a financial hit to greener companies poised to profit.
So far, the temperature metric has been adopted by only a handful of the thousands of financial institutions worldwide but the buzz it has generated shows how investors' concerns about climate risk are finally moving into the mainstream.
""There's still a massive amount of work to be done on this but it's very encouraging that we as an industry are being forced to answer this temperature score question,"" said Mark Lewis, head of sustainability research at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management.
""If you thought you could ignore climate change before, you just can't anymore.""
France is leading the way with 18 firms, including insurer AXA and reinsurer Scor, disclosing the temperature score of all or part of their portfolios in 2018.
British regulators have flagged that they could require some banks and insurers to report temperature scores from 2021 in annual portfolio stress tests.
Asset manager  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen, German reinsurer Munich Re, Swiss rival Swiss Re and Zurich Insurance all told Reuters they were considering assigning temperature scores to their portfolios.
INCREMENTAL INDICATOR
Temperature scores are one of several investor-led initiatives to spring up in the last few years as policymakers crank up the pressure on the financial industry to accelerate change.
The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a European body of mainly pension funds and asset managers with 30 trillion euros ($33 trillion) of combined assets under management, launched an initiative in May to work out how members can use their financial clout to back the Paris goals.
That was followed by the launch of the ""Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance"" at a U.N. climate summit in September. The group, which has so far signed up 16 insurers and pension funds with combined assets of almost $4 trillion, has pledged to align investments with the most ambitious Paris temperature targets.
The world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), last week announced an overhaul of the way it approaches climate risk. Chief Executive Larry Fink told the thousands of companies it holds stakes in that sustainable investing was the ""strongest foundation"" for client portfolios.
Generation Investment Management, a fund co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore with $25 billion of assets invested according to environmental and sustainability criteria, says temperature scores are an important development. 
""This is an incremental indicator dial to help the stakeholder community engage in the urgency of the transition,"" David Blood, co-founder and senior partner, told Reuters.
TRICKY CALCULATION
Despite the growing enthusiasm for temperature scores, a dearth of standardized data, methodologies and disclosure makes it extremely hard to calculate a single meaningful number.
Andrew Howard, head of sustainable research at British asset manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR), said his company was actively looking at adopting temperature scores but warned any approach must be ""robust and logical"".
""There are a bunch of challenges here that you've got to work,"" he said.
Investors have already been struggling with a comparatively simpler metric: the amount of greenhouse gases a company produces. Increasingly firms are estimating their ""carbon intensity"" based on the ratio of emissions to revenue.
A portfolio temperature score, though, requires more complex calculations, including how companies contribute to global emissions and their planned reductions over time.
Those numbers are then crunched with assumptions about the relationship between emissions and temperatures. The calculation gets even more complicated when factoring in uncertainty about how the world might conceivably achieve net zero emissions by 2050 - the target scientists say is needed to cap global temperature rises at 1.5C.
""The biggest question mark is what exactly that pathway is going to look like,"" said Mara Childress at the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a global initiative launched by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.
The TCFD said it was considering its position on the possible utility of temperature scores.
The challenge becomes harder when investors look beyond stocks and corporate bonds to real estate and infrastructure, where there is less transparency over emissions, or to sovereign debt, where investors have less scope to engage with borrowers.
Nevertheless, advisory firms say that as data improves, the differences between companies poised to benefit from the transition to a low carbon world, and those that will suffer, will become clearer.
""A warming potential metric really helps you to understand which constituents of a portfolio ... are really the climate culprits,"" said David Lunsford, co-founder of Carbon Delta, part of data analytics and index company MSCI.
""You could be exposed to a lot of risk if you pick companies that are not aligned with a sustainable future.""
STRANDED ASSETS
Scientists have been sounding the alarm over global warming for decades but investors have only begun to pay real attention in the last few years. 
The TCFD, which is backed by the G20, is encouraging companies and banks to reveal more about the climate risks they face, as a precursor to making disclosures mandatory.
Regulators are issuing increasingly strident warnings over the dangers extreme weather poses to economies and the risk that oil and gas infrastructure could be left stranded by a rapid transition to clean energy.
Scientists warn that rises of several degrees could push global food systems to collapse, create many millions of refugees and wipe out coastal cities. 
Speaking at a U.N. summit in December, Carney said temperature scores - also known as ""warming potentials"" - were one of the most promising options for addressing the lack of clarity over climate risk and helping companies cut emissions.
""Such a forward-looking measure can help asset owners and asset managers understand the transition pathways of their investments and develop strategies to align financial flows with the necessary transition to net zero,"" said Carney, who starts a new role as U.N. climate envoy next month.
The temperature scores published to date show how far away the companies in most portfolios are from meeting the Paris goals. Most of the scores assigned by companies such as German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) British rival  Aviva  (LON:AV) and Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, hover between 2.8C and 3.8C.
AXA Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said its temperature score was now down to 3.1C.

""The question is for us: How do we get down from 3.1 to lower?"" he said. ""We've been very clear - and again it'll be over time that we'll have to do it - that we want to take actions and go down.""

Please refresh for updates for UK market news from the LSE’s RNS on individual UK shares from FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and FTSE All-Share.
 

Shopping mall operator Intu (LON:INTUP) confirmed reports at the weekend that it is planning a capital increase around the time of its annual result presentation in February.

 

Intu didn’t confirm the intended scale of the offering, which the Sunday Times had estimated at around billion pounds, saying only that it is “engaged in constructive discussions with both shareholders and potential new investors on the proposed equity raise.”

 

In a brief update on its holiday season performance, Chief Executive Matthew Roberts also said that total footfall was up 0.3% on the year overall, and flat in the U.K., which appears a creditable performance in the light of December’s wretched retail sales figure.

 

Roberts also said that occupancy was stable at 95% and that the group has already collected 97% of rent due for the first quarter, “demonstrating the lower risk of our existing customer base.”


Mining group   Anglo American   (LON:AAL) said it would buy   Sirius Minerals   (LON:SXX) in a cash deal valued at 404.9 million pounds, throwing a lifeline to the struggling potash firm.

Sirius shareholders will receive 5.50 pence per share, an increase of 34.1% on the Jan. 7 closing price, the day before  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) announced it was in talks to buy the fertilizer company.

The chairman of Sirius Minerals urged shareholders to accept the offer, warning that the company faced administration if the deal did not go through. 
""If the acquisition is not approved by shareholders...there is a high probability that the business could be placed into administration or liquidation within weeks,,” said Sirius Chairman Russell Scrimshaw. ""This outcome would most likely result in shareholders losing all of their investment, as well as put the future of the entire project, and its associated benefits for the local area and the U.K, at risk.""

Premium tonic water maker Fevertree Drinks (LON:FEVR) warned revenue for 2019 would be below expectations as a result of subdued trading in the U.K. over the Christmas period.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) is likely to have a hard time regaining ground lost in the 10 months it was banned from the big-money business of sponsoring IPOs in Hong Kong, where Chinese rivals have become formidable players, bankers and analysts said.
The Swiss bank's unprecedented year-long ban ended two months early after regulators last week said standards had improved since it found due diligence failings during an industry-wide probe that has led to HK$900 million ($116 million) in fines.
""After the fines, international banks - especially UBS - have the problem of clients perceiving due diligence processes as more rigorous and protracted with an international bank than a Chinese firm, making the latter more attractive,"" said Benjamin Quinlan, chief executive of consultancy Quinlan & Associates.
Equity capital markets (ECM) - including initial public offering (IPO) sponsorship - on average make up a third of investment banks' fee pool in the Asia-Pacific region, or a quarter globally.
Hong Kong ranked third globally last year for IPOs behind the Saudi Exchange and Nasdaq, raising $25 billion.
Among banks in Hong Kong, UBS has ranked in the top 10 in each of the past 15 years bar two, which came in the four years since the lender first disclosed the regulatory probe, Dealogic data showed. During its ban, UBS was limited to minor IPO roles.
""ECM business in Hong Kong has become harder for international banks, who face fierce competition from Chinese competitors, many of whom have much larger onshore coverage ... allowing them to serve a broader range of potential clients,"" said Quinlan.
Mainland China-based banks accounted for an average 34% of new listings by volume in Hong Kong over the past four years, versus 22% in the decade to 2016, showed Reuters calculations from Delaogic data.
BUSIER
UBS made 30% of its 2018 investment banking pre-tax profit in the Asia-Pacific region, where it stood out from international rivals due to its ties with Chinese state-owned enterprises - many of which it helped list in Hong Kong - as well as its market-leading position in Australian deals and ECM.
""I'll certainly be busier than last year. It's good news for the franchise and for us who didn't leave for rivals after the ban,"" said one China-focused UBS investment banker.
""It's also a good time to win back several important clients which didn't feel very comfortable working with us (during the ban),"" the banker said.
Another Hong Kong-based UBS banker said staff would feel the pressure: ""We have to work harder as there won't be any excuses for the lack of good deals or low league table ranking.""
Both declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic. A UBS spokesman declined to comment.
The early end to the IPO sponsorship ban, coming just ahead of UBS' earnings report on Tuesday, offers the Swiss bank a brighter start to the year after a difficult 2019.
In November, UBS paid the joint largest-ever fine levied on a bank in Hong Kong of HK$400 million for overcharging as many as 5,000 clients.
That followed a comment in June related to pork prices by a UBS economist was interpreted as racist by some in China and necessitated extra work with clients by senior bankers.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd on Monday named its youngest president as its new smartphone chief as the firm seeks to defend its lead in the handset market from rising challenges from rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
The South Korean firm also promoted the head of its network equipment business, which analysts said got a lift from a U.S. campaign to convince allies to bar Huawei from their networks.
Samsung took an early lead in smartphones running on quicker fifth-generation (5G) telecommunication networks, but Huawei is widely expected to boost sales of 5G-capable smartphones and equipment this year, leveraging its huge home market.
""Samsung's reshuffle seems aimed at coping with a potential major market change with the new technology,"" said analyst Tom Kang at Counterpoint. ""The young executive is known to be decisive and so is likely to respond swiftly to that change to defend Samsung's lead from Huawei.""
Long-time smartphone leader Samsung held a 21% market share in the third quarter, but Huawei closed in with 18%, showed the latest data from Counterpoint. That came even as Huawei in May was banned from doing business with most U.S. firms, preventing its access to technology like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Android.
NETWORK CHIEF 
Samsung appointed Roh Tae-moon, currently its youngest-ever president at 51, as mobile chief as part of a reshuffle that came later than usual amid a series of court cases involving some of its top executives including leader Jay. Y Lee.
Roh championed Samsung's shift to outsource more handset production to cut costs and better compete with lower-priced Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei, people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.
As former mobile development head, Roh led development of Samsung's Galaxy mobile devices, and is tasked with re-invigorating the organization at a time of heated smartphone competition, the South Korean company said in a statement.
Samsung's network business chief Cheun Kyung-whoon, who was involved in the world's first commercialization of 5G services in South Korea, was promoted to president to help turn networking into a major business for the firm, Samsung said.
Samsung, a laggard in the telecom network equipment market, has been pouring resources into the business, aiming to capitalize on the security fears hobbling market leader Huawei.
Huawei has been bogged down denying allegations by the United States that the Chinese state could use its equipment for spying and so should not be used in 5G networks.
STABILITY
Samsung, the world's biggest smartphone maker and memory chip maker, also kept its three co-chief executives in the annual review, a move highlighting stability ahead of a ruling on a bribery case involving its leader Lee.
In August, the Supreme Court overturned an appeal ruling that had given Lee, 51, a suspended prison term, raising the possibility of a tougher sentence and potential return to jail.
Former mobile chief and co-chief executive DJ Koh will continue to lead Samsung's IT & mobile communications (IM) division, which oversees both mobile devices and network equipment.

Samsung stock was up 2.5% versus 0.9% for the benchmark index.

LONDON (Reuters) - A subsidiary of Airbus (PA:AIR), the world’s largest planemaker, is preparing to launch a financial product aimed at helping its airline customers hedge against risks to revenue, officials said.
Skytra Ltd, a fully-owned subsidiary, plans to launch listed financial futures and options on exchanges this year that will represent airlines revenue and help the industry manage risks more efficiently.
Airlines typically hedge their fuel costs and foreign exchange exposures but the Skytra exchange is the first of its kind for the industry.
While airline infrastructure and operational commitments are planned years into the future, the majority of airline tickets are sold in the five weeks before take-off, according to a statement from Skytra.
Even those airline ticket prices are subject to constant change due to external factors including supply or demand surges, political issues, or tax and economic uncertainty.
But with no existing financial instrument to manage air travel revenue volatility effectively despite a fixed cost base, airlines remain financially vulnerable which Skytra’s product offering aims to address.
The London-based firm has developed a suite of global and regional indices that will track the daily changes in the price of air travel in each geographic market, based on an industry measure of demand called revenue per passenger kilometer (RPK) which measures the number of kilometers traveled by paying passengers.
“Finally we will have a risk management instrument tailor-made for the air travel industry that will help us manage our exposure to ticket price volatility more efficiently,” said Christine Rovelli, head of treasury at Finnair (HE:FIA1S).
Skytra aims to launch indices for six of the most active geographic sectors and roll them out to other sectors gradually, executives at the firm said.
The product will be similar to typical futures contracts traded on most exchanges with quarterly expiries and offering contracts of up to two years.
Matthew Tringham, co-founder at Skytra, said he expects the product to bridge as much as 85% of the gap between costs and revenue for a typical airline.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents nearly 300 airlines, expects industry revenue to expand by 4% to $872 billion in 2020 with revenue from other sources taking it to close to $1 trillion.
The products will be overseen by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and regulatory approval is expected in the coming months ahead of a launch by the end of 2020."

""Our market share in consumer is probably 12, 13, 14 percent, depending on who counts . ...  The reality is, you could double that,"" Moynihan said https://on.ft.com/2NEtMda in an interview with the Financial Times, pointing out that some auto, soft drink and beer companies had massively more consumer share than Bank of America.
Moynihan did not provide a time frame in his interview for doubling the bank's consumer market share.
""If we do a good job for the customers and clients and we're fair in our pricing, I think that's good because  ...  the scale that we have enables us to do more for the customers,"" he was quoted as saying, when asked whether greater concentration in banking was good for customers or likely to garner more scrutiny from regulators.
With deposits growing above the industry rate, a low risk loan portfolio and a strong balance sheet with billions in excess liquidity, the pieces were in place for the bank to continue taking market share, he told the FT.
The CEO of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender added that he would not look overseas for retail growth, as it would take years for the bank to achieve a market share capable of giving it material deposits or revenue.
Bank of America is the second largest bank in the United States, with consumer banking its biggest business."

PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said it plans to buy a building in central Paris to house up to 450 staff in coming years, as it relocates some services from London after Britain's exit from the European Union.
The expansion is expected to make the French capital where it currently has 260 staff, its second-largest base in Europe behind London, which has 10,000 staff, JPMorgan said.
The bank will initially transfer sales teams, followed by trading staff depending on the timing of Britain's full withdrawal from the European Union, Kyril Courboin, JPMorgan's CEO France, told Reuters.
""Paris is going to be the second pole for our market activities in Europe,"" he said.
""London will still be number one because we are only transferring euro activities.""
That reflects a wider trend of banks shifting selected activities to euro-zone cities ahead of Brexit, without calling into question London's dominance as Europe's premier financial center.
An acceleration in the Brexit process, with Britain now due to leave the EU on Jan. 31 and negotiate a new relationship with the bloc during the rest of 2020, had prompted JPMorgan to go ahead with relocation plans, Courboin said.
Political reforms to labor law and the fiscal environment had encouraged it to favor France, he added.
The building purchase was announced on Sunday as part of the ""Choose France"" drive, an annual investment event created by President Emmanuel Macron to draw business leaders to France en route to the World Economic Forum in Davos each January.
The French presidency also unveiled agreements with shipping firm MSC, which will have two cruise ships built in France guaranteeing 2,400 jobs for over three years, and drug manufacturer AstraZeneca  (L:AZN), which will invest $500 million over five years."

The U.S. carmaker last November announced plans to build a giant factory in Gruenheide, in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, giving it the coveted ""Made in Germany"" label just as local rivals prepare to launch competing models.
Tesla's board of directors approved a purchase agreement with the state of Brandenburg on Saturday to acquire a 300-hectare property, Brandenburg government spokesman Florian Engels said in a statement. The state parliament's finance committee had already approved the sale on January 9.
A Tesla spokeswoman confirmed the deal.
The agreement states a preliminary property price of 40.91 million euros ($45.36 million) which can be amended if an external review provides a different value, Engels said.
The property is in a designated industrial area and is being checked for weapons from World War II as there are most likely unexploded U.S. bombs still in the ground, he added.
Politicians, unions and industry groups have welcomed Tesla's move which is expected to create up to 7,000 jobs in Brandenburg.
But some 250 locals took to the streets to protest on Saturday, fearing the factory could endanger the water supply and wildlife in the surrounding forest."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Lotte Group founder Shin Kyuk-ho, who started manufacturing chewing gum in 1948 in Japan and built the business into South Korea's No.5 conglomerate with interests ranging from retail to chemicals, died on Sunday, the company said. He was 98.
He was the last of the South Korean entrepreneurs who founded the country's major chaebols, or family-run conglomerates, that now dominate Asia's fourth-largest economy.
Lotte was founded in 1948 as a chewing gum maker in Japan by Shin, who moved to the neighboring country when the Korean peninsula was under Japanese colonial rule. He married a Japanese woman and they had two sons, who later feuded over control of the business empire in 2015.
Now, Shin Dong-bin, the younger son, is at the helm of the retail conglomerate.
Due to its deep links to Japan, Lotte has sometimes faced a public backlash in South Korea, leading to a boycott of its products when ties between the two countries worsened.
In 2017, Lotte also became the biggest corporate casualty of South Korea's diplomatic row with China over Seoul's decision to deploy a U.S. anti-missile system to counter North Korean threat. Lotte, which offered land for the system, saw most of its supermarkets suspended by Chinese authorities, and eventually pulled out of the operations.
Shin, by then wheelchair-bound, was sentenced to three years in prison in 2018 for embezzlement and breach of duty. But he was excused from serving time because of his poor health.
Lotte, which owns the country's tallest 123-story skyscraper, is a household name in South Korea, with the conglomerate's interests ranging from snacks and beverages to supermarkets, department stores, hotels, theme parks and cinemas. One of its flagship units is Lotte Chemical (KS:011170), which has a factory in the United States."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Around 250 Germans on Saturday protested in the outskirts of Berlin where electric car startup Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is planning to build a gigafactory, saying its construction will endanger water supply and wildlife in the area.
The U.S. carmaker announced plans last November to build its first European car factory in Gruenheide, in the eastern state of Brandenburg.
Politicians, unions and industry groups have welcomed the move, saying it will bring jobs to the region, but environmental concerns drove hundreds of locals to the streets on Saturday.
""We are here, we are loud, because Tesla is stealing our water,"" protesters called.
Saturday's protest came after a Brandenburg water association on Thursday warned against ""extensive and serious problems with the drinking water supply and wastewater disposal"" for the proposed factory.
Anne Bach, a 27-year-old environmental activist, said Tesla's plans published earlier this month showed it would need more than 300 cubic meters of water per hour which would drain the area's declining reserves.
""I am not against Tesla ... But it's about the site; in a forest area that is a protected wildlife zone. Is this necessary?"" Bach said.
""In such an ecological system like the one here and with the background that climate is changing, I cannot understand why another location was not selected from the beginning,"" said Frank Gersdorf, a member of ""Citizens' Initiative Gruenheide against Gigafactory"", a local group that organized Saturday's protest.
Environmentalist protests in Germany have previously halted and delayed major companies' plans such RWE's lignite mining at the Hambach forest, near Cologne, which has become a symbol of the anti-coal protests.
Saturday's protest, which Gersdorf and Bach said developed spontaneously from a 50-people forest walk demonstration, highlighted the deforestation of around 300 hectares to build the factory and its impact on wildlife, including birds, insects and bats.
People were also protesting against an expected ""enormous"" increase in traffic on a nearby highway and through the villages.
Next to the protest, on the other side of the street, around 20 people carried banners welcoming Tesla in their village, with children chanting, ""We are here, we are loud, because Tesla is building our future.""
Bernd Kutz, a Gruenheide local, said Tesla would bring improvement to the area, create jobs and give chances to young people.
""I am here because I don't understand those demonstrators who shout and show us the finger,"" Kutz said. ""Why has it always to be negative?"""

Beijing has been pushing forward the program where drugmakers have to go through a bidding process and cut prices low enough to be considered over generic copies and be allowed to sell their products at public hospitals via large-volume government procurement.
Some global firms such as AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and Merck (N:MRK) have already cautioned about intensifying price pressures on their mature brands in the world's second largest drug market, as China expands the usage of the program.
In the latest bidding on Friday that involved 33 drugs and 122 companies, Bayer (DE:BAYGn) slashed the price of its popular diabetes treatment Acarbose to 0.18 yuan ($0.0262) per pill, 78.5% lower than the price ceiling set by the government in December last year, elbowing some Chinese generic providers out of the tender, according to a Reuters calculation based on the preliminary results released by the authority overseeing the program.
Bayer was not immediately available for a comment.
""Products that won bids in this round of centralized procurement saw a huge price drop, which squeezes out unreasonable overpricing that has existed in drug distribution for a long time,"" the authority said in a statement published alongside the preliminary result on Friday.
Sale prices of over 100 types of commonly used drugs are on average about 17 to 18 times of their manufacturing costs, the statement said.
Chinese copycats won bids for most of the 33 drugs, including generic versions for drugs ranging from Johnson & Johnson's (N:JNJ) prostate cancer treatment Zytiga to Eli Lilly's (N:LLY) erectile dysfunction treatment Cialis, the results showed.
In Friday's bidding, for products with two bid winners, 60% of the government procurement volume can be shared among the winners, according to official document detailing the tender rules released in December. For products with four winners and more, as much as 80% of the volume can be shared among the companies.
In the first round of the nationwide implementation of the bulk-buy program in September, global drugmakers including Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Eli Lilly managed to cut some prices low enough to levels close to those offered by local generic makers."

VANCOUVER/TORONTO (Reuters) - Extraditing Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to the United States based on American sanctions against Iran would set a dangerous precedent and could even undermine Canada's policy towards Iran, Meng's lawyers argued in court documents released on Friday.
Meng, 47, was arrested at the Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018, at the request of the United States, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading the bank HSBC (L:HSBA) about Huawei Technologies' business in Iran. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.
Canada's attorney general said in submissions released last week that Meng was being extradited because she fraudulently mislead HSBC, and that U.S. sanctions should be taken into account as contributing to the legal environment in which the fraud took place - not as a reason for the extradition.
Meng's team called the attorney general's argument ""circular,"" arguing that because prosecutors relied on U.S. sanctions to establish a risk of economic deprivation in both countries, ""American law becomes Canadian law. Double criminality becomes single criminality.""
They wrote that allowing the attorney general to use U.S. sanctions as a reason to extradite set a dangerous precedent, because it would ""interfere with the (Canadian) government's prerogative in foreign affairs ... In a democratic society, important public policy choices are best made in the elected legislative assembly rather than by judicial actors.""
Meng appeared in court on Friday for the first time in several months, for a case management conference to schedule hearings addressing the Canadian attorney general's claims of privilege on releasing some documents requested by Meng's legal team.
Wearing dark slacks and sipping from a pink thermos, Meng appeared calm but serious, refraining from waving to journalists as she has while entering the courtroom on other occasions.

The first phase of the extradition hearing will begin on Monday in a federal court in Vancouver.

(Reuters) - A Pennsylvania judge on Friday slashed to $6.8 million from $8 billion a punitive damages award against Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to a man who said it failed to warn that boys using its antipsychotic drug Risperdal could grow breasts.
Judge Kenneth Powell of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas reduced the payout that a jury awarded Oct. 8 to the plaintiff Nicholas Murray, a Maryland resident.
No reason was given for the reduction, which was disclosed in court records. Lawyers for Murray have said the punitive damages award was the first in thousands of lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit over Risperdal.
Murray claimed he had been prescribed the drug in 2003, when he was 9, to treat symptoms related to autism. He had previously been awarded $680,000 in compensatory damages.
Both sides pledged to appeal.
""The ruling is wrong (and) provides essentially no punishment for the worst of the worst of corporate misconduct,"" Murray's lawyer Thomas Kline said in an email. ""We believe that when the merits are reviewed that the $8 billion will be reinstated.""
Johnson & Johnson said that while Powell ""appropriately reduced the excessive punitive damages award,"" he wrongly excluded evidence that Risperdal's label ""clearly and appropriately"" outlined the risks of use.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Risperdal in 1993 to treat schizophrenia and bipolar mania in adults, and in 2006 for irritability associated with autism in children.
Plaintiffs suing over the drug have said Johnson & Johnson concealed the link between Risperdal and excessive growth of female breast tissue in boys, known as gynecomastia.
While doctors may prescribe many drugs as they see fit, including for off-label uses, Murray said Johnson & Johnson should have warned his doctors about Risperdal's side effects.
Johnson & Johnson said in October it faced lawsuits by 13,600 people over Risperdal.
The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company agreed separately in 2013 to pay $2.2 billion to settle U.S. criminal and civil probes into its marketing of Risperdal and two other drugs.

In late afternoon trading, Johnson & Johnson shares were up 74 cents at $148.94.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Friday it will review a petition asking the agency to formally investigate and recall 500,000 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc vehicles over sudden unintended acceleration reports.
The petition covers 2012 through 2019 model year Tesla Model S, 2016 through 2019 Tesla Model X, and 2018 through 2019 Tesla Model 3 vehicles, the agency said. The petition cites ""127 consumer complaints to NHTSA involving 123 unique vehicles. The reports include 110 crashes and 52 injuries,"" the agency added. 
Late Friday, NHTSA released a redacted version of the lengthy petition that said ""Tesla vehicles experience unintended acceleration at rates far exceeding other cars on the roads"" and urged NHTSA ""to recall all Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles produced from 2013 to the present.""
The petition cited media reports of crashes attributed to unintended acceleration and complaints filed with NHTSA.
Tesla did not immediately comment Friday.
Many of the complaints report sudden acceleration incidents when attempting to park vehicles in a garage or at a curb. Others claimed the sudden acceleration happened while in traffic or when using driver assistance systems and led to crashes.
In one complaint, a driver said a 2015 Tesla Model S 85D in California was closed and locked when he claimed ""a few moments later the vehicle started accelerating forward towards the street and crashed into a parked car.""
A Tesla driver in Avondale, Pennsylvania, was pulling into a parking spot at an elementary school when the vehicle accelerated on its own, the complaint said adding: ""It went over a curb and into a chain link fence.""
Another complaint said a Tesla driver in Andover, Massachusetts was approaching her garage door ""when the car suddenly lurched forward: and ""went through the garage door destroying two garage doors."" The Tesla stopped when it hit the garage's concrete wall. 
In October, the agency said it was reviewing whether Tesla should have recalled 2,000 of its electric cars in May instead of issuing a software upgrade to fix a potential defect that could have resulted in battery fires in Model S and Model X vehicles from the 2012-2019 model years.
The 2,000 vehicles covered by the September petition to the NHTSA received a battery management software upgrade in May in response to a potential flaw that could trigger non-crash-related fires. A lawyer who filed the petition, Edward Chen, told Reuters in October that he strongly believes ""this number is much larger than 2,000."" The review is ongoing.
Last week, NHTSA said it was probing the Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana.
The crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA's special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects the company's so-called Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.

On Feb. 25, the National Transportation Safety Board will meet to determine the probable cause of the 2018 fatal crash of a Tesla Model X in Mountain View, California. The driver was using Autopilot at the time of the crash.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Reports from Netflix, Intel and Texas Instruments next week may hint at what is to come in the December quarterly earnings season, with some investors wary of possible danger signs that could knock Wall Street after its latest surge to record highs.
The S&P 500 has gotten off to a strong start in January, up 3% so far this year, fueled by a truce in the U.S.-China trade war, low interest rates and signs the economy remains healthy.
Analysts on average expect reports to show S&P 500 earnings per share fell 0.8% in the fourth quarter, with technology earnings seen up 0.6%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Investors are looking beyond fourth-quarter results at what companies may say about outlooks and plans for investment in light of the recently signed Phase 1 trade deal between Washington and Beijing.
Earnings estimates for the fourth quarter have already weakened slightly in the latest week as initial reports from big banks and a smattering of other companies filtered in.
""Most of the rally we had in 2019 was in anticipation of better earnings in 2020,"" said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. ""Rather than getting caught up in what the Q4 numbers are, the attention will be on what - if any - revisions you get to Q1 and Q2 numbers.""
Analyst estimates for quarterly earnings tend to decline as any given quarter approaches, and any hint that estimates for 2020 are bucking that trend would be positive, Delwiche said.
The S&P information technology index (SPLRCT), which includes such market heavyweights as Apple (O:AAPL), Intel (O:INTC) and Microsoft (O:MSFT), has led Wall Street so far in 2020 with a nearly 6% gain. It is up 50% over the past year, the strongest performer over that period. The index is now trading at 22 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since around early 2005, according to Refinitiv's Datastream.
The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times expected earnings, similar to levels it briefly hit two years ago.
""There's going to be heightened attention to guidance to increase comfort levels with valuations, given the strength we've seen in the last two months in the majority of tech names,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
Because of that, ""you're more likely to see slight disappointments punished more severely than positive guidance is rewarded,"" he added.
Underscoring the importance of results from Intel on Thursday and Apple on Jan. 28, the information technology sector is expected to have accounted for nearly 22% of total S&P 500 operating earnings in the last quarter of 2019, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
""For a lot of the tech names, they seem to be well positioned for 2020,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
Still, in the market overall, ""What has happened is the multiples expanded. And that's really the risk of the market.""
Technology earnings growth for 2020 is estimated at 10.4%, which is expected to contribute 2.0 percentage points to the S&P 500's expected growth rate of 9.7%, according to Refinitiv's data, which would make tech the largest contributor.
Netflix's (O:NFLX) quarterly report on Tuesday after the bell will show how well the video streaming giant is withstanding a wave of competition led by entertainment heavyweight Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS).
Netflix shares stumbled last year on worries over slowing subscriber growth and ballooning costs of high-budget productions such as The Crown and The Irishman. Its shares are down nearly 8% since April 2019, when Disney+ was unveiled. Disney's stock has risen 24% since then.
Netflix shares tend to be volatile after it reports results, which could be the case again.
Netflix options imply a 7.6% swing for the shares in either direction by next Friday, Jan. 24. Over the last eight quarters, on average, the shares moved 6% after the company reported results, according to Trade Alert.
Seen as the chip industry bellwether, Texas Instruments' (N:TXN) report and potential comments from management on Wednesday after the bell will provide evidence of whether a global downturn in semiconductor is bottoming out.
Expectations that the chip industry will soon pick up have fueled a 30% surge in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) since mid-2019.
Analysts on average expect Intel to report a 3% increase in fourth-quarter revenue and to forecast a 7% increase in current-quarter revenue, according to Refinitiv."

Meanwhile, U.S. homebuilding surged to a 13-year high in December, suggesting the housing market recovery was back on track amid low mortgage rates.
""The macro data points both here and abroad have been relatively positive,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""That is creating an increased sense of optimism going into not just the earnings, but also guidance which is far more important at this point for both Q1 and fiscal 2020.""
Analysts expect earnings at S&P 500 companies to drop 0.8% in the fourth quarter, but forecast a 5.8% rise in the first quarter of 2020, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Many investors expect companies to be more upbeat about the future following the truce in the China-U.S. trade war.
""We think the most important thing this earnings season will be what CEOs say about their outlooks,"" said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments in Charlotte. ""That always matters, but we think that because of the speed at which some of these global uncertainties have been resolved, it's unlikely we will see those things coming through in the numbers."" 
Billionaire David Tepper, who founded hedge fund Appaloosa Management, told CNBC that he remains bullish on U.S. equities.
""We have been long and continue that way,"" he said.
All three main indexes closed at record highs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.17% to end at 29,348.1 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.39% to 3,329.62.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.34% to 9,388.94.
For the week, the S&P 500 added 1.96%, the Dow rose 1.82% and the Nasdaq increased 2.29%.
In a thin day for earnings, oilfield service provider Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) reported a slightly better-than-expected quarterly profit, but its stock dipped 1.1%.
Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) rose 2.0%, extending gains after it became the fourth U.S. company to top a market value of $1 trillion on Thursday.
Technology majors including  Visa Inc  (N:V), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) provided among the top boosts to the S&P 500.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 127 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 207 new highs and 14 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.3 billion shares, compared with an average of 7.0 billion shares over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com – The S&P rounded off the week with another record close Friday as a surge in U.S. housing activity strengthened investor hopes the current economic expansion can continue. 
The S&P 500 added 0.39%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.34% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%. 
A surge in housing starts in December to a 13-year high, coupled with stronger-than-expected retail sales earlier this week and underpinned investor confidence in the economy boosting sentiment.
The trend of mostly bullish earnings, meanwhile, continued Friday as Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) reported quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
About 71% of the 44 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings have topped analysts' estimates, while 23% have fallen short, Refinitiv said, citing I/B/E/S data.
In a typical quarter, about 65% of companies beat estimates and 20% miss estimates, Refinitiv said.
Tech, which has played a leading role in the rally this week, continued its climb, led by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and chip stocks like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). 
Fresh from hitting a $1-trillion valuation, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tacked on further gains, rising 2% for the day.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, rose 1% as Nomura and Morgan Stanley become the latest on Wall Street to upgrade their price targets on the iPhone maker.
Energy failed to join in the rally, as global oil demand concerns continued to keep a lid on oil prices.
The bullish end to the week comes as the U.S. and China signed off on their phase one trade deal on Wednesday, ending their two-year trade war.
But while the trade détente ""is certainly good news,"" is did not sort out all the complexities of issues between these two large economies and for sure is not resolving the fundamental questions that need addressing in the trade system so it can succeed in the future.""

Investing.com – Boeing's wings were clipped Friday as one analyst warned that the airplane maker's fourth-quarter profit will likely be hit by a ""substantial charge"" due to the grounding of the 737 Max jets.
Canaccord Genuity cut its price target on Boeing (NYSE:BA) to $350 from $370 and forecasts earnings and sales estimates to come under pressure. Boeing fell about 1%.
""We are surprised the stock has held up as well as it has considering the company is perhaps facing the most severe crisis in its 100-year history, but we continue to see the financial risk as not fully reflected in the stock,"" Canaccord said.
Boeing's efforts to restore its reputation have suffered several setbacks. The latest arrived Friday as the company said it was addressing a new software issue with the 737 Max discovered during testing last week.
Just last week, the company released internal messages that showed employees had mocked and ridiculed customers and regulators alike.
One that said the plane was ""designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys""."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Friday it is addressing a new software issue discovered in Iowa last weekend during a technical review of the proposed update to the grounded Boeing 737 MAX, a development that could further delay the plane's return to service.
""We are making necessary updates,"" Boeing said in a statement. Officials at the planemaker said the issue relates to a software power-up monitoring function that verifies some system monitors are operating correctly.
One of the monitors was not being initiated correctly, officials said. The monitor check is prompted by a software command at airplane or system power up, and will set the appropriate indication if maintenance is required, company officials added.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did not immediately comment. ABC News reported the issue early Friday.
Boeing is halting production of the 737 MAX this month following the grounding in March of its best-selling plane after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people. 
U.S. regulators are waiting for an update from Boeing on how they will resolve the issue. A U.S. official briefed on the matter said Friday the FAA is now unlikely to approve the plane's return until March but it could take until April. 
This week,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (O:AAL) both said they would extend cancellations of MAX flights until early June.
Also this month, the FAA and Boeing said they were reviewing a wiring issue that could potentially cause a short circuit on the grounded 737 MAX. Officials said the review is looking at whether two bundles of wiring are too close together, which could lead to a short circuit and potentially result in a crash if pilots did not respond appropriately.

U.S. and European aviation safety regulators met with Boeing in an effort to complete a 737 MAX software documentation audit that was begun in November. Documentation requirements are central to certification for increasingly complex aircraft software, and can become a source of delays.

183,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 01:41PM ET</span>","U.S. Fed signals lighter touch on bank supervision, foreign bank oversight","By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday signaled it would take a lighter touch when supervising banks, in another win for the industry which has long complained that the regulator's closed-door supervisory process is opaque and capricious.
In particular, foreign lenders  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Credit Suisse (UL:CSAG), UBS and  Barclays  (L:BARC) should no longer be held to the same supervisory standard as big U.S. banks after shrinking their combined U.S. assets by more than 50% over the past decade, said Fed governor Randal Quarles.
""We have been giving significant thought to the composition of our supervisory portfolios and, in particular, to whether and how we should address the significant decrease in size and risk profile of the foreign firms,"" Quarles, who is also vice chair for Fed supervision, told a Washington conference.
His comments come as the Fed pivots from rewriting a raft of rules introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, to reviewing the way it puts them into practice.
While regulation draws bright lines on what lenders can and cannot do, Fed supervisors have discretion as to how those often highly complex rules are interpreted and implemented daily by each institution depending on their business profile.
Banks have complained that the Fed's supervisory process, which is confidential, is too inflexible and applied unevenly and have lobbied for greater transparency and predictability.
The Fed supervises institutions according to different buckets, with the eight riskiest U.S. banks and UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche and Barclays, subject to the strictest scrutiny.
On Friday, Quarles said it no longer made sense to hold those foreign lenders to the same standard as the likes of  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  (N:C) because their riskiness has declined. He suggested supervising them in line with regional banks such as PNC (N:PNC) or  Capital One  (N:COF), potentially changing the competitive landscape for firms in that bucket.
In addition, Quarles outlined a number of ""incremental"" changes to the broader supervisory system that he said should ""increase transparency, accountability and fairness.""
These include allowing banks to share confidential supervisory information with third parties, such as consultants, to make it easier for them to fix issues; limiting the number of written slaps on the wrist the Fed dishes out to banks for minor lapses; and increasing the transparency of models it uses to test banks' resilience to potential economic shocks."
184,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",Foreign banks continue to tap Swiss market,"LONDON (IFR) - Following the previous week's four foreign bank issues, last week saw another three come to market.
Muenchener Hypothekenbank,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and National Australia Bank made up the roster of FIG names, printing SFr640m (US$661m) between them.
On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank continued its issuance spree across currencies and classes - having printed senior non-preferred debt in euros and sterling and covered bonds in euros - with a new Swiss franc offering.
Books opened for a minimum SFr150m five-year at mid-swaps plus 130bp area, with the size quickly increased to a minimum SFr175m before SFr200m was priced at 125bp over.
A total of 37 accounts took part, mostly Swiss, although there were small orders from Germany and Liechtenstein. Asset managers took more than half of the paper (63%), with pension funds and private banks splitting most of the remainder and insurers taking only 7.3%.
The spread level was in line with its euro curve, as well its rather flat Swiss curve. All of Deutsche's Swiss deals maturing in 2022 and 2023 are bid in the context of a 120bp-130bp Z-spread.
Deutsche Bank was sole bookrunner on the Baa3/BBB-/BBB rated deal, with UBS as joint lead no books.
NAB followed on Wednesday with another SFr200m print, this time in nine-year senior unsecured format.
Books opened for a minimum SFr200m at mid-swaps plus 31bp area, with that amount priced in line with guidance, equivalent to 62.4bp over government paper, or a 0.065% yield.
The level was in line with comparable Australian names, with CBA December 2029s quoted at 33bp-27bp ahead of the new deal.
An all-Swiss contingent of investors was led by asset managers, who took nearly three-quarters of the deal.
NAB is rated Aa3/AA-/AA- and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) was sole lead on the deal.
Well-known name and regular issuer in the Swiss market MunHyp on Wednesday mandated Credit Suisse as sole bookrunner for its inaugural Swiss franc-denominated non-preferred senior fixed-rate green bond benchmark, the first green SNP in the franc.
Books opened early on Thursday morning for a minimum SFr100m long five-year due December 2025 at mid-swaps plus 53bp area with an expected 0.125% coupon.
Less than an hour later, it was upsized to a minimum SFr200m at revised 51bp-53bp guidance, before being finalised as SFr240m at 51bp over.
That level put the new green bonds some 7bp inside MunHyp's conventional Swiss franc curve.
The paper was sold to 37 Swiss accounts, mainly asset managers, who took slightly over 70% of the deal. Insurers took nearly 20.5%, while private banks and pension funds took the remainder.
According to one lead official, Switzerland does not really have green-only investors, adding that account managers who were full on the name added fresh limits for the green aspect, and more or less all orders were larger than in a usual transaction.
The bond is expected to be rated A2 Moody's.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said on Friday it will move production of its mid-size Tacoma pick-up truck from the United States to Mexico as it adjusts production around North America.
The largest Japanese automaker also said it will end production of the Toyota Sequoia in Indiana by 2022 as that facility focuses on mid-size SUVs and minivans.
Toyota will shift production of the Sequoia in 2022 to Texas and that plant will end production of the Tacoma by late 2021.
Toyota has been building Tacoma trucks at its Baja California plant in Mexico since 2004. Last month, Toyota's Guanajuato plant began assembly of the Tacoma.
Toyota said its production capacity for the Tacoma in Mexico will be about 266,000 per year. Last year, the automaker sold nearly 249,000 Tacoma pickup trucks in the United States, up 1.3%.
Toyota said the product moves were to ""improve the operational speed, competitiveness and transformation at its North American vehicle assembly plants based on platforms and common architectures.""
The new North American trade agreement approved by the U.S. Senate on Thursday ensures that automakers will still be able to build pickup trucks in Mexico without facing new punitive tariffs.
In February,  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) said it was reversing plans to shift production of heavy-duty trucks from Mexico to Michigan in 2020, freeing a Michigan facility to produce Jeeps.
Toyota said Friday it completed a $1.3 billion modernization investment in its Indiana operations to add 550 jobs. Toyota said there would be no reduction to direct jobs at any of Toyota’s facilities across North America as a result of the vehicle moves."

The investment is part of a broader commitment from Japan's biggest automaker to invest $13 billion in its U.S. operations over five years through 2021.
Including the $1.3 billion investment at the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana (TMMI) plant, the company has so far spent about $7.1 billion of the total amount, Toyota said.
The refurbished TMMI plant, which has added 550 new jobs so far, will help Toyota meet strong demand for the Highlander, its new mid-size SUV.

The plant has over 7,000 employees and has the capacity to assemble more than 420,000 vehicles annually, the company said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. firearms makers will be able within days to export as much as 20% more guns, including assault rifles and ammunition, under rules the Trump administration announced on Friday.
The change, which had been contemplated for more than a decade, will officially move oversight of commercial firearm exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department, where export licenses will be much easier to obtain.
The move https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-guns-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-moves-closer-to-easing-gun-exports-idUSKBN1XH2IY by President Donald Trump's administration will generate business for gun makers such as American Outdoor Brands Corp (O:AOBC) and Sturm Ruger & Co (N:RGR), while increasing the sale of deadly weapons abroad. Relaxing the rules could increase foreign gun sales by as much as 20%, the National Shooting Sports Foundation has estimated.
The Department of Commerce is ""better oriented for the kinds of licensing requirements that we are going to be enforcing."" Rich Ashooh, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration told reporters in a conference call.
A draft of the rules was published on Friday, with publication in the Federal Register expected next week, said Clarke Cooper the State Department's Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs.
""While we are providing industry a some regulatory relief and a cost savings, it does improve enforceability,"" Cooper said.
U.S. Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, called the move ""bad,"" at Tuesday's Forum on the Arms Trade Annual Conference, in comments that echoed arms control advocates. Under the change, Lieu said, more weapons will be sold overseas and ""give Congress even less authority as a check and balance on those sales.""
Under the new rule 3D printed guns will still be regulated. ""This control will help ensure that U.S. national security and foreign policy interests are not undermined by foreign persons' access to firearms production technology,"" a version of the rule posted on the Federal Register said.
Reuters first reported on the Trump administration's interest in the oversight shift in 2017 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-weapons-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-prepares-to-ease-export-rules-for-u-s-guns-idUSKCN1BU2N8.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose on Friday as analysts continued to debate whether the upcoming launch of 5G iPhones will resurrect demand and trigger a wave of phone upgrades.
Morgan Stanley and Nomura raised their price targets on Apple, but have a different outlook on how much Apple's foray into 5G will boost iPhone upgrades.
  Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) raised its price target on Apple to $368 from $296, citing a peak in smartphone replacement cycles – the time customers take to replace their smartphones. 
The bank suggested that features such as longer battery life, 5G technology and ""aggressive"" iPhone trade-in offers implies the cycles ""can't stretch much further and may in fact begin to shrink.""
Nomura raised its price target on Apple to $280 from $225, but appears less optimistic over Apple's upcoming slate of 5G iPhones. The bank pointed to the previous drop in iPhone upgrades during the transition from 3G to 4G as a cautionary tale.
The expected $40 to $80 incremental bill of materials cost will likely also be a barrier to adoption, Nomura added.
But weaker iPhone demand does not carry the threat of impending doom for Apple as it once did.
Apple has made strides to pivot growth toward services and wearables, which now account for 27% and 37% of profits respectively, Morgan said."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's Sinopec, expected to be the next major Chinese buyer of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG), is planning to review terms of a potential $16 billion supply deal with Cheniere Energy Inc after a sharp drop in LNG prices, industry officials said.
That could delay sign-off on a deal that would help Beijing meet ambitious targets it set for U.S. energy purchases in a Phase 1 trade agreement it signed with the United States on Wednesday.
Sinopec, officially named China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, and Houston-based Cheniere had been expected to sign the 20-year deal once a trade truce was reached between Beijing and Washington.
However, the LNG market has shifted since news of Sinopec and Cheniere's negotiations became public early last year. In the intervening period, the U.S.-China trade war sapped Chinese purchases of U.S. LNG, and several other gas suppliers, including Qatar, the lowest-cost producer, decided to build new export plants.
That coming supply would add to an existing glut that has caused gas prices to collapse to their lowest levels in years and could keep them suppressed - giving Sinopec additional leverage with Cheniere.
Both companies declined to comment.
A source familiar with the talks said many items needed to be reviewed as U.S. gas prices have more than halved since 2018. 
""Sinopec is talking to several other U.S. suppliers,"" said a second source. ""It's really not clear at this stage what will come out.""
The firm, as one of the few state buyers with appetite to sign new multi-year LNG supply deals, also needs to lobby Beijing to remove or rebate a 25% tariff that has made U.S. imports uneconomical in the past year, one of the sources said. 
""(The deal) will be renegotiated... over delivery terms and price,"" said an industry executive with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named as the matter is not public. ""It may not be tough, but will take time.""
LITTLE COMMUNICATION
Sinopec, which plans to more than double its LNG receiving capacities to 41 million tonnes by 2025, emerged last year as China's biggest spot buyer of LNG, as it is a much smaller purchaser under long-term deals than PetroChina Co Ltd or China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC).
Those two firms are committed to other long-term contracts, and therefore much less likely to seek new supply agreements with U.S. exporters. They are also facing slower domestic demand growth and weaker prices, which have led to losses in their LNG import business. 
State oil firm China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has already fulfilled its supply needs through existing deals with Cheniere, and is also anticipating new supply from investments in the Russian Arctic and Mozambique, said one trading executive. 
The prospect of buying U.S. LNG is even more remote for China's so-called second-tier independent gas companies, because they have little access to terminal facilities. 
""We'll be in close contact with U.S. suppliers, but price is always the key,"" said Frank Li, assistant to the president of private city gas distributor China Gas Holdings. ""For now Russian pipeline gas is cheaper, Qatari gas is cheaper."" 
A top state-oil trading executive said his level of management had received no internal briefing from the government over what products Beijing had in mind when agreeing the Phase 1 trade deal.

""We're already under steep pressure to absorb high-cost term supplies ... and as the market is expected to stay over-supplied beyond 2023, why should we sign up to more term deals?"" a CNOOC gas manager said.

The Canadian plane and train maker warned its 2019 profits would be lower, citing problematic rail contracts, challenges at its business transportation segment and the delayed delivery of its Global 7500 aircraft.
S&P said Bombardier's weak outlook lowered its conviction that the company could generate positive free operating cash flow beyond 2019 which it believes is necessary for reducing debt.
The rating agency said it expects the free cash flow to be negative in 2020, with poor prospects for material improvement in 2021, and added that if this happened, there could be a further downgrade over the next 12 months.
Bombardier said it now expects free cash flow usage of about $1.2 billion for 2019, marking the third cut to its forecast since the beginning of 2019.
The company's rail division, its largest unit by revenue, is struggling with three rail projects in Europe, resulting in a $350 million charge.
Moody's on Thursday also changed the rating outlook for Bombardier to negative from stable."

LONDON (Reuters) - With Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) becoming the latest entrant to Wall Street's trillion-dollar club, Europe's blue-chip companies are dwarfed by comparison -- the most valuable firm from the ""old continent"", Nestle, is worth just a third of that.
Alphabet surged past the $1 trillion mark late on Thursday, joining Apple (O:AAPL), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Amazon (O:AMZN), which had breached that level in 2018 before giving up some of those gains. 
Add Facebook (O:FB) (current worth: $630 billion) and you get a group with a combined market cap of $5.2 trillion, more than the combined $4.6 trillion value of the STOXX 50 European index (STOXX50).

Comparing entire benchmark stoc indexes, the U.S. S&P 500 (SPX) has a $27.5 trillion price tag, almost three times the $10.1 trillion on the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX). 
There is no place for Europe at the global top 10 table where the cheapest company, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), scrapes in at $430 billion, well above Nestle's $315 billion.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",Mexican autoparts firms eye fast lane after U.S. backs trade deal,"By Sharay Angulo
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican auto parts manufacturers with clients across North America expect a record year after U.S. approval of a trade deal mandating higher regional inputs, but the new rules pose a bigger challenge to carmakers.
After months of wrangling, U.S. lawmakers on Thursday ratified the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), brokered at the behest of President Donald Trump to replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The accord, which Canada's parliament is expected to approve soon, requires automakers to use more local inputs for their cars to qualify for tariff-free trade within North America.
Over a period of years, automakers must gradually raise local content to 75% of a car's value from 62.5%. During the transition to more regional parts production, carmakers face the challenge of reorganizing supply lines.
Auto parts industry association INA pointed to news that three Chinese automakers were considering a move to Mexico as evidence of the lift USMCA should give.
""It's really important, because this will help to boost the numbers in terms of autoparts output,"" Alberto Bustamante, INA's foreign trade chief, told Reuters.
Mexico's economy has been on the brink of recession for the past year. Car sales, output and exports have all fallen and the industry expects them to drop again this year.
By contrast, the autoparts industry, including Mexico-based Rassini (MX:RASSINICPO) and Nemak (MX:NEMAKA) and a wealth of foreign suppliers such as Goodyear (O:GT) and Pirelli (MI:PIRC), grew by 2.2% last year.
INA expects sales in 2020 to surpass $100 billion for the first time, rising to $102 billion from nearly $99 billion.
USMCA was designed to slow the car industry's exodus from the United States and Canada by requiring 40% of a light vehicle and 45% of a pickup to come from ""high wage"" areas paying workers at least $16 an hour.
Another challenge for manufacturers: rules requiring use of North American steel and aluminum.
""It's going to be hard work with our suppliers to meet the new rules, especially the steel and aluminum requirements and the labor content value,"" said Miguel Elizalde, head of the Mexican association of heavy vehicle makers, ANPACT.
Manufacturers in Mexico are confident they can take advantage of the 55-60% of the market they are not priced out of.
Still, Kenneth Smith, Mexico's lead trade negotiator from 2017-2018, said the new terms in the USMCA would be onerous for the industry across North America.
""It's not good for Mexico, for the United States or Canada, because at the end of the day, specialized steels are going to become more expensive for the auto sector,"" he told Reuters.
But after nearly three years of fraught discussions, Mexico could take comfort from the fact that the United States finally signed off the deal.

""It's very good news,"" Smith said. ""And it does give added certainty to investors and exporters.""

198,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 10:31AM ET</span>",'There's no metal': Record-breaking palladium races higher,"By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - A squeeze in ready availability of automotive metal palladium has driven up already record-high prices by 25% in just two weeks, accelerating a four-year rally and stoking expectations for further gains, analysts said.
A long-term supply deficit has led prices of the metal, used mainly in engine exhausts to curb harmful emissions, to double over the last year.
Consumers' immediate needs are often met in the lending market, in which holders of metal put their stocks to work for a profit. However, rates charged to lease palladium have spiked in recent weeks, suggesting availability is tight.
In the futures market, prices of metal for near-term delivery have also moved sharply above those for later-dated contracts - a situation known as backwardation, which also indicates buyers fear a lack of ready supply.
Spot palladium broke above $2,500 an ounce on Friday – its highest ever - from less than $500 in January 2016. Before this rally began, palladium prices had never exceeded $1,100.
""There's no metal,"" said a trader in London. ""Consumers are stockpiling. It's all been shipped to China.""

The roughly 10-million-ounce a year market has been in deficit for most of the last decade.  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) analyst Suki Cooper said she expects 700,000 ounce shortfalls this year and in 2021, and for prices to rise.
In the last two weeks the market flared into deeper backwardation.
(GRAPHIC - Palladium spreads: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8150/8132/2020%20PALLADIUM%20GRAPHIC%20SPREADS.jpg)
Forward and lease rates have also leaped to around 20%, the highest in a year, from around 3% at the start of January.
(GRAPHIC - Palladium forward rates: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8149/8131/2020%20PALLADIUM%20GRAPHIC%20RATES.jpg)
South Africa, which produces two-fifths of the world's mined palladium, released data on Thursday showing its output of platinum group metals including palladium fell 13.5% in November compared to the same month in 2018.
On the demand side, emissions standards coming into force in number one car market China require 30% more palladium per vehicle, more than offsetting recent falls in numbers of vehicles sold, said Standard Chartered's Cooper.
Also helping boost prices, China and the United States signed a trade deal on Wednesday that could spur economic growth, and a Chinese auto industry group said vehicle sales would slow their decline.
Years of deficits have pushed down visible palladium stockpiles, with holdings in exchange traded funds (ETFs) at just over 600,000 ounces, down from 2.5 million ounces in mid-2015, removing a potential supply source.
(GRAPHIC - Palladium ETF holdings vs price: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8148/8130/2020%20PALLADIUM%20GRAPHIC%20ETFs.jpg)
Even as prices have surged, speculative investors have remained on the sidelines, limiting their power to disrupt the rally by cashing out of their bets.
But ever-more-rapid price rises look increasingly unsustainable, said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch, adding that technical indicators showed the market was overbought.
(GRAPHIC - Palladium technicals: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8151/8133/2020%20PALLADIUM%20GRAPHIC%20TECHNICALS.jpg)
Potential threats to high prices are if carmakers begin to replace palladium with platinum, which at around $1,000 an ounce now looks cheap, or miners bring forward new production.
""To me it looks like a bubble,"" said Fritsch, predicting prices would return to around $1,500 by the end of the year.
However, plenty are still betting on further gains, at least in the next year or two.
""Palladium is just going to go up and up and up,"" said Frederic Panizzutti at Swiss dealers MKS."

Smith took over as CEO of the group in September 2018, promising less than six months later to engineer efficiency gains through better-coordinated networks and fleets, after overcoming KLM resistance to closer integration with Air France.
""Are they operating as efficiently as I thought possible? No,"" Smith told the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris.
""Is there more to do? I think yes.""
Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) said in June that its separate Air France and KLM airline units would be swapping some remaining orders from Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIRF).
Organizing the order swap required aligning teams from pilots to training, Smith said. While each airline still has its own fleet team, he said, decisions need approval from the group board.
""We’ve elevated the decision-making process a bit earlier on, to ensure there’s more synergies.""
Air France KLM's operating margin came in at 4.8% for the first nine months of 2019, a 1.7 point decline from the same period a year earlier. The group has pledged to drive costs lower by speeding up the renewal of aircraft and streamlining the management of its combined fleet of more than 500 aircraft."

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) is cutting around 100 roles in its equities business with the bulk of the layoffs falling on its continental European trading floors, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The cuts will affect the bank's equities research, sales, trading and back office business departments, the sources said, and will include a handful of job losses in Asia.
HSBC said it could not provide a comment as the bank is in a closed period ahead of reporting full-year results for 2019.
The cuts to the bank's stock-trading business offer one of the clearest indications yet of the strategy interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn is likely to announce when the bank reports full-year results on Feb. 18.
Quinn took the reins in August following the shock ousting of John Flint, who quit after making insufficient progress in addressing some of the bank's long-term problems including underperformance in its investment bank and U.S. unit.
He has moved since to cut costs at Europe's biggest bank, saying in October last year the lender would slash some 4,700 roles. He is also looking to sell the bank's French retail business, and has reshuffled the top jobs at its investment bank.
The cuts to the equities business alongside the sale of the France unit show Asia-focused HSBC retreating further from its continental European business, despite recent efforts inside the bank to promote its European credentials. 
HSBC will refocus its European equities business on its core home market of Britain, the sources said, keeping its Paris trading hub to serve continental Europe.
HSBC's cuts in its equities business follow similar moves by European peers in recent years, as the digitalization of the business and regulations to protect investors have combined to slash banking margins.
HSBC rival  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) quit the business entirely in 2015 after it failed to make money for two years. 

HSBC has around 238,000 employees worldwide.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares rose to record highs on Friday, buoyed by Chinese growth figures that suggested the world's second-biggest economy was stabilizing. 
Riskier assets were in demand worldwide as the Chinese growth data, along with easing trade tensions with the United States, sent the MSCI world equity index up 0.2% and further into record territory. 
China's economy grew 6% between October and December last year. Anaemic domestic demand and the trade war with the United States led to growth of 6.1% in 2019, the slowest in 29 years.
But the data reinforced recent signs of an improvement in Chinese business confidence as trade tensions eased after Beijing and Washington signed an initial deal on Wednesday to defuse their tariff war. 
Investors were turning their attention to what many see as improved prospects for growth across the world. European shares gained 0.9% by late morning, with Frankfurt and Paris up around 0.7%. 
Shares in London, sensitive to currency moves, gained 0.9% after sterling slipped on signs of economic weakening that could prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates this month. 
Wall Street futures were also pointing up. 
The Chinese data fueled a rise in the Chinese yuan, which touch a six-month high of 6.8660 to the dollar. 
""Investors that were last year buying risky assets rather defensively - not really removing their hedging - right now are deploying cash,"" said Olivier Marciot, a portfolio manager at Unigestion. 
""A number of investors that were sitting on big piles of cash are starting reallocating. People are unloading cash positions into financial assets."" 
In France, however, protests against planned pension reforms started to hit major retailers. Supermarket Casino slumped as much as 12% after slashing its forecast for 2019 operating profit growth because of the damage from transport strikes in the fourth quarter. 
Asian markets also rose after the Chinese data, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gaining 0.3%. 
China's own blue-chip index ended 0.1% higher, down from an earlier rise of as much as 0.7%. The index has rallied more than 8.5% since the beginning of December, fueled by hopes for improved trade relations with the United States.
Shares in Australia and South Korea both rose, with Japan's Nikkei climbing to a 15-month high. 
""This is all good news and positive for the China story,"" said Daniel Gerard, senior multi-asset strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets in Hong Kong. 
MAINTAIN MOMENTUM?
Still, analysts say global equities may find it difficult to maintain momentum as optimism over the trade truce gives way to uncertainty over the next steps in trade talks. 
While the Phase 1 deal signed on Wednesday may defuse the 18-month trade row, analysts said it was unlikely to ease broader friction between the two countries. 
Most of the tariffs imposed during the dispute remain in place and a number of issues that sparked the conflict are still unresolved.
""The challenge from here is how long we can maintain these improvements,"" said Steven Daghlian, market analyst at CommSec in Sydney. 
In currency markets, sterling was last down 0.4% at $1.3020 as investors priced in a higher chance of an interest rate cut after weak retail sales data. 
Data this week suggesting weakness in inflation, growth and production numbers has raised the likelihood of a 25 basis point cut to rates in January to nearly 70%, according to Refinitiv data.
The dollar held steady, reaching eight-month highs against the yen after upbeat earnings from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), rising U.S. retail sales, a strong labor market and robust manufacturing data had on Thursday helped to lift Wall Street to record highs. (N)
Google's parent, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), became the fourth U.S. company to top a market value of more than $1 trillion. Its shares were up nearly 17% over the last three months. 
The index that tracks the dollar against a basket of six major rivals was last up 0.2 at 97.488.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 07:04AM ET</span>","Japan's MUFG replaces CEO after one year, digital chief to take helm","By Takashi Umekawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (T:8306) on Friday said it was replacing its CEO with its digital chief after one year, a rare move that illustrates the deepening urgency at Japan's biggest bank about the rise of fintech.
The elevation of Deputy President Hironori Kamezawa to the top spot marks a radical break from tradition for MUFG. The 58-year-old will become the first chief executive to have not previously headed the group's core unit, MUFG Bank. 
Outgoing CEO Kanetsugu Mike will become the group's deputy chairman and will remain as head of MUFG Bank. The changes will take effect in April.
Kamezawa's promotion, which was widely speculated in local media, shows how Japan's megabanks are looking to keep pace with more nimble fintech start-ups and the sweeping technological changes that are altering global finance.
""The business environment surrounding the financial industry has changed a lot with the entry of other types of firms into the sector,"" Kamezawa told a news conference.
""Some investors have been quite harsh, pointing out, for example, our low share price. I'd like to pour my strength into outlining how we are going to achieve future growth with our next mid-term plan,"" he said.
With $2.8 trillion in assets, MUFG is one of the world's biggest banks. It also owns 24% of Wall Street lender  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).
But despite its massive heft - MUFG is roughly the size of the British economy - it suffers from the common ailments of Japanese banks: years of ultra-low interest rates and a shrinking economy and population at home.
MUFG's total return, the measure of share performance that includes dividends, was 11.7% over the last five years, well below the benchmark Nikkei index (N225), which returned 55% when dividends were included.
Its return on equity is 5.4%, well short of global rivals such as JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) which had a return on equity of 14.9%.
TOUGH NUT TO CRACK
""With the rising customers' needs of fintech, it is essential for banks to promote the strategy of digitalization,"" said Ryoji Yoshizawa, a senior director at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings.
""This personnel change reflects their sense of urgency over this and so should not be a surprise."" 
But digital has so far proved a tough nut to crack for Japanese banks, whose apps and on-line banking services are often clunky and hard to navigate.
What is clear, though, is that Japan's big banks themselves recognize the need for change, pointing to digitalization as a way to cut costs and boost profits.

In its current mid-term business plan through fiscal 2020, MUFG set 11 priorities, including digitalization, as key areas for structural reform.

 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) affiliate Ant, which had an implied valuation of $150 billion during a 2018 fundraising, is preparing to step up plans for eventually going public in Hong Kong and mainland China, three other sources told Reuters.
Speculation has grown that Ant, the world's largest so-called ""unicorn"" -- a newly-formed unlisted tech firm valued at $1 billion or more -- is working toward an IPO this year.
Its advisers have recently approached potential buyers of the unlisted shares, the first two people said, as Ant seeks to tidy up its shareholder base ahead of any listing.
An Ant Financial spokesman said the company does not have a plan or timetable for an intial public offering (IPO).
Small holdings of Ant shares were traded in the secondary market at a $200 billion valuation late last year, another person familiar with the situation said. All of the people declined to comment due to confidentiality restrictions.
Investors worldwide are scrutinizing valuations for ""unicorns"" more closely after last year's collapse in value of the once-hyped office space provider WeWork.
Some Ant investors packaged their shares into wealth management products so may not technically still hold them all, potentially complicating regulatory approval for an IPO.
Some executives are also selling some of their shares which are held via limited partnership schemes controlled by Alibaba founder Jack Ma, one of the first two sources said.
Under listing rules for domestic IPOs, the controlling shareholder or the actual controller of a company is subject to a three-year lock-up period.
Hangzhou-based Ant runs Alibaba's payment business Alipay and offers savings and credit products to Alipay users. Last year Alibaba switched its rights to 37.5% of Ant's pre-tax profits for a one-third shareholding.
Alibaba says Alipay and its local e-wallet partners have about 1.2 billion annual active users, of which 900 million were in China.
In the first nine months of 2019, Ant paid Alibaba 4.35 billion yuan ($634 million) in royalty fees and software service fees, regulatory filings show. Based on Alibaba's profit sharing arrangement with Ant prior to the swap, Ant's pre-tax profit for those months would be roughly 11.6 billion yuan.
FLUID PLANS
Ant has quietly brought back together many of its corporate finance team, some of whom had moved to other roles in recent years. The moves are seen as a sign it wants to progress with preparations for a float, two people close to the company said.
And during a recent meeting with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), China's market regulator, Ant discussed its IPO prospects along with other matters, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
But any plans are still extremely fluid, seven sources with knowledge of the process said.
China has essentially blocked quasi-financial companies from going public as part of a broader crackdown on financial risks for the past three years - a rule that also applies to Ant, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
Ant had not yet made progress in getting approval from the CSRC for an IPO, the source added.
The CSRC did not respond to a request for comment.
Ant, which has applied for a Singapore digital banking license, has been expanding its payment business internationally and investing in similar businesses in Southeast Asia and Europe."

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets are set to open higher Friday, with investors reveling in a combination of healthy corporate earnings, diminished external growth risks and healthy domestic economic data.
Futures for theS&P 500 were trading 8 points, or 0.3%, higher by 11:55 AM ET (11:55 GMT), futures for the NASDAQ Composite were 34 points, or 0.4%, higher, while the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was up 80 points, or 0.3%. 
On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 0.8%, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 0.9%. All three major averages ended the day in record territory, while a total of 64 S&P 500 components hit all-time highs.
The threat of a trade war between the globe’s two largest economic powers has been lessened with the signing of the Sino-U.S. deal and the latest Chinese growth data suggest its slowdown may have come to an end. Thus investors have turned their attention to more domestic matters. 
The earnings season has been pretty healthy so far, although it’s been the banking sector which has mainly reported. Additionally, Wednesday’s retail sales suggested the U.S. consumer remains buoyant.
Focus will now turn to Friday’s batch of economic data releases. 
The housing market will kick things off, with the December measure of housing starts and building permits due at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
At 9:15 AM ET, the Fed will release December figures on industrial production and capacity utilization, and the University of Michigan will report its preliminary measure of January consumer sentiment at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT). At the same time the Labor Department issues its November job openings numbers.
There’ll also be speeches from Philly Fed President Patrick Harker at 9 AM and banking supervision head Randal Quarles at 12:45 PM.
Financial earnings keep on arriving, with   State Street   (NYSE:STT) hoping to continue the strong numbers the majority of the banks have reported. Elsewhere, energy services giant Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) reported revenue and earnings both slightly ahead of expectations.
At 5:00 AM ET (12:00 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $58.88 and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.7% to $65.08. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX climbed 0.4% to $1,556.25."
208,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 06:39AM ET</span>",Boeing Is Way Behind Airbus in Race for China’s Next Big Order,"(Bloomberg) -- The long-awaited trade agreement between the U.S. and China may pave the way for   Boeing Co   (NYSE:BA) to resume sales to the world’s second-largest aviation market, but the American giant has much catching up to do against European archrival Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR).
China Aviation Supplies Holding Co., which buys planes on behalf of the nation’s airlines, has been in talks with Airbus since 2019 about purchasing jets for the country’s next five-year economic plan that begins in 2021, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named discussing a private matter. Those talks began early last year, one of the people said. China’s top economic planner, which needs to clear negotiations of this magnitude, hasn’t even authorized the state procurement firm to begin talks with Boeing yet as trade tensions held back discussions, the person said.
This means the Chicago-based aircraft maker is at least months behind Airbus in securing orders from China, which Boeing estimates will need more than 8,000 planes in the next two decades. Boeing is still reeling from the grounding of its best-selling 737 Max planes, which resulted in the company delivering fewer than half of the planes that Airbus did last year, the biggest defeat in the industry’s 45-year duopoly.
Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun on Wednesday voiced optimism that Boeing will continue to have a valued relationship with China. A representative at the company declined to comment beyond what the new CEO said. The National Development and Reform Commission, which is China’s main economic planner, and China Aviation Supplies didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Airbus declined to comment.
Things may be looking up for Boeing. Aircraft were among the $200 billion in American purchases that China pledged to make as part of a phase-one accord, though details weren’t disclosed. Also, it’s unlikely that China would shun Boeing entirely because the country has historically split its orders evenly between the two manufacturers, Airbus doesn’t have the capacity to meet all of China’s needs and such a drastic move would require thousands of pilots to be retrained.
Trade tensions have hindered Boeing’s ability to capitalize on surging demand from a country that’s expected to become the world’s largest aviation market in the coming years. China will need to spend $2.9 trillion on new aircraft and ground services over the next two decades, Boeing predicted in September.
The talks with Airbus are separate from an already-announced commitment from China to buy $35 billion worth of the Toulouse-based company’s jets, according to the people.
In China, which led the grounding of the 737 Max, airplane purchases need to be cleared by regulators before they are handed off to China Aviation Supplies. Sales are then often recorded as coming from unidentified customers by Boeing and Airbus, and may be unveiled at various stages of the approvals process."
209,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",Low inventories to frustrate zinc bears,"By Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - Historically low stocks of zinc in London Metal Exchange registered warehouses are likely to fuel price volatility and confound those investors looking at an oversupplied market and expecting significantly lower prices.
Stocks of zinc in LME warehouses are close to 20-year lows at around 50,000 tonnes, having been on a downtrend since October 2015 when mining giant  Glencore  (L:GLEN) shut 500,000 tonnes of capacity because of low prices.
The low stocks come at a time when many market participants are expecting to see a supply surplus this year after several years of deficits, which would be bearish for prices of the metal used to galvanise steel.
(Graphic: Zinc market balance click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8144/8126/Zinc%20market%20balance.png)
Those betting on lower prices - short positions - will typically sell and buy it back at a lower price before the contract matures or make a physical delivery. But low stocks mean a shortage of zinc on the LME market.
""The scramble to cover shorts mean price spikes even though there is no real shortage,"" said a Europe-based zinc trader.
""LME inventories are artificially low, there are stocks off exchange, but higher prices are needed for that metal to turn up in exchange inventories.""
(Graphic: Zinc prices click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8147/8129/zinc%20prices.png)
Zinc prices , at around $2,400, have tumbled nearly 20% since April 2019's $2,958 as supplies of concentrate climbed due to new mines such as Vedanta's Gamsberg and MMG's (HK:1208) Dugald River.
""Lower prices will be needed to put a brake on supply,"" said Citi analyst Oliver Nugent. ""Surplus concentrate means revenue is moving from miners to smelters.""
Treatment charges, or the fees that miners pay smelters to process ore into refined metal, have climbed to around $300 a tonne on the spot market from $20 a tonne in 2018.
(Graphic: Zinc treatment charges click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8146/8128/Zinc%20treatment%20charges.png)
""Mine supply is rising,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analyst Michael Widmer said.
""Inventories have fallen to levels that tend to be accompanied by disorderly movements in time spreads.""
Time spreads are a reference to price differentials for contracts with different maturities.
The widely watched cash over the three-month contract is at a premium or backwardation near $20 a tonne, from a discount in December, which typically should attract more metal to the exchange and its warehouses.
Higher premiums are needed for trade houses, holding large amounts of zinc, to warrant metal.
(Graphic: Zinc spreads click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8145/8127/Zinc%20cash%20to%20threes.png)
Tight nearby supplies on the LME market pushed the premium to a 22-year high above $160 a tonne in May 2019.
Visible inventories including those on the LME, in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange and those held by producers are estimated at round 1.1 million tonnes.
""That's about 30 days' consumption, 40 days would be adequate and 50 days normal,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Andrew Thomas.
Thomas said Chinese smelters have in previous years processed surplus concentrate but he doesn't expect that to happen now as economic growth and demand are weak.
""They can't afford to stockpile metal ... environmental issues mean they don't crank out metal the way they used to.""
Global zinc consumption is around 14 million tonnes.

210,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",Volatility Strategists on 2020: ‘Markets Yet to Feel the Bern’,"(Bloomberg) -- Small-cap shares are a good hedge for potential downturns, volatility strategists say.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG adds that investors who aren’t “feeling” Bernie Sanders’s prospects risk being blindsided by the U.S. election.
But overall, stock swings shouldn’t impress.
UBS Group AG strategist Stuart Kaiser predicts realized volatility on the S&P 500 Index will drop from about 19% in the first half of the year to 12% in the second half as growth trends turn positive and inflation momentum goes negative. Credit Suisse strategist Mandy Xu says it’ll average 13% over 2020 given that the Federal Reserve is on hold and likely to ease further if downside risks materialize. The VIX’s mean will be 15, Xu predicts, down slightly from 15.4 in 2019.
“Policy risks or a more significant growth slowdown are needed to shift volatility notably higher,” Kaiser wrote in his 2020 outlook Wednesday.
That doesn’t mean they see a boring year.
“While trade risk has receded, geopolitical risks have emerged,” Xu wrote on Monday. “From the 2020 U.S. election to ongoing tensions in the Middle East, a number of catalysts could drive the VIX to excess of 25.”
Xu and Kaiser like hedges on the iShares Russell 2000 exchange-traded fund. A slowdown in the economy could have a bigger effect on shares of small companies, which are highly cyclical and affected by trade tensions, Kaiser said, adding that his firm’s growth outlook for the first half of the year is below consensus.
Cantor Fitzgerald LP chief market strategist Peter Cecchini agrees.
“We not only prefer Russell 2000 put spreads to the S&P 500,” he wrote Thursday, “we are now high conviction that long-ish dated Russell put spreads are a must to any high-yield or equity portfolio with significant long exposure. The volatility surface allows hedged investors to effectively implement downside strategies in risk asset markets, which have generally lost their minds.”
Tallbacken Capital Advisors LLC’s Michael Purves, however, advocates hedges on the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF or the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund as opposed to the Russell 2000 ETF. Small caps are among sectors that “have a lot of catch-up to do,” he said Thursday, while there are hints of “an early stage of a pivot” lower in momentum for semiconductors.
Trading the Election
Then there’s the U.S. election, which Kaiser says is “more tactical than structural” as a market event. He recommends trades like one- to three-month puts on the S&P 500.
“We don’t expect the election alone to drive a regime shift in realized volatility,” he wrote. “We see the election as more of a tactical trade in the run-up to Election Day.”
Xu points particularly to the Democratic primary as a potential surprise, given that volatility appears to be more affected by Elizabeth Warren’s poll numbers than those of Sanders, who is currently in a strong position in surveys.
Volatility markets are “yet to feel the Bern,” she wrote, noting that long-dated volatility on assets like managed-care stocks “normalized with Warren’s fall in the polls. Yet investors seem to be forgetting about Bernie…”
Trades from UBS include:
Upside in Germany or Hong Kong in case of a risk/growth reboundGo long the Japanese yen in case U.S. growth slows and risk markets come under pressureShort oil volatility; selling upside on United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) “is attractive”Trades from Credit Suisse include:
Sell a June put on the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 to buy a call spread on the firm’s view of improving margin headwinds and strong earnings growthFor a cheap upside play, buy the S&P 500 June 103% call contingent on the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) fund being above 103% at expirationFor a macro risk-off hedge, try a June Euro Stoxx 50 95% put contingent on the euro/dollar pair being below 1.09, as that the region’s equities and currency tend to move together during periods of market stress"
211,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 06:22AM ET</span>",Indonesian minister says SoftBank offering to invest up to $40 billion in new capital,"By Bernadette Christina
JAKARTA (Reuters) - SoftBank has offered to invest up to $40 billion in the new capital city Indonesia plans to build on Borneo island, a minister said on Friday, though the Japanese tech conglomerate said no figure had been suggested yet.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo announced in August plans to move the administrative capital to East Kalimantan province, on Borneo, to relieve Jakarta from ""a heavy burden"" due to overcrowding and pollution.
Indonesia has previously put the cost of moving the capital at $33 billion, but Luhut Pandjaitan, Indonesia's coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment, said Softbank Group Corp had offered up to $40 billion.
""So we'll negotiate over the structure (of the investment). It could amount to $30-40 billion,"" he told reporters.
A spokeswoman for SoftBank said the group had not suggested specific numbers, echoing comments by CEO and founder Masayoshi Son last week.
""We're not discussing the specific numbers yet, but a new smart city, newest technology, clean city, with a lot of AI (artificial intelligence), that's what I'm interested in supporting,” Son said during a visit to Jakarta last week.
Pandjaitan said he would discuss the potential investment further with Son further on Monday at the World Economic Forum gathering in the Swiss resort of Davos and that President Joko Widodo will likely decide on the agreement in February.
Widodo said on Thursday that a planned sovereign wealth fund to finance infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy will raise at least $20 billion once established, though Pandjaitan said it was still under discussion whether investment would be channeled through the sovereign wealth fund.
Widodo discussed plans to establish the fund with Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed al-Nahyan last weekend during an official visit to the United Arab Emirates.
Sovereign wealth funds are typically used by countries to direct funds from resource wealth such as oil, though Indonesia also plans to invite foreign investment into its fund.
To help attract investment, Indonesia has asked Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Softbank's Son to advise on plans to move the capital, ministers have said.
Planning minister Suharso Monoarfa said this week that Softbank was interested in providing self-driving vehicles for the capital.
In June, the self-driving car joint venture of SoftBank and Toyota Motor said it plans to begin operating in Southeast Asia this year."
212,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>","After India's Amazon snub, Modi's party slams Bezos-owned Washington Post","By Sankalp Phartiyal and Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party on Friday slammed editorial policies of billionaire Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post, even as his e-commerce firm Amazon (O:AMZN) announced plans to create a million jobs in the country by 2025.
Vijay Chauthaiwale, the chief of the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) foreign affairs department, said there was ""a lot of problem"" with the newspaper's coverage of India, without giving any specific examples.
The swipe at the Post came a day after a cabinet minister gave short shrift to Amazon's (O:AMZN) investment plans for India.
Bezos has praised India during his ongoing visit, saying the 21st century will be the Indian century and that the dynamism and energy in the country was ""something special"".
""I am not opposing Amazon as a company, in fact I am a regular customer ... Jeff Bezos should go home tell Washington Post what is his impression about India,"" Chauthaiwale told Reuters.
""The Washington Post editorial policy is highly biased and agenda driven.""
Washington Post's India bureau chief, Joanna Slater, referred a Reuters request for comment to the newspaper's spokespersons in Washington, who did not immediately respond outside regular business hours.
Chauthaiwale has in the past been critical of foreign media's reporting on political issues, including on the disputed region of Kashmir which is claimed by both India and Pakistan, saying coverage has been biased against Modi.
Amazon did not respond to an email seeking comment on Chauthaiwale's remarks. 
In Amazon's statement on Friday announcing the job-creation plans, Bezos said ""we're excited about what lies ahead"", but street protests this week by small retailers and adverse comments from politicians have made Bezos' visit a public relations nightmare for Amazon.
India's shopkeepers have represented a core constituency for the BJP since the early days of the party. And sources told Reuters that Modi, who has otherwise courted foreign investors, was unlikely to meet Bezos during his visit despite repeated requests by the company in light of traders' concerns and an ongoing antitrust probe. 
SOURING SENTIMENT
India last year enforced stringent rules for foreign investment in e-commerce which forced Amazon to rework its business structures and strained ties between New Delhi and Washington.
In recent months, the government has said it is concerned about issues raised by India's brick-and-mortar retailers who say they've been hit by Amazon and Walmart's (N:WMT) Flipkart which flout regulations and burn billions of dollars to offer steep discounts. The companies deny the allegations.
India's antitrust body this week launched a probe into both Amazon and Flipkart.
On Thursday, Bezos attended a company event in Mumbai with Bollywood actors such as Shah Rukh Khan and said the company would ""double down"" its investments on its video streaming service, Prime Video.
But the event was largely overshadowed by comments made by India's trade minister Piyush Goyal, who raised questions about the company's business practices while addressing a security conference in New Delhi and said Amazon had done no big favor to India by announcing a new $1 billion investment. 
Industry executives and their advisers told Reuters on Friday that Goyal's remarks were likely to put off foreign investors, denting India's economic growth which is already projected to fall to a 11-year low this year.

""This clearly is unbecoming, and it will hurt how the world views India as a destination,"" said a senior executive of a U.S.-based company operating in India.

LONDON (Reuters) - Struggling British regional airline Flybe is in talks with the government about a loan on commercial terms which would not represent a state bailout, the BBC reported on Friday.
British Airways (L:ICAG) and Ryanair (I:RYA) have opposed government-backed support for Flybe, saying it prevents a level playing field and breaches state aid rules, although the details of the plan have not been made public.
The government has said that its support for Flybe, which provides links between many regional UK and European airports, does not breach EU rules on state aid.
Flybe's boss Mark Anderson said any government help would be made on commercial terms, the BBC reported, citing an address he gave to Flybe staff.
""We are in conversation with the government around a financial loan - a loan, not a bailout - a commercial loan, but that is the same as any loan we'd take from any bank,"" the BBC quoted Anderson as saying.
Flybe was rescued from near collapse on Tuesday, when its shareholders agreed to invest more money alongside government.
The airline declined to comment on the BBC's report of what Anderson said, but did say that it had agreed with Britain's finance department a payment plan for a debt of less than 10 million pounds ($13.1 million). 
""This agreement will only last a matter of months before all taxes and duties are paid in full. This is a standard 'Time to Pay' arrangement with HMRC that any business in financial difficulties may use,"" a spokesman for Flybe said in an email.
Flybe is owned by Connect Airways, a consortium created by Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group (L:STOB) and investment adviser Cyrus Capital. They bought the struggling airline last year and have already provided it with 110 million pounds of funding. 
But the airline's losses were such that the new funding was used up quickly, Anderson is reported to have said. 
""Three-quarters of the money the shareholders invested was gone before we even really started. That has hurt this business and more money is needed,"" the BBC quoted Anderson as saying. 
But he tried to reassure staff about Flybe's future.
""We are not making millions of profit at the moment but if we stick to the plan, and what we have to do, we will,"" he said. 

UK Infrastructure company Stobart said on Thursday it was providing 9 million pounds of funding for Flybe as part of this week's government-backed deal.

""I am looking forward to .... building on the great work of Hans to further advance the group's transformation, harness the significant opportunities ahead to drive profitable growth, and deliver clear value for stakeholders,"" Williams said in a statement.
Adecco wished Ploos van Amstel well, saying he had helped improve the company's cost structure, adjust its portfolio and roll out digital offerings.
Williams' departure from Pearson was announced on Thursday alongside a profit warning that sent its shares to their lowest level in more than a decade.
It comes a month after CEO John Fallon said he would retire this year.
The British education group has been caught off guard by the speed of the switch from physical textbooks to digital products, resulting in a string of profit warnings.
Williams will be succeeded at Pearson by his deputy, Sally Johnson, Pearson said."

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets hit new record highs on Friday morning as data out of China suggested that the world’s second-largest economy is bottoming out.
Comments from EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan suggesting an easing of tension between the EU and U.S. also lifted sentiment, even though the sensitive auto sector, which has most to lose from the U.S. import tariffs previously threatened by President Donald Trump, didn’t notably outperform.
By 5:10 AM ET (1010 GMT) the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.9% at 424.24. The German DAX likewise flirted with a new record high before retreating modestly to be up 0.9%.
Utility RWE (DE:RWEG) was the biggest gainer, posting new five-year highs after Thursday’s breakthrough regarding compensation for its coal assets. Signs of progress in German energy policy also pulled up E.ON (DE:EONGn) by 1.7%. They both paled in comparison, however, to the 7% rise in Electricite de France SA (PA:EDF), which followed a report outlining plans to ensure its covers the cost of developing new nuclear plants and decommissioning old ones.
Another big gainer was luxury group   Richemont   (SIX:CFR), which lost its status as the world’s largest high-end jeweller with the acquisition of Tiffany by LVMH (PA:LVMH) at the end of last year.
The company behind Cartier and Van Cleef saw its shares rise 4.9% after the company said sales in the three months through December rose 4% in constant exchange rates, with strong performances in EMEA and the Americas offsetting what it called a “marked contraction” in China and Hong Kong. U.S. sales rose 5%, while groupwide jewellery sales rose 9%.
There was less good news from the retail sector, as supermarket chain   Casino   Guichard and electronics retailer FNAC both warned about the impact on their business from the sustained wave of strikes in France against President Macron’s planned pension reforms. FNAC (PA:FNAC) fell 8.9% to its lowest in nearly five years, while Casino (PA:CASP) stock fell 7.7% to its lowest in five months.
Elsewhere, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) was the best-performing auto stock after a report saying it was in talks to buy a stake in a battery-producing company in China, which would be the first acquisition in that space for the company in its epic shift away from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles."

(Reuters) - Private healthcare provider NMC Health (L:NMC), hurt by short-selling by Muddy Waters, said on Friday an independent review committee looking into the matter had hired FBI ex-boss Louis Freeh.
NMC, the United Arab Emirates' largest private healthcare provider, launched an independent review of its finances last month after short-seller Muddy Waters questioned the value of its assets and cash balance while announcing a short position.
Since Muddy Waters' claims were launched on Dec. 17, NMC has lost 2.4 billion pounds ($3.14 billion) of its share value, or 44%. 
Its shares leapt 6.4% on Friday to 1,533 pence, leading London's bluechip index (FTSE), after news that Freeh, who probed  BP  (L:BP) oil spill claims payouts, would take charge of the investigation.
Short selling involves borrowing an asset and selling it with the aim of buying it back at a cheaper price for profit. Muddy Waters, founded by American Carson Block, is known in financial markets for declaring short equity positions on the basis of its in-house research. 
Muddy Waters also questioned the value of NMC's reported profits and debts. The short-seller also said in a research note that NMC's asset purchase prices and capital expenditures were inflated.
NMC has called the report ""false and misleading"" and has defended its position.
The company suffered another setback after the attack by Muddy Waters as two major shareholders launched a discounted share sale in NMC earlier this month.
The healthcare firm's vice-chairman Khaleefa Al Muhairi and its second-largest shareholder Saeed Al Qebaisi together sold NMC shares worth 375 million British pounds ($490.54 million) and a source told Reuters that the sale price factored in context around Muddy Waters. 
FBI HEAVYWEIGHT
NMC said the independent committee has also hired Freeh's risk management firm FGIS to look at the allegations.
""The committee chose Freeh Group to provide a completely independent, unbiased, comprehensive and transparent report that will address all of these allegations,"" Jonathan Bomford, chairman of the independent review committee, said. 
Freeh, who ran the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1993 until June 2001, has handled multiple high-profile probes including possible misconduct by a lawyer involved in settlement payments to those affected by the Gulf of Mexico spill in 2010 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-spill-claims/former-fbi-director-freeh-to-probe-bp-spill-claims-payouts-idUSBRE9611A720130702.
However, his tenure as director of the FBI also attracted criticism https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crime-coach-freeh/penn-state-investigator-freeh-had-rocky-fbi-tenure-idUSTRE7AK1KH20111121?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews.
The strongest backlash of Freeh's tenure came from the commission that investigated the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
The NMC committee intends to publish findings of its review before NMC reports its 2019 results.
Muddy Waters did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside U.S. business hours.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 04:52AM ET</span>",'Green is good.' Is Wall Street's new motto sustainable?,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you have gone to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc's (N:GS) internet home page since mid-December, it would be reasonable to wonder if you had stumbled into some kind of parallel universe.
Visitors are met with a background of lush greenery, along with a banner headline: “Our Commitment to Sustainable Finance.”
The company recently announced a $750 billion, 10-year initiative in nine different areas such as clean energy, affordable education and accessible healthcare, and overhauled lending policies to exclude ventures like new Arctic drilling.
At first glance it might seem like the famously hard-charging Wall Street investment bank was feeling, well, not quite itself.
After all, Goldman Sachs has not always endeared itself to critics of Wall Street. One journalist, Matt Taibbi, famously called it the “Vampire Squid,” with its arms “wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.”
So what is going on, if even Goldman Sachs is going green?
The $750 billion commitment is earmarked for investing in, financing, and advising companies that are pursuing sustainable goals - for instance, taking steps to reduce carbon emissions. Behind Goldman Sachs' efforts is essentially one guy, John Goldstein - known as the “Forrest Gump” of the field, since he keeps popping up at key moments - who sold his firm, Impact Capital Advisors, to Goldman in 2015.
“Large companies are pushing sustainability up and down their supply chains. Governments are getting more active and engaged. You’re seeing it everywhere,"" said Goldstein, now head of the firm’s Sustainable Finance Group, which was formed last July. “You can see and feel the acceleration going on.""
TIPPING POINT
Goldman Sachs is hardly alone when it comes to big financial institutions buying into sustainability in a serious way. Up until recently, ESG investing - managing money according to environmental, social, and governance factors - has been seen as a niche interest of investors. It is still challenging, for instance, to find ESG options within many U.S. employers' 401(k) plans.
But big financial players are starting to move the needle on sustainability issues. Investment giant BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and its $7 trillion in assets just joined the Climate Action 100+ initiative, pressuring companies to act on climate issues.  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) is another leader in the field, as a longtime and vocal supporter of the Paris Agreement, the landmark environmental accord of 2016. The firm created its Environmental Finance Goal back in 2015, devoting $100 billion to climate change solutions in areas like clean energy, infrastructure and technology.
“The climate issue is not going away, and it’s only going to get worse,” said Lauren Compere, managing director at Boston Common Asset Management, who authored a recent report on how the world’s biggest financial firms are handling environmental issues.
As big institutions go green, it can make for strange bedfellows, like some of Goldstein’s clients who were carried into the Goldman Sachs fold. Among them, a group of Midwestern nuns known as the Franciscan Sisters of Mary, a Roman Catholic group out of St. Louis.
They divested from fossil fuels before most other investors had even thought about doing so. In fact they were such early adopters of the sustainability trend that they literally had to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) someone who could help them invest in the manner they envisioned.
But the nuns seem to have found a home at Goldman Sachs, just as Goldstein did, poring over reports they are sent about the impact they are having around the world. Among their investments: A number of ESG-oriented funds, as well as direct private investments such as a solar energy provider for low-income households in Kenya.
Of course, Goldman Sachs’ interest in sustainability is not altruistic: It is a reflection of the fact that this is where business is headed - investing for return while not destroying our collective home. Just witness the growth in managed assets for Goldstein and his group - from $550 million when they were acquired, to $6 billion in 2016, $11 billion in 2017, $17 billion in 2018, and north of $55 billion in 2019.
Globally, sustainable and impact investing has skyrocketed to $12 trillion as of 2018, a 38% increase in two years, according to the US SIF Foundation. And if that investment trend has made for some peculiar alliances, so be it.
“I’m in a place that I wouldn’t have imagined was possible,” said Goldstein. “But the fact that I’ve been along for that ride, and I’m still here, speaks for itself.”

221,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 04:52AM ET</span>",Which company just hit $1 trillion? Google it.,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc became on Thursday the fourth U.S. company to top a market value of more than $1 trillion, some funds holding its shares are wondering whether now is the time to cash in on the stock's extraordinary gains.
Shares of the Internet search giant are up nearly 17% over the last three months, outpacing a broader rally in the S&P 500 index over the same period by 6 percentage points.
Short interest in the stock, a measure of how many investors are betting on a price decline, is at 1%, near a 52-week high for the company and higher than competitors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), according to Refinitv data.
Alphabet joins Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft as the only U.S. companies to hit $1 trillion in market value.
""Google is a stock that won't get you fired,"" said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds who hasn't added to his current Alphabet position since the first quarter of 2019. “Will I be able to double my money in this stock from here? I'm not sure about that.”
Alphabet's shares are among a small group of stocks found in the top holdings of both mutual funds and hedge funds, two types of institutions whose investing styles tend to be markedly different, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysis showed. That could leave it exposed to volatile price swings if sentiment suddenly changes. 
Despite those concerns, many investors are finding it hard to say goodbye. The 28% climb in Alphabet and the performance of other technology and tech-related stocks helped money managers post big gains in 2019, making it difficult for many to justify cutting their exposure even as they fret over the implications of its run-up. 
Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager of the BMO Large-Cap Growth Fund, has held onto his shares, betting that Alphabet’s exposure to online advertising will eventually justify its above-average valuation. Alphabet trades at 26.6 times future earnings, compared with 18.5 for the S&P 500. 
Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager of the Biondo Focus fund, has held off adding to a longstanding position over the last year, concerned that the company's costs are likely to increase due to its efforts to pre-empt any additional regulatory measures from Washington. That could cut into the margins of businesses like YouTube if it needs to hire additional workers to vet user-posted content, he said.
Alphabet is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 3. In its latest report, the company missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue expectations. That news did little to dent investors' bullishness on the company: Alphabet's stock retreated briefly on the report, only to resume its climb several days later.

Bearish investors, however, can point to Amazon.com, which saw its market value fall below $1 trillion after its streak of record profits ended in July. Shares of the company are down nearly 7% over the last six months, compared with a 10% gain in the S&P 500 overall.

The pan STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose as much as 0.8% to a record high of 423.80, and was set to mark its best week since late-December.
Hogan said on Thursday that he had a good exchange of views with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington, underscoring Brussels' desire to negotiate solutions for several open trade disputes between the United States and the EU.
The meeting is a step forward in addressing long-standing issues such as a French digital tax and aircraft subsidies.
It also added to investor optimism after the United States and China signed an interim trade deal earlier in the week.
""The positive comments surrounding one of the United States' other trade conflicts - with the EU - it just adds to the overall feeling of relief,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at British financial spread better Spreadex.
Campbell also said that signs of improvement in the Chinese economy following an in-line GDP figure and strong industrial production data was helping risk appetite, with demand in the world's second-largest economy looking to pick up in 2020.

Sales grew by 1.3% to 1.94 million units in Europe but fell 17.2% in China. Sales also fell by 19.3% in Africa, Middle East, India and the Pacific region, Renault said in a statement.
Renault has suffered since August 2018 from the closure of the Iranian market where the company sold had around 101,000 vehicles, which it was not able to do last year.
In 2019, sales were also down 44.5% in Argentina and -26.5% in Turkey.

224,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>",India Snubs $1 Billion Amazon Investment as Resentment Grows,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s government has scoffed at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos’ offer to invest $1 billion in the country, firing the latest salvo at an e-commerce giant that’s been accused of predatory business practices.
Trade minister Piyush Goyal delivered a stinging rebuke two days after Bezos arrived in New Delhi and touted his efforts to help digitize small and medium enterprises. The investment would bring Amazon’s bet on the Indian market to about $6.5 billion. Goyal told a gathering of foreign ministers from around the world he welcomed an investigation into the company’s alleged “predatory pricing and unfair trade practices.”
“They may have put in a billion dollars,” Goyal said at the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi on Thursday. “But then if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year, then they jolly well have to finance that billion dollars. So it’s not as if they are doing a great favor to India when they invest a billion dollars.”
Bezos has attracted significant opposition during a tour of India intended to underscore its importance as a growth driver for Amazon. The country’s antitrust regulator initiated a formal investigation hours before his arrival, and retailers affiliated with the Confederation of All India Traders organized sit-ins and public rallies in multiple cities to protest Amazon’s traditional cut-price approach and exclusive-selling practices.
Outside the venue of Amazon India’s annual event for small retailers Wednesday, demonstrators held banners proclaiming “Amazon, go back!” and with Bezos’ face crossed-out. The CEO has sought a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi but that hasn’t come through.
Amazon has sought to counter the negativity with a PR offensive. From Delhi, Bezos went on to Mumbai where he visited a neighborhood store. It’s these small stores that are up in arms against the retail behemoth. The chief executive then rubbed shoulders with Bollywood personalities -- Amazon is plowing money into creating Bollywood-dominated content for its Prime Video service to lure movie-mad Indians. On Friday, the company declared it planned to create a million jobs within the country by 2025. The retail giant said it had already created 700,000 jobs in six years of operating its marketplace there.
Increasing Hostility
Still, Goyal’s comments were an indication that Modi’s government is trying to safeguard the interests of smaller Indian traders, the traditional voter base of his Bharatiya Janata Party, as elections approach in the state of Delhi, home to the country’s capital.
Soon after Goyal spoke, the chief of his party’s foreign cell, Vijay Chauthaiwale, tweeted barely-veiled criticism of the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos. The U.S. newspaper has been criticized by the BJP and its allies for its coverage of the Modi government’s increasingly right-wing policies.
The flare-up suggests India is turning increasingly hostile to the monopolistic practices of foreign e-commerce players that dominate the burgeoning market. Responding to widespread complaints, India restricted foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail and this has forced Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.’s Flipkart, the two biggest e-commerce players in India, to overhaul business models to comply with new rules introduced in December 2018.
In 2016, New Delhi had said foreign-owned e-commerce platforms could operate as marketplaces -- facilitating transactions between sellers and consumers -- but not sell directly. Flipkart and Amazon had established wholesale networks to reach their customers. But the more recent regulations target this workaround, banning foreign e-commerce sites from selling goods from companies in which they own a stake or have commercial arrangements with.
Yet resentment toward Amazon and Walmart lingers. On Thursday, Goyal also questioned why an e-commerce marketplace should make losses.
“Anybody who tries to use the e-commerce marketplace model to get into the multi-brand retail space surreptitiously will have to be questioned, will have to be investigated,” Goyal said.

225,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 03:15AM ET</span>",Inside Tesla’s Attack on Germany’s Auto Establishment,"(Bloomberg) -- German rangers stand guard to shoo away visitors from a nondescript stretch of forest near Berlin, where a sign nearby warns of “Lebensgefahr” (mortal danger).
The precautions are part of the frantic activity underway to set up Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) latest assembly plant, Elon Musk’s most daring attack on the German auto establishment. Workers wielding metal detectors have started combing through an area covering some 200 football fields to search for errant ammunition lurking beneath the sandy surface of tiny Gruenheide.
It’s the first stage to prepare a site that could churn out as many as 500,000 cars a year, employ 12,000 people and pose a serious challenge to Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p),   Daimler   AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG (DE:BMWG). Once deemed free of World War II explosives, harvesters and trucks will roll in to clear thousands of trees in the first stage of development. The work needs to be done by the end of February to meet Tesla’s aggressive timetable.
 The project represents a second chance for the quiet town, nestled between two lakes on the edge of a nature reserve southeast of Berlin.
Gruenheide lost out on a similar factory two decades ago, when BMW opted for Leipzig. That missed opportunity helped town officials to move quickly when Tesla expressed interest in building its first European factory in Germany, with a plot set aside for industrial use and offering easy access to the Autobahn and rail lines.
“The investment is a unique opportunity,” Mayor Arne Christiani said in his office, where a map of the Tesla project hangs on the wall. “It gives young people with a good education or a university degree the possibility to stay in our region—an option that didn’t exist in past years.”
If it clears Germany’s red tape, the plant will make batteries, powertrains and vehicles, including the Model Y crossover, the Model 3 sedan and any future cars, according to company filings. The factory hall will include a pressing plant, paint shop and seat manufacturing in a building that will be 744 meters (2,440 feet) long—nearly triple the length of the Titanic. There’s space for four such facilities.
Musk is taking his fight for the future of transport into the heartland of the combustion engine, where the established players long laughed off Tesla as an upstart on feeble financial footing that couldn’t compete with their rich engineering heritage. He casually dropped the news at an awards ceremony in Berlin in November, leaving the top brass of Germany’s car industry shell-shocked.
“Elon Musk is going where his strongest competitors are, right into the heart of the global auto industry,” said Juergen Pieper, a Frankfurt-based analyst with Bankhaus Metzler. “No other foreign carmaker has done that in decades given Germany’s high wages, powerful unions and high taxes.”
Building a factory in Europe’s largest car market is a major test of Musk’s global ambitions. Demand in the region is flat, and buyers are more loyal to local brands. Meanwhile, labor costs in Germany’s auto sector are 50% higher than in the U.S. and five times what they are in Poland, just an hour’s drive away from Gruenheide.
Gruenheide Timeline
 End February: Finish tree logging before migrant birds nest March 5: Deadline for comments from nearby residents March 18: Public meeting to discuss the project Mid-2020: Construction expected to begin July 2021: Targeted start of productionOn the positive side, electric cars require less labor to build, and Germany has a deep reserve of auto experts. The location also offers the soft-power advantage of proximity to the country’s leaders.
Under pressure for being slow to pick up on the electric-car shift, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government extended a welcoming hand to Musk. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier offered to try to ease regulatory hurdles that may snag construction. “There’s a lot at stake” in Tesla’s plan, he said soon after the project was announced.
Musk’s incursion comes at a strategically opportune time. Riding a wave of optimism after successfully starting deliveries of its China-built Model 3 sedans a year after breaking ground on a factory there, Tesla’s stock has doubled in the past three months.
Meanwhile, German peers are struggling with the costly shift away from combustion engines. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler announced thousands of job cuts last year, when German car production fell to its lowest level in almost a quarter of a century.
 For Gruenheide, the planned investment has suddenly transformed the town of 8,700 people into a sought-after location. Local officials receive development proposals on a daily basis: anything from 22-story apartment towers to U.S.-style shopping malls, said Christiani, who hopes the plant will help unlock financing for public transport, schools and medical facilities.
In the town hall, five thick binders are available for locals to peruse the project’s details, including 463 trucks expected to roll into the plant each day, a rail spur for train deliveries and an on-site fire brigade.
Tesla still has to jump through a number of hoops. Residents have the chance to raise objections, and then the company has to carry out initiatives to protect wildlife—including scaring off any wolves in the area, relocating hibernating bats and removing lizards and snakes until construction is finished. The U.S. carmaker also has to replace felled trees.
The mayor expects these hurdles to be cleared so that the first made-in-Gruenheide Teslas can roll out in July 2021.
“The forest is classified as a harvest-ready, inferior pine forest,” Christiani said. “It was never supposed to be a rain forest.”"

Investing.com - Here is a summary from the most important regulatory news releases from the London Stock Exchange ahead of the UK market open on Friday 17 January. Please refresh for updates for UK market news from the LSE’s RNS on individual UK shares from FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and FTSE All-Share.

Mining company   Rio Tinto   (LON:RIO) cited poor weather conditions and operational challenges as reasons for a drop in iron ore shipments in 2019. It said production of aluminum and copper was also down. 


Copper production was 5% lower than in 2018, while aluminium production was down 2%. Iron ore production was down around 3% at 326.7 million tonnes. 


The company said its guidance for 2020 was dependent on global GDP growth and would be tempered by geopolitical tensions and oil price volatility. 


“We have the platform and performance to maintain our delivery of superior returns to shareholders over the short, medium and long-term, driven by our strong value over volume approach and ongoing disciplined allocation of capital.” said CEO J-S Jacques. 


Mr Kipling owner    Premier Foods    (LON:PFD) said sales grew 2.6% in the third quarter, with grocery sales up 0.3%. A strong domestic performance in the U.K. helped offset a 17% drop in revenue from its international business. 


U.K. overall revenue was up 3.6%, with the Mr Kipling brand up 10%. It said profit expectations for the year remain unchanged.


GVC (LON:GVC), the owner of   Ladbrokes   (LON:LCL) and Coral, said annual core earnings would be at the top end of expectations, due mostly to gains in online betting.

The company, which also owns the bwin brand, said total annual group net gaming revenue was up 2%, although sales at its U.K. betting shops fell 11% in the last quarter of the year in like-for-like terms, as Britain cut the maximum stake allowed on high-speed slot machines to 2 pounds ($2.62) from 100 pounds, reflecting the clampdown on fixed-odds betting terminals.

Credit-checking group Experian (LON:EXPN) posted an overall rise in revenue in the third quarter, however it saw declines in the U.K. and Irish markets.
Experian said overall growth was up 7% in the three months to the end of December, with North America up 11%.
Growth in its U.K. business was down 3%, largely as a result of a 12% drop in its U.K. business-to-business division.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) is set to take a 20% stake in Chinese electric vehicle battery maker Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd, two sources told Reuters, as the German firm accelerates its electric push into the world's largest auto market.
The deal would mark Volkswagen's first direct ownership in a Chinese battery maker and comes as the Wolfsburg-based automaker strives to meet a goal of selling 1.5 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) a year in China by 2025, including plug-in hybrid cars.
The top foreign automaker in China plans to acquire the stake in Shenzhen-listed Guoxuan via a discounted private share placement in the coming weeks, the two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Based on Guoxuan's market capitalization of $2.8 billion, a 20% stake in the company at present is worth about $560 million. 
The deal's details have been mostly finalized and the two firms are waiting for new Chinese regulatory rules on private share placements that will provide a more flexible pricing mechanism and shorter lock-up periods for majority shareholders, said one of the people, speaking on condition of anonymity.
After the stake purchase, Volkswagen will become the battery maker's second-largest shareholder with a 20% stake, behind Zhuhai Guoxuan Trading Ltd, a firm controlled by Guoxuan's founder Li Zhen, which currently holds 25%. 
Shares in Guoxuan surged by their maximum 10% on the news on Friday to trade at their highest level since March last year. 
Volkswagen declined to comment. Guoxuan and the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.
An executive at Guoxuan's board secretary's office told the government-backed Securities Times newspaper it had not yet received news about a stake acquisition.

Guoxuan is among a swathe of mid-tier Chinese battery makers behind CATL and BYD. It is based in China's eastern city of Hefei, where Volkswagen is also building electric vehicles with JAC Motor, one of a number of its Chinese joint venture partners.
A third source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Volkswagen has long wanted to control a battery maker to better manage its supply chain.
To achieve its NEV sales goal in China, Volkswagen has built a new $2.5 billion electric vehicle plant with partner SAIC Motor that will have annual output capacity of 300,000 cars and is also revamping manufacturing facilities in China's southeastern city of Foshan to build electric cars with partner FAW Group.
Volkswagen has also identified CATL as a strategic supplier and Volkswagen board member Stefan Sommer told Reuters in July last year that it could even build its own battery cell manufacturing plants in China.
""By holding a stake in the top Chinese battery makers, carmakers can gain more bargaining power on battery prices,"" said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight. ""Foreign carmakers are now catching up with their Chinese counterparts on securing battery supplies in China."" 
Volkswagen's rivals in China include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which earlier this month began delivering cars from its $2 billion factory in China. The U.S. electric car maker eventually plans to manufacture 250,000 vehicles a year in the plant's first phase. 
China has been a keen supporter of NEV - pure battery electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrids - and has started implementing NEV sales quota requirements for automakers.

However, cuts to subsidies have dealt the market a blow, with NEV sales contracting for the first time last year. Sales this year are likely to be flat or rise only slightly, according to China's top auto industry association.

228,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 02:53AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Temasek, Trustbridge target majority stake in WeWork China at $1 billion valuation – sources","By Yingzhi Yang and Julie Zhu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Temasek Holdings and Trustbridge Partners have held talks with WeWork China over increasing their stake in the China branch of the troubled co-working startup to take majority ownership, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The plan values WeWork China at around $1 billion, two of the people said.
The proposal was submitted to WeWork's major stakeholder, Japanese technology conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp, at the end of last year, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. 
Singapore state investor Temasek and Shanghai-based private equity firm Trustbridge want to buy more shares to give them a combined majority stake in WeWork China, according to the people.
WeWork currently owns 59% of WeWork China, with the remainder held by other investors including SoftBank, Hony Capital and Trustbridge, according to the group's prospectus for its initial public offering.
The Chinese unit had raised $500 million in July 2018 from investors including Temasek, Trustbridge, SoftBank and Chinese fund Hony Capital in a deal valuing the firm at about $5 billion. That was the second round, with the firm having previously raised $500 million in 2017.
A new deal giving Temasek and Trustbridge a majority stake would likely mean that WeWork China would go through a down round - a fall in valuation following a new investment if the proposal got passed - but could significantly ease the financial burden on WeWork and SoftBank. 
They added that the discussions were at an early stage and a deal was not certain. 
SoftBank, Temasek and WeWork declined to comment. Trustbridge did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The larger WeWork group is undergoing a broad restructuring after it was thrown a $9.5 billion lifeline by SoftBank following a failed public offering and the ouster of founder Adam Neumann. 
However, SoftBank's plan to secure $3 billion from Japan's three biggest banks have stalled, likely complicating its rescue package for WeWork, Reuters has reported. 
WeWork China has set out ambitious revenue goals for 2020, Reuters reported last month, even though it faces staff cutbacks and weak occupancy numbers at its properties across China.
In 2018, WeWork China generated $99.5 million in revenue, according to WeWork's IPO prospectus. 
WeWork's woes have had a ripple effect across the sector, impacting the likes of UCommune, WeWork China's rival, which is trying to launch an initial public offering. 
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG walked away from underwriting UCommune's IPO because they decided they could not deliver the offering at a previously discussed valuation.

UCommune has now tapped little-known U.S. investment bank Benchmark Company LLC to launch its listing, Reuters reported earlier this month.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to edge higher at the open Friday, helped by hefty gains on Wall Street overnight, although data from China indicating slowing growth may weigh on sentiment.
At 02:15 ET (0715 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 20 points, or 0.2% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 6 points, or 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. was unchanged. Futures on the eurozone Euro Stoxx 50 benchmark, rose 2 points, or 0.1%.
Wall Street closed in buoyant mood Thursday amid signs that the domestic consumption remains on solid footing. An in-line retail sales release eased any budding concerns about the economic health of the U.S. shopper after a disappointing sales report from retail giant   Target   (NYSE:TGT).
TheS&P 500 rose 0.8%, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 0.9%. All three major averages ended the day in record territory.
That said, stock market gains are likely to be tepid in Europe Friday following the release of growth data out of China, The country reported that its gross domestic product grew 6% in the fourth quarter, meaning economic growth slowed to 6.1% in 2019. While this is in line with expectations, it’s also the country’s weakest growth in nearly three decades.
This matters because Chinese demand, mostly for industrial and manufactured goods, has been a boon for European manufacturers for a number of years. The EU is China's largest trading partner, and China is the EU's second-largest trade partner after the U.S. 
“Looking forward, the trade deal with the U.S. is expected to take away some of the uncertainty in China,” according to Nordea analyst Tuuli Koivu, in a research note. “However, we may not see a dramatic rise in growth numbers due to the fact that as growth prospects improve, the authorities feel less need to support growth via monetary or fiscal policy.”
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is also set to be in the spotlight Friday following a Reuters report that it is set to take a 20% stake in Chinese electric vehicle battery maker Guoxuan High-Tech Co Ltd (SZ:002074)
The deal would mark Volkswagen's first direct ownership in a Chinese battery maker. VW is striving to meet a goal of selling 1.5 million new energy vehicles a year in China by 2025, including plug-in hybrid cars.
On the economic date release slate in Europe later Friday is the U.K. retail sales number for December, at 4:30 AM ET (0930 GMT). EU inflation data are due at 5:00 AM ET (1000 GMT).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - European Union trade commissioner Phil Hogan said his meetings with senior U.S. officials marked a ""good start"" to resetting trade ties with Washington, but there was more work to do.
Hogan said on Thursday that he had a good exchange of views with U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer twice during his visit, underscoring Brussels' desire to negotiate solutions for several open disputes between the allies and avoid costly and economically damaging tit-for-tat tariffs.
""It's a good start ... but we've a lot more to do,"" Hogan told reporters after over three days of meetings with U.S. officials, lawmakers and business executives, with further trips planned in February and March.
He said Brussels hoped to leverage concerns it shares with Washington, about China and the need to reform the World Trade Organization, to move forward on settling disputes about aircraft subsidies, digital service taxes and trade barriers.
""I didn't expect to be successful in resetting the relationship in two days,"" Hogan said.
The USTR had no immediate comment on the meetings with Hogan beyond a statement on Tuesday together with the EU and Japan that unveiled a joint proposal to call for global rules on use of market-distorting government subsidies by China and other countries.
Former EU agriculture commissioner Hogan said he had worked with Lighthizer in the past to successfully resolve a dispute over hormone-free beef.
""Sometimes we like the messages and sometimes we don’t, but at least we know where we stand, and that’s nice to have as well,"" Hogan said of his dealings with Lighthizer.
The EU was open to considering a mini-trade deal similar to those negotiated by Washington with Japan and other countries, Hogan said. One prospect might be to focus on sanitary and phytosanitary standards, he said.
Brussels was not ready to put agriculture on the table in broader trade talks, Hogan said, but the EU had already increased purchases of U.S. soybeans, cereal and liquified natural gas as a goodwill gesture.
He said there was also greater U.S. engagement with an EU proposal to resolve a dispute over government subsidies to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus. U.S. officials viewed the proposal as insufficient, but it offered a basis for discussions, Hogan said.
China and its aircraft industry will be the biggest winners if the United States and the EU do not resolve their differences and work together, Hogan said at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event.
He said tit-for-tat tariffs would harm both sides, but the EU would respond if Washington slapped tariffs on EU products in the aircraft subsidy case."

Investing.com - Asian markets advanced in morning trade on Friday. All eyes will be on the release of the country’s GDP data for the fourth quarter. 
China’s Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component traded 0.4% and 0.1% higher respectively by 8:35 PM ET (02:35 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.1%.
A Reuters poll forecast China’s GDP in the fourth quarter grew 6% from a year earlier. That would be unchanged from the pace in the third quarter, which was believed to be its slowest GDP gain in at least 27 ½ years.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.5%. South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.1%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.6%.
Overnight, U.S. stocks closed higher as the signing of the phase one trade deal between the U.S. and China continued to provide support to the markets. 
“This is a very important and remarkable occasion,” U.S. President Donald Trump said during the signing ceremony at the White House on Wednesday. Fixing what he sees as the injustices of past trade deals is “probably the biggest reason why I ran for president,” he added. “Together we are righting the wrongs of the past.”
Under the terms of the deal, the U.S. slashes tariffs on $120 billion in Chinese goods to 7.5% from 15%. In exchange, China agreed to increase purchases in the U.S. by $200 billion over the next two years in manufactured goods, agriculture, energy and services.
However, gains were limited as some analysts called the deal “fragile” as it includes an option for China to exit the trade deal should the U.S. re-impose tariffs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.92% higher to hit a new all time high, while the S&P 500 index added 0.84%, and the NASDAQ Composite index added 1.06%."

(Reuters) - Gap Inc (N:GPS) on Thursday scrapped its plan to spin-off Old Navy and said it would instead work to stem dropping sales, while fewer discounts during the holiday season helped full-year earnings, sending its shares up about 4%. 
The move came as a surprise as just two months ago the company had stuck to its plan to separate despite several analysts calling for the strategy to be canned due to weak sales and the abrupt exit of Chief Executive Officer Art Peck.
Peck unveiled the plan in February last year when Old Navy was a bright spot for the company, which was struggling with out-of-fashion apparel at its Gap brand.
However, sales for Old Navy have slowed in recent quarters, raising doubts about the brand's value as a separate entity. 
""Old Navy's business has not been good. With the CEO out of the way, this is the right move,"" said Jane Hali, at research firm Jane Hali & Associates.
""Instead of thinking of spinning off companies, they should get back to the basics of giving customers what they're asking for."" 
The company on Thursday also said that Mark Breitbard, head of Banana Republic, will lead the Gap brand on interim basis after the departure of Chief Executive Officer Neil Fiske. 
""The work we've done to prepare for the spin shone a bright light on operational inefficiencies and areas for improvement,"" Gap interim CEO Robert Fisher said.
The company is searching for a permanent CEO, whose primary task, according to Craig Johnson, president at retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners, will be to fix the big three brands - Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic.
""Launching an independent Navy when none of the big brands is ready for prime time would be a bridge too far,"" he said. 
Gap said same-store sales for 2019 would be at the higher end of its prior outlook, but would still drop from a year earlier as brick and mortar retailers lose holiday shoppers to online competition.
It forecast adjusted 2019 earnings to be moderately above its prior outlook of $1.70 to $1.75 per share.
Gap shares were up at $19.44 in extended trading.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) aims to announce roughly one $1 billion to $5 billion deal every quarter in 2020, its chief financial officer told Reuters, as the U.S. drugmaker looks to build up its pipeline of future products.
It will focus largely on earlier stage opportunities across key therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, immunology, and neurology, CFO John Smiley told Reuters in an interview at the JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco earlier this week.
Eli Lilly has been on a deal-making spree in recent years in a bid to increase products and sales in core franchises as older blockbuster medicines, such as diabetes treatment Humalog, face generic competition and pressure to lower prices.
Last week, it announced a $1.1 billion deal to buy dermatology products maker  Dermira  Inc (O:DERM). With the purchase, Lilly will acquire Dermira's experimental treatment for atopic dermatitis, a serious form of eczema, which is in late-stage testing, as well as an approved medicated cloth to treat excessive armpit sweating.
""We are looking at Dermira-like opportunities targeting assets in the $1 billion to $5 billion range,"" Smiley said. ""We'd like to be doing something in the range of one per quarter or so.""
In 2018 and 2019, it announced several deals for cancer companies, including an $8 billion acquisition of Loxo Oncology. U.S. regulators in 2018 approved Vitrakvi, Loxo's first commercial medicine, which treats a wide variety of cancers triggered by a rare genetic mutation.
In a presentation to investors this week, Lilly Chief Executive David Ricks said most of its deals will be in the cancer space, but that other therapeutic areas remain of strong interest as well.
While the company is still looking at late-stage assets, Smiley said the most opportunity for shareholders is in drugs in earlier stages of development.
Deals could include licensing agreements, outright acquisitions, or other structures, he added.
In its most recent earnings call, Lilly forecast a higher-than-expected profit for 2020, citing growing demand for its newer medicines including diabetes drug Trulicity and Taltz for psoriasis and other related autoimmune diseases.
However, sales of Trulicity and other newer medicines have been crimped by high rebates and discounts drugmakers pay to middlemen, such as pharmacy benefit managers, in order to make sure patients have access to their products."

The Minneapolis-based but Australia-listed company, offers U.S. and Canadian consumers small, interest-free installment loans. In return, it takes over the sales contract between the consumer and merchant for payment processing.
The California Department of Business Oversight, which regulates financial service providers in the state, had determined that Sezzle was already engaged in lending without a license since it was purchasing these payment contracts, thereby violating its financing laws.
Sezzle on Friday said the approval would now allow the company to shift to a direct structure that would remove merchants from the financing process. 
""This is a great result for Sezzle and provides the platform for us to continue our planned growth strategy in the state of California,” Sezzle Chief Executive Charlie Youakim said in a statement. 
Companies like Sezzle have gained popularity with young shoppers by providing them with easy credit to spend online.
The buy-now-pay-later sector has come under scrutiny, with regulators questioning the business model and whether such credit should be treated as a bank loan.

Investing.com - The retail rally continued in after-hours trading Thursday as investors bid up shares of Gap.
Gap (NYSE:GPS) gained 6% postmarket after the company released upbeat guidance and said it no longer plans to spin off Old Navy into a separate company.
The company said it expects full-year 2019 same-store sales and net sales to be at the higher end of guidance.
Earnings will be “moderately above” previous guidance of $1.70 to $1.75 per share, thanks to “better than anticipated promotional levels over the holiday period, particularly at Old Navy,” the company said.
The National Retail Federation reported earlier today that holiday sales rose 4.1% in 2019 from the year-ago period.
""The plan to separate (Old Navy) was rooted in our commitment to value creation from our portfolio of iconic brands,"" Robert Fisher, Gap interim president and CEO, said in a statement. ""While the objectives of the separation remain relevant, our board of directors has concluded that the cost and complexity of splitting into two companies, combined with softer business performance, limited our ability to create appropriate value from separation.”
The company will appoint a new CEO to oversee all its brands."

Exports of at least 1 million barrels of oil were put on hold after the government announced this week that certain maritime fees, currently paid in euros, must be paid in Petros starting Monday, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Buyers worry the payment may be in violation of sanctions after the U.S. targeted the cryptocurrency, calling it a “scam.”
The oil-rich nation launched the Petro two years ago as a way to navigate wide-reaching U.S. sanctions that have cut off Venezuela from international capital markets. Although banners with the Petro symbol adorn government buildings in downtown Caracas, it’s largely ignored by Venezuelans who don’t know how or where to buy it. It’s backed by the country’s oil reserves, the world’s largest.
The move to require payments in Petros is an attempt to boost the crypto and help Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s reduce his country’s dependence on foreign currencies. It comes as crude exports are starting to recover from U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and its oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Oil exports rebounded in December, surpassing the 1 million-barrel-a-day mark for the first time since February.
Crude buyers typically use shipping agencies based in Venezuela to pay port fees. Although buyers are not directly involved, at least one company last year included a clause prohibiting shipping agents from using money transfers to buy digital currencies in Venezuela after the Petro was sanctioned in March 2018, according to a document seen by Bloomberg.
Most companies taking Venezuelan crude no longer pay cash. Instead, they engage in swap transactions, where they take crude oil in exchange for gasoline or diesel. Others, like Eni SpA and Repsol (MC:REP) SA, get oil in payment for old debts."

Leaders in Wichita, Kansas, suffered a series of gut punches in recent weeks after their biggest employer, Spirit AeroSystems, said it would stop working on the troubled Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Max jetliner and later announced 2,800 layoffs in its home city.
City manager Robert Layton is sitting through two or three meetings a week on what to expect, as fallout from the Max’s temporary shut-down ripples through the aircraft’s 600 mostly U.S. suppliers. Republican Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas promptly called Boeing’s new chief executive and the head of the Federal Aviation Administration to urge them to get the Max flying again. The new mayor of Wichita -- a city of 380,000 that claims to be the “Air Capital of the World” -- just took office on Monday, three days after Spirit announced its mass layoffs.
Boeing is the largest manufacturer and exporter in the U.S. Its stumble, which started with the fatal crashes of two 737 Max aircraft and culminated in the grounding of its best-selling Max fleet last March, could have repercussions for the entire U.S. economy.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the company’s problems could cut U.S. gross domestic product by half a percentage point this year -- a figure repeated by President Donald Trump on Wednesday.
While Wichita tries to suss out what’s to come, aviation supply chain experts warn that the numerous suppliers could fail causing major job losses if the U.S. industrial titan allows the Max program’s shutdown to linger much past this month. Boeing shares have fallen about 25% from a record high on March 1.
“I would not be surprised that smaller suppliers end up going out of business, because they’re two, three levels down,” said Gary Weissel at consultancy Tronos Aviation Consulting. “The guys above them can’t take deliveries.”
That could prove a hurdle for Trump as he makes his case for reelection on the strength of the economy and his record on job creation, although Boeing’s biggest supplier bases in Kansas and Washington are in deeply red and blue states, respectively.
“With the shutdown, there could be political pressure exerted in the FAA’s direction to get things moving,” said Kevin Michaels, a managing director at consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory.
So far, there’s been relatively little bloodletting at Boeing’s suppliers throughout the Max’s 10-month grounding. Several Max suppliers didn’t return calls to discuss the potential impact on their businesses, while the Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance, a collection of aviation companies, declined to comment.
”We are working with local and state organizations to help provide information about available opportunities and resources to employees who need them,” a Spirit spokeswoman said.
‘Delicate Balancing Act’
Still, there have been relatively few job cuts to date because, until now, Boeing had kept producing 42 Max planes a month, down only slightly from its previous rate of 52 a month. That probably will change now that Boeing suspended production of the model this month, analysts said.
Moody’s Investors Service in a Jan. 10 report identified 24 Max suppliers whose credit it had previously rated. Big suppliers like Precision Castparts Corp. and Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON). are best suited to withstand the shutdown, while smaller companies could face the most financial stress, according to Moody’s.
“Each supplier will face a delicate balancing act involving efforts to quickly reduce overhead costs,” while making sure it’s able to ramp up again when Boeing restarts production, Moody’s wrote.
Boeing is talking with suppliers about ways that it can mitigate their challenges through “delivery rate options,” a company spokesman said, without giving further details.
In Wichita, community leaders are trying to diversify their economy so it’s not so dependent on aviation. Aerospace hit its peak in Wichita in 2008 at more than 40,000 jobs, but by 2017 employment had fallen by a third to about 26,000.
The 2,800 layoffs at Spirit, which makes aircraft fuselages and other major components, is expected to cut into the area’s wages by around $220 million, although unemployment insurance would offset some of that, said Jeremy Hill, director of the Center for Economic Development and Business Research at Wichita State University.
The loss of such valuable jobs would deal a blow to the Wichita economy. Average aerospace positions in the community pays $80,000 a year, or almost double the average for all industries.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 rallied through the 3,300 mark for the first time on Thursday and the other main U.S. indexes also surged to record highs, fueled by tech stocks, solid retail sales data and upbeat quarterly earnings from  Morgan Stanley . 
Morgan Stanley (N:MS) jumped 6.6% to lead the S&P 500 after it beat quarterly profit estimates and raised its performance goals, closing out several big U.S. lenders' earnings on a strong note.
Sentiment was further lifted by data that showed U.S. retail sales rose 0.3% in December, in line with economists' estimates.
The retail numbers indicated the U.S. economy maintained a moderate growth pace at the end of 2019 and eased concerns about the sector's health following disappointing holiday sales reports from  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP).
""The consumer needs to be strong and evidence of that is retail sales, which came in pretty well after some slowing over the last several months,"" said Tom Martin, portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta.
Technology stocks, which have played an outsized part in the recent rally, made fresh gains. The S&P information technology index (SPLRCT) added 1.4% to a record high, leading gains among the main sectors.  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) rose 1.8% and chipmakers also surged after a strong forecast from top contract chip manufacturer TSMC (TW:2330) (N:TSM). 
The new highs on Wall Street come after Washington and Beijing on Wednesday signed a deal pausing an 18-month long tariff war that had bruised financial markets and crimped global growth.
China is expected to boost purchases of U.S. goods and services in exchange for the rolling back of some tariffs as part of the deal, but several thorny issues remain unresolved.
Analysts expect profits at S&P 500 companies to have dropped 0.4% in the fourth quarter, but full-year 2020 earnings are estimated to grow 9.6%, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Full-year earnings estimates typically decline as the year advances.
The Russell 2000 index (RUT) of small-cap stocks jumped 1.36%, its strongest session so far in 2020. 
""Small caps this week are starting to act better and gain interest from investors,"" said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird. ""Broad participation in the market is giving people a sense of ease right now that it's not just a handful of companies moving higher.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) jumped 0.92% to end at 29,297.64 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.84% to 3,316.89.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 1.06% to 9,357.13, bringing its gain in 2020 to 4.29%.
Among other stocks, Signet Jewelers Ltd (N:SIG) soared 40% after raising its 2020 adjusted earnings estimate. 
Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK) tumbled 7.8% to the bottom of the S&P 500 after the custodian bank missed profit estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.57-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.78-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 100 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 200 new highs and seven new lows.

Investing.com - CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) reported mixed fourth-quarter results as earnings beat, but revenue fell short of forecasts as efforts to cut costs boosted its bottom line.

The firm reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.99 on revenue of $2.89 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $0.98 on revenue of $2.94 billion. That compared to EPS of $1.01 on revenue of $3.14 billion in the same period a year earlier. The company had reported EPS of $1.08 on revenue of $2.98 billion in the previous quarter.
The fall in revenue for the fourth quarter was blamed on lower volumes and negative mix from coal market headwinds. But the impact from lower revenue was kept in a check by ongoing efforts to trim expenses, which fell 9% year over year to $1.73 billion.

“The railroad has never run better and we are delivering great service to our customers,” said James M. Foote, president and chief executive officer. “What is really amazing is how our employees stepped up to produce efficiencies during tough economic conditions.”

Investing.com – The S&P closed at a record high Thursday as signs the consumer remains on solid footing and bullish earnings from   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) prompted a wave of buying across stocks.
The S&P 500 rose 0.84%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.06% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 0.92%. All three major averages ended the day in record terriroty.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) rallied 6.6% as the Wall Street bank raised its profit outlook following results that beat on both the top and bottom lines. The earnings beat following a similar showing from rivals like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) earlier this week.
The day of green was also supported by easing worries over the health of U.S. consumer, which has been one of the main catalysts underpinning economic growth, following in-line retail sales.
A weaker-than-expected sales report from   Target   (NYSE:TGT) a day earlier had raised doubts on the strength of the U.S. consumer over the crucial holiday period.
Still, some on Wall Street said the weaker report from Target may signal headwinds for Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which reports earnings next month.
""We don’t think WMT was immune to the headwinds TGT faced in the weaker product categories it called out, and it may also have been affected by the shorter holiday period,"" Morgan Stanley said.
Tech, meanwhile, remained red-hot thanks to gains in tech heavyweights like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Alphabet's advance into the close took its marketcap above $1 trillion for the first time, joining other tech stalwarts who have achieved the milestone such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)."

(Reuters) - Bank of America Private Bank (N:BAC), formerly U.S. Trust, is doubling down on efforts to court more business from the country's wealthiest individuals, an executive told Reuters.
By the end of this year, Bank of America Corp's private banking arm aims to double its adviser force from 2014 levels to 600 and expand to 40 markets from 20 in 2017.
""We've made a massive investment in the business from a technology standpoint, people and real estate,"" said Katy Knox, president of Bank of America Private Bank. ""Now, it's really making sure that our folks can hit the ground running.""
Last year those investments started showing results. The wealth division, which caters to individuals with at least $3 million to invest, added 64% more households in 2019, helping the unit end the year with a record of $288 billion in assets under management.
Bank of America bought U.S. Trust, a storied firm that once handled money for families like the Astors, in 2007 in a deal that vaulted the bank to top of the U.S. private banking rankings with $270 billion assets under management. But asset growth has lagged competitors since then. JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) private banking arm now boasts more than $670 billion assets under management and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) has roughly $460 billion globally.
Early in 2019, the bank dropped the 166-year-old U.S. Trust name in favor of its own, and moved to accelerate growth by streamlining management structures and integrating the private bank more deeply with Bank of America's other business lines.
The business launched new initiatives in partnership with the investment and corporate banks to increase the amount of chief executives using the private bank to manage their personal wealth. That's helped grow referrals between the private bank and other businesses by 30% to 7,000 in 2019.
In addition to tapping its corporate parent's existing client list, the private bank is taking share by re-entering markets it left behind after the financial crisis and pushing into new markets like Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and Salt Lake City, Knox said.
The business is also looking to strengthen its presence in growth markets like Northern and Southern (NYSE:SO) California.
Bank of America has been deepening its bench of private advisers by training and promoting back-office staff internally, which has improved retention and productivity levels, Knox said.
Last year, new relationships per adviser jumped 35% compared with 2018.
The business is also poaching talent from rivals in new markets. When the bank moved into Cincinnati last year, it hired private client advisers away from regional and national competitors like PNC Financial Services Group Inc (N:PNC) and JPMorgan, according to LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
Overall, adviser count was up 8% to 482 in 2019.""That is a big sales force out there taking share,"" Knox said."

PARIS (Reuters) - The French government plans to introduce a ""price corridor"" for France's wholesale nuclear power market that will enable state-controlled utility EDF (PA:EDF) to cover its costs while shielding consumers from volatile electricity price spikes.
Set out in a consultative paper, the new model would replace the ARENH nuclear market scheme under which EDF, which operates France's 58 nuclear reactors, is obliged to sell 100 terawatt hour or around a quarter of its annual nuclear output to rivals at a fixed price of 42 euros ($46.84) a megawatt hour (MWh).
It would boost the bottom-line of the heavily indebted utility, while continuing to provide French consumers with one of the cheapest retail electricity rates in Europe, according to the document.
Power from the reactors covers around 75% of French energy needs.
EDF says the ARENH price is too low and is advantageous to its competitors, allowing them to buy cheap nuclear when wholesale market prices rise above 42 euros/MWh but buy elsewhere when market prices are low.
The government-proposed reform would see the introduction of a price corridor, with a floor and ceiling price for nuclear power generated by French reactors, including the under-construction Flamanville 3 EPR reactor.
""The floor and ceiling price levels would be fixed using a transparent methodology and would be implemented under the control of the energy market regulator CRE,"" the government said in a consultative document presented to journalists.
The floor and ceiling price levels would allow for a fair remuneration for EDF that would cover its complete costs, and for a reasonable remuneration of its assets with regard to the risks it carries, the document said.
The floor and ceiling prices are still to be determined, but the difference would be around 6 euros/MWh.
French officials say the reform will not impact European wholesale power prices, and that it will introduce more liquidity to the market, with most French nuclear power available to European consumers thanks to the coupling of the European power market. This allows suppliers to purchase power anywhere in the 28-nation bloc.
""All European consumers will have access to the (nuclear) volumes in the wholesale market, this will contribute to price formation,"" it said.
The French government will need the go-ahead from the European Union's competition authorities to proceed. The ARENH scheme is due to end in December 2025. ($1 = 0.8966 euros)"
252,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 02:38PM ET</span>","In the U.S.-China Deal, Trump Finds a Way Around WTO Process","(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
The first phase of President Donald Trump’s accord with China aims to resolve a series of longstanding trade disputes between Washington and Beijing and in doing so, may bolster his theory that unilateral tariffs are a better enforcement tool than the World Trade Organization.
As part of Wednesday’s deal, China pledged to address various policies that the U.S. has pursued in past WTO disputes, such as Beijing’s technology transfer requirements; subsidies and quotas for agricultural goods; and restrictions on foreign financial services providers.
The agreement reinforces U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer’s view that the best way to get China to quickly and comprehensively comply with WTO disputes is to negotiate them under threat of punitive tariffs.
“Relying solely on the WTO litigation has its flaws,” Lighthizer told members of the Senate Finance Committee last year. “You can be winning cases for years and years and years and not getting real outcomes.”
Lighthizer has long been a critic of the WTO’s cumbersome dispute settlement process, which helps resolve trade conflicts among its 164 members. He previously said that nations are exploiting the WTO to try to “gain concessions through lawsuits that they could never get at the negotiating table.”
Technology Transfers
The U.S.-China pact requires both governments to eschew any policies that require or pressure companies or people to transfer their technologies as a condition of doing business.
“Any transfer or licensing of technology between persons of a party and those of the other party must be based on market terms that are voluntary and reflect mutual agreement,” the accord said.
The U.S. and China also said they would protect the confidentiality of any “sensitive technical information” disclosed during regulatory or administrative reviews and the parties would not require or pressure foreign entities to disclose sensitive technical information that’s not necessary to conduct such reviews.
The commitments could help resolve a 2018 WTO complaint against a half-dozen Chinese laws that the U.S. said violated WTO rules governing the use of trade-related intellectual property rights.
The case cuts to the heart of the conflict because Trump argued that his retaliatory tariffs were necessary to counter an alleged Chinese campaign to steal American IP.
Electronic Payments
Another important commitment in phase one requires Chinese regulators to rapidly process applications from U.S. electronic payment providers -- such as  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP)., Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA)., and  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V). -- to operate as wholly foreign-owned entities in China.
In return, the U.S. said it would offer non-discriminatory treatment to Chinese electronic-payment service suppliers, including China UnionPay.
The new commitments could help address U.S. allegations that China failed to comply with a 2012 WTO ruling that rejected Beijing’s discriminatory treatment of U.S. credit-card companies.
The U.S. has long argued that the Chinese policies regarding uniform business specifications, technical standards and operability rules effectively prevented foreign access to China’s $1 trillion annual e-payment services marketplace.
Chinese Agricultural Rules
Phase one of the agreement also requires China to fully comply with WTO’s findings in a pair of U.S. dispute victories against China’s agricultural subsidies and quotas.
The agreement said China must adhere to its WTO agriculture commitments and ensure that, from Dec. 31, 2019, its tariff-rate quota measures for wheat, rice, and corn are in conformity with the terms of a 2019 WTO ruling.
Last year, the WTO found that Beijing provided farm subsidies in excess of its international trade commitments and didn’t follow proper procedures when it imposed trade restrictions on agricultural imports.
China has already agreed to comply with the rulings, rather than seek to appeal the WTO’s findings in the hopes of obtaining a more favorable ruling.
“China has not been transparent about its protectionist policies,” said Vince Peterson, president of U.S. Wheat Associates. “Now it remains to be seen if China will comply fully with its WTO commitments and this new agreement so that trade between our two countries can flourish.”
Dispute Settlement
Phase one will further sideline the WTO’s dispute settlement system because it establishes a bilateral dispute resolution arrangement whereby the U.S. and China will regularly meet to resolve any issues with the agreement.
QuickTake: What’s Next for Trade Referee After Sabotage by U.S.
This comes a month after the Trump administration essentially paralyzed the WTO’s dispute settlement system by choking off staff and funding for the appellate body.
As of Dec. 11, the WTO’s seven-member appellate body, which acts as a quasi-supreme court for disputes that involve billions of dollars in international commerce, is now unable to issue any judgments on future trade dispute cases.
While WTO members can still bring disputes to the trade body and receive an initial ruling, any party to the dispute could appeal that ruling into legal limbo -- thereby providing the losing party with a veto.
That means the WTO has lost its ability to fully adjudicate trade disputes and governments are now free to impose unilateral measures on their trade partners without fear of WTO oversight."

CHICAGO/ NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump gained support among American farm families at the end of last year, Reuters/Ipsos poll data showed, as Trump touted a Phase 1 trade deal with key agricultural buyer China.
The results show American farmers increasingly backed the Republican president as he sought to pause a drawn out trade war with Beijing that cut deeply into U.S. agricultural sales. The trade deal, announced Dec. 13 and signed on Wednesday, paves the way for increased farm exports to China, though critics have said it failed to address structural economic differences.
The nation's some 3 million farmers broadly voted for Trump in 2016 but have suffered more than other sectors from the tit-for-tat tariff war with China that started in 2018.
Among those polled in late December who said they or an immediate family member work in the agriculture industry, 49% approved of the way Trump is handling American farming and 40% disapproved. In September, 43% approved and 45% disapproved.
Of the poll's total 4,441 respondents, 39% said they approved of the way the president is handling American farming, up from 36% in September, while 41% disapproved, down from 44%.
""Everybody's hoping it's going to get all in place andthere's going to be a boom,"" Esin Zimmerman, 53, a surveyparticipant and Republican from Madison, Minnesota, said about the trade deal. Zimmerman, whose husband works for agricultural trader Cargill Inc, voted for Trump in 2016 and wants to see him re-elected.
Trump's critics say the trade war has not been worth the lost sales of soybeans, pork and other goods in 2018 and 2019 and call the deal's target of nearly doubling the value of U.S. farm exports to China from 2017 levels unrealistic.
Trump faced anger from farmers last year because his administration's Environmental Protection Agency has roughly quadrupled exemptions for oil refiners that are required to blend corn-based ethanol into gasoline. Corn growers and biofuel producers say this has significantly undercut demand for ethanol.
However, many farmers see few alternatives to Trump.
""Even during those darkest days, his support among farmers only fell off about 5% so I think that it's not going to be hard for him to regain 5%,"" Republican U.S. Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said on Tuesday during a call with reporters. ""The good news has come since then.""
Poll respondents from agricultural areas said they also supported Trump due to the country's low unemployment rate, record highs in the stock market and his attempts to limit immigration.
About 35% of respondents from farm country said the federal government made it tougher for American farmers to succeed, down from 45% in September.
""I think he's trying to bring this country back to where it should be,"" said Susan Pavlish, 58, who describes herself as a farm wife in Crete, Nebraska. Her husband grows corn and soybeans across 1,200 acres.
Trump's standing also increased slightly among residents of coal-producing areas. About 40% of those respondents from top coal-producing states said they approved of the way Trump was handling the sector in December, up from 36% in September, while 38% disapproved, down from 43%.
Among those respondents whose livelihood is linked to manufacturing, 49% said they approved of Trump's handling of the industry, down from 52% in September. About 38% said they disapproved, up from 34%.
Industrial swing states such as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin that supported Trump in 2016 are now shedding thousands of factory jobs.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted between Dec. 17-23. It gathered responses from 4,441 adults in all, including 374 people who said they were personally employed as farmers, had immediate family members who were farmers or were employed in a business closely tied to the U.S. agriculture industry.
It also gathered responses from 549 people who were personally employed by American factories or had immediate family members who were, and another 533 people who lived in major coal-producing states including Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Illinois."

Hon Hai and its subsidiaries will hold a 50% stake in the venture, and Fiat Chrysler will hold the rest, the Taiwanese company said in an exchange filing. While the two companies have yet to sign a formal agreement, they plan to target the China market first and consider exporting cars later.
The two aim to ink the agreement in the first quarter, according to a person familiar with the matter, and Hon Hai’s Hong Kong-listed unit FIT Hon Teng will also be involved. A Fiat Chrysler representative didn’t immediately comment beyond the filing.
“Hon Hai will be responsible for design, components and supply chain management,” Chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg News in a text message, adding that the company will not get into car assembly. The manufacturer expects the automotive business to account for 10% of overall sales in the long run, according to Liu, and the new venture will have little impact on Hon Hai’s earnings this year.
Hon Hai and Fiat Chrysler are focusing on the China market because of sheer volume, Liu said. While consumers in the country buy more electric vehicles than anywhere else in the world, sales have slumped since the government pared back subsidies amid a broader-market downturn in demand.
Hon Hai relies on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). for about half of sales. Past attempts to diversify its product lines have not been entirely successful. The company tried to invest in a number of electric-vehicle ventures before, but none has borne any fruit."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - RWE (DE:RWEG), Germany's biggest power producer, will cut about 6,000 jobs, or nearly a third of its current workforce, by 2030 as the country moves to phase out brown coal as an energy source, the company said on Thursday.
Germany's exit from the coal industry marks the second major upheaval for RWE in as many years following the breakup of the .company's former subsidiary Innogy (DE:IGY) with peer E.ON (DE:EONGn).
It also accelerates RWE's transformation into a pure renewables group, which - along with its low valuation - could turn it into a takeover target, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said last week.
RWE said it would receive 2.6 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in compensation from the government over 15 years to soften the blow to its business.
However, this was less than the 3.5 billion euro hit it estimated it would take, even excluding the expected loss of profits, it added. 
""RWE stretches to the limits of what is possible,"" Chief Executive Rolf Martin Schmitz told journalists on a call. ""And we will bear the majority of the burden the German government demands for the coal phase-out.""
After months of wrangling, the German government early on Thursday agreed a compensation plan with energy companies, affected regions and workers to pay for the accelerated shutdown of coal-fired power stations by 2038.
RWE said it expected special writedowns of half a billion euros on power plants and open-cast mines as a result of the agreement. About 350 million euros will be set aside for personnel measures.
Shares in the group were 2% higher at 1508 GMT, the second-biggest gainers among German blue-chips, having earlier touched their highest since Sept. 25, 2014 as traders welcomed the clarity after months of wrangling.
""RWE's agreement with the German government lifts an important overhang,"" Bernstein analysts wrote.
""Some investors were cautious on whether RWE would be able to receive adequate compensation for early mine closures, given the past track record of negotiations with the government.""
Schmitz denied speculation that RWE may now seek to sell its coal assets, adding the firm, which is also Europe's third-largest renewable group after  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) and  Enel  (MI:ENEI), would stand by its employees.
""There are no such considerations and no talks on the matter,"" Schmitz said.
The company has in the past denied claims that its coal-fired plants are loss-making, saying it would not run them unless they generated cash.
Dave Jones, European electricity analyst at Sandbag, a non-profit think-tank, said that it had been clear that coal would have to be phased out even before the Paris Agreement to combat climate change was struck in 2015.

""It's a pertinent lesson for all other countries: deal with coal now, and save yourself a big bill in the future,"" he said.

Investing.com – Disney's streaming service Disney+ was launched just a few months ago, but signs that it carries a real threat to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have prompted bullish upgrades from Wall Street.
UBS raised its price target on Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) to $164 from $155 and Wolfe Research hiked its target on the stock to $175 from a previous $164. Disney was up 0.3% on the day.
The pair of upgrades come just a day after MoffettNathanson raised its target to $165 from $150 following the ""successful initial rollout of Disney+.""
Since its launch in mid-November, Disney+ has shown signs that it may well become a credible challenger to Netflix.
Disney+ grossed more than $50 million in its first 30 days. That not only topped revenue generated by rivals like HBO NOW and Showtime, but also was 71% of Netflix’s peak revenue in December.
The streaming service grabbed 34% market share in the fourth quarter, more than any other streaming service in the U.S., and 16% of the revenue market share.
But some have cautioned against optimism as the timing of Disney+ launch may have played a big role in the impressive start.
The new app launched just ahead of the holiday season, when consumers are less discerning with their spending and also have more time to spend with apps and games."

261,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 12:24PM ET</span>","Senate Passes USMCA, Giving Trump a Win Before Impeachment Trial","(Bloomberg) -- The Senate approved President Donald Trump’s U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement on Thursday, handing the president a major political win on the same day senators will be sworn in as jurors in his impeachment trial.
The Nafta overhaul, Trump’s top legislative priority for the past year, cleared the Senate on an 89-10 vote and now heads to the president for his signature. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement passed the House in December on a bipartisan 385-41 vote the day after the Democratic-led chamber voted to impeach Trump.
The Senate vote is also moving in tandem with the impeachment process, coming just a few hours before Chief Justice John Roberts is sworn in to preside over the trial. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell applauded the trade deal as a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation.
“A major win for our country. A major win for the Trump administration. A major win for those of us who are ready to move past this season of toxic political noise and get back to doing even more of the American people’s business,“ McConnell said on the Senate floor.
Political Win
Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, finally got behind the trade agreement in December after more than a year of wrangling with the Trump administration over changes to provisions regarding labor, the environment, pharmaceuticals and the overall enforcement of the deal. The changes won over Democratic senators like Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren who criticized previous free trade deals.
Some Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, still opposed the deal because it doesn’t explicitly mention climate change.
“Despite the fact that it includes very good labor provisions, I am voting against USMCA because it does not address climate change, the greatest threat facing the planet,” Schumer said in a statement before the vote.
A handful of free-trade conservatives like Pennsylvania GOP Senator Pat Toomey also voted against the agreement for creating new wage requirements in the auto industry, among other market interventions.
McConnell initially said the Senate wouldn’t act on the USMCA until it had finished with Trump’s impeachment trial, but Pelosi’s decision to delay sending the impeachment articles to the Senate created a window for the vote this week. The Senate Finance Committee and six other panels rushed to approve the deal since lawmakers returned from their holiday recess last week.
Passing this revision of the North America Free Trade Agreement gives Trump a victory to tout in his election-year State of the Union address scheduled for Feb. 4. While the USMCA is projected to add just 0.35% to GDP after six years, signing this agreement and the first phase of a China trade deal will relieve some economic uncertainty, helping Trump’s pitch to voters based on the strength of the U.S. economy.
For Democrats from narrowly divided or Republican-leaning districts, the USMCA allows them to show constituents that they’re working with the president and doing more than impeaching him. They have highlighted the labor enforcement provisions as a model for future free trade agreements."

Investing.com – The market was hesitant about retail sector at the close of trading yesterday after   Target   (NYSE:TGT) reported disappointing holiday sales.
But the spring was back in the step of retail investors Thursday after strong government numbers were backed up by a bullish report on holiday shopping from the National Retail Federation.
SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT) was up 1% in midday trading.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) gained 0.4%, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose 0.5%, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) was up 0.6% and TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) climbed 1.2%.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) lost another 0.9% today as it looked like more of the outlier in a overall strong holiday period.
Core retail sales, which exclude autos, popped 0.7% in December, the Commerce Department reported before the bell.
And holiday retail sales rose 4.1% to $730.2 billion from the same period a year ago, the National Retail Federation reported during trading.
That rise was at the high end of the NRF’s October guidance and well ahead of the 2.1% gain seen in 2018.
“This was a healthy holiday season, especially compared with the decline in retail sales we saw at the end of the season in 2018,” NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement. “Despite a late Thanksgiving and worries about tariffs, the consumer didn’t go away. We’ve had months of strong employment numbers, high wages and strong household balance sheets.”"
263,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 11:43AM ET</span>","FAA should mandate safety management systems for Boeing, others: panel","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An expert committee on Thursday recommended the Federal Aviation Administration require  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and other aircraft manufacturers to adopt new safety management tools in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people.
Boeing grounded its entire 737 Max fleet, halting deliveries of its best selling commercial airliner, after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed in March last year. It was the second 737 Max to crash in a matter of months. A Lion Air plane crashed in Indonesia in October, 2018. 
The expert panel, led by a retired Air Force general and a former head of the Air Lines Pilot Association, also called for improvements in how the FAA certifies new planes. It did not back ending the long-standing practice of delegating some certification tasks to aircraft manufacturers.
The panel, which was named by U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao in April, recommended the FAA mandate Safety Management Systems (SMS) for ""design and manufacturing organizations."" The FAA currently requires them for airlines.
The special committee report released on Thursday said ""unlike the current certification system's focus on compliance, SMSs foster a holistic assessment of whether the combinations of actions such as design, procedures, and training work together to counter potential hazards.""
Boeing's safety culture was harshly criticized last week after it released hundreds of internal messages about the development of the 737 MAX, including one that said the plane was ""designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys.""
Boeing in a statement said it ""will study these recommendations closely, as we continue to work with government and industry stakeholders to enhance the certification process.”
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson praised the recommendation to ""advance the use of Safety Management Systems throughout all sectors of the aviation industry,"" adding that the FAA will review the findings.
U.S. House Transportation Committee chairman Peter DeFazio last month said his panel's review of the fatal crashes found ""a broken safety culture within Boeing and an FAA that was unknowing, unable or unwilling to step up, regulate, and provide appropriate oversight of Boeing.""
The special committee said new aircraft testing ""should include multiple failure mode scenarios and involve trained pilots who reflect a representation of the anticipated end-users of the product.""
National Transportation Safety Board chairman Robert Sumwalt said in September that crews in the two fatal crashes ""did not react in the ways Boeing and the FAA assumed they would.""
On the two planes that crashed, a sensor fed faulty data to a key safety system known as MCAS designed to prevent stalls that repeatedly activated, pushing the nose down. One of the software updates being implemented by Boeing will prevent the system from activating more than once before a situation has been resolved.
The special committee said the FAA should propose to the International Civil Aviation Organization ""the sharing of operational data internationally to enhance safety.""
The report also said the FAA needs an ""aggressive recruitment campaign to encourage students to pursue careers at the FAA"" and should address ""concerns about potential undue pressure"" on Boeing employees conducting FAA certification tasks.

The Justice Department and Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General are both investigating the 737 MAX certification.

264,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley shares soar after Gorman boosts performance targets,"By Abhishek Manikandan and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) lifted its performance goals on Thursday after beating Wall Street estimates by a wide margin, the latest sign that Chief Executive James Gorman's strategic vision for the bank is bearing fruit.
In a presentation, Morgan Stanley set the bar higher for expense controls, returns on equity and wealth management profits over the next two years and beyond.
Analysts cheered the new targets, after repeatedly asking management when Morgan Stanley might upgrade them, since the bank was routinely meeting previous goals.
Investors cheered the news, with Morgan Stanley shares up 7%.
The bank posted its presentation after reporting a fourth-quarter profit beat that showed most of its businesses flourishing.
Bond trading, underwriting and investment management each produced much higher revenue, with M&A advisory being the only area to report a meaningful decline.
Overall, Morgan Stanley's profit jumped 46%, to $2.09 billion, or $1.30 per share, from $1.36 billion, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. (https://reut.rs/37b9508)
Analysts had expected a profit of 99 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The bank's net revenue rose 27% to $10.9 billion. It set new records for annual profit and revenue, and met or exceeded full-year performance targets Gorman laid out last January.
Since taking over a decade ago, the 61-year-old CEO has transformed Morgan Stanley from a Wall Street firm heavily weighted in money-losing trading businesses into a more balanced bank. He was the driving force behind Morgan Stanley's decision to acquire Smith Barney, and made wealth management the cornerstone of his plan to stabilize revenue.
Morgan Stanley's stock has risen about 79% during Gorman's tenure, while the S&P 500 Banks index <.SPXBK> and S&P 500 (SPX) have nearly tripled.
During an analyst call on Thursday, Gorman described the first five years of his tenure as a clean-up period after the financial crisis, and the second five as a time when he focused on growing businesses without sacrificing profitability.
Gorman noted that Morgan Stanley's wealth business now generates about three times as much daily revenue as it did five years ago, and its securities business has snatched market share from rivals at a time when industry revenue has shrunk.
(For a graphic on Morgan Stanley's institutional securites revenue, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2TrH94a)
'TRANSFORMED' BUSINESS
""We have meaningfully and with intent transformed this business into what it is today,"" he said. ""As we execute on the next phase of the firm's journey, the objectives listed here, assuming a normal market environment, should result as a natural consequence.""
Over the next two years, Gorman wants Morgan Stanley to hit an efficiency ratio of 70-72%. Over the long-term, he is hoping the bank can get to 70% or less.
That metric, which measures costs relative to revenue, is watched closely by investors as a symbol of whether a company spends wisely. Morgan Stanley met its prior goal of 73% or less in 2019.
Keeping costs under control will help the bank reach another metric Gorman set for returns on equity (ROE), which shows how profitably a bank uses shareholder funds.
Morgan Stanley now aims to produce ROE of 13-15% through 2022, and 15-17% after that. Its 11.7% ROE last year was within Gorman's prior targeted range of 10-13%.
Finally, he now wants the wealth unit to generate a pre-tax profit margin of 28-30% over the next two years, and 30% or more after that. The business's 27.2% margin last year was comfortably within the prior goal of 26-28%.
On the call, some analysts probed the assumptions behind those figures, asking what might happen if markets collapse. On the other hand, Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo - who has repeatedly pressed management to raise targets - asked why they should not be higher.
Gorman recalled a time when analysts were skeptical that Morgan Stanley could achieve much lower goals he had set, when its ROE was just 2-4% and its wealth margins were only 10%. He compared them to children in the back of a car asking, ""When are we going to get there?""
""What I've always tried to do with these targets is set a range where the bottom of the range is what we should be able to deliver in all normal circumstances,"" he said. ""The top of the range is obviously a little more sporty.""
Morgan Stanley is the last of the major U.S. banks to report results this week, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) posting similar trends in their Wall Street businesses.

However, its performance came in a stark contrast to its closest rival,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), which reported a profit decline on Thursday. Goldman is now in the middle of its own strategic turnaround, expanding into areas like consumer banking and corporate cash management to make profits less volatile.

265,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",Wall Street Analysts Still Shy Away From Tesla Bandwagon,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell in midday trading Thursday, which shouldn’t be a big surprise to anyone who’s been watching the stock lately.
The stock has nearly doubled in the last six months. Rallies do run out of steam and even the most bullish of bulls take some profits on a hot stock.
Shares were down about 3.4% due to a couple of reasons.
First, a report showed that the electric automaker’s sales in California nearly halved in the final quarter of 2019 as a ramp-up in tax credits for buyers of Tesla cars ended.
The second, a downgrade from   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) today, is more interesting.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) simultaneously downgraded the stock to underweight from equal weight and raised its price target to $360 per share from $250.
This kind of dichotomy happens when an analyst is caught flat-footed by a rally but still doesn’t like the stock, so the price target base is raised.
Morgan Stanley is still saying sell – its price target implies a drop of around 30% from where shares sit now around $500 – but don’t expect as much of a plunge as previously thought.
Here’s why Morgan analyst Adam Jonas said he is still pessimistic, according to Briefing.com.
""We downgrade Tesla shares to Underweight from Equal-weight based on (1) valuation, (2) unfavorable risk-reward, and (3) risks to the long-term Chinese business that may not be fully appreciated by the market.""
But Morgan Stanley isn’t alone among sell-side research in hesitation towards Tesla.
Among the 32 analysts polled by Investing.com, 12 had a sell rating or equivalent on the stock, compared with 11 buy ratings. Nine of the analysts were neutral.
The average price target for the stock is $312.60, a drop of more than 37% from the current price.
The highest price target is $734, with the lowest at $200."

(Reuters) - Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) shares fell 37% on Thursday after the company warned of lower 2019 profits and said it might have to write down significantly the value of its partnership with Airbus (PA:AIR) on A220 jets.
Bombardier, which sold control of the A220 to Airbus in 2018 as part of a long-running drive to raise cash and put it on a solid footing, said the venture needed more investment and might be subject to a writedown in fourth quarter results next month.
Under the terms of the deal, Bombardier could oblige Airbus to acquire its 33.58% stake in the program in 2026 for its market value or Airbus could oblige Bombardier to sell the stake.
Airbus, which has a 50.6% stake in the A220 program, said it remained committed to funding the jetliner on its way to profitability.
Bombardier said the program was ""winning"" with airlines, but latest indications were that it would need more cash to ramp up production, generate lower returns and take longer to break even.
""This may significantly impact the joint venture value,"" the Canadian company said. ""Bombardier will disclose the amount of any write-down when we complete our analysis and report our final fourth quarter and 2019 financial results.""
Bombardier is in the middle of a broader restructuring, focusing on its more profitable business jet and rail units.
It said delivery of four of its Global 7500 jets, a key revenue driver, had now slipped into the first quarter of 2020.
Faced with lingering problems at several projects in its rail division, Bombardier is weighing if it should direct cash aimed at the partnership toward paying down debt and bolstering rail, said a source familiar with the company's plans. ""It is a cash deployment question,"" the source said.
As of November, the Canada province of Quebec held a 16.36% stake in the A220 program.
A spokesman for Quebec's economy minister declined to comment. Free cash flow for 2019 is expected to be negative $1.2 billion, much lower than previously forecast negative $500 million.
Bombardier now expects 2019 adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to be about $400 million, compared with a previously forecast range of between $700 million and $800 million.
The company added it expects to incur a charge of about $350 million in the fourth quarter related to certain UK projects, negotiations with the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and higher production costs in Germany.
Bombardier shares were down about 37% at C$1.13 in early trade."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - U.S.-based financial firm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) is planning a joint bid with Brazil's fuel distribution company Raízen for refineries put on the block by Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4), two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Raízen, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L:RDSa) and Brazilian ethanol producer Cosan SA (SA:CSAN3), has presented non binding offers for the largest refineries put on sale by state-controlled Petrobras.
New York-based GIP manages over $50 billion in assets through its infrastructure funds, investing in sectors such as energy, transport, water and waste management.
If this consortium bid is successful, it will mark GIP's first investment in Brazil. Last year, it started raising a new fund for investments in emerging countries in Latin America and Asia.
Raizen, with more than 7,000 gas stations in Brazil and Argentina, also provides fuel for over 3,000 corporate clients. Still, refining in Brazil has been a Petrobras monopoly for decades.
Binding bids for the largest four refineries are expected for early March, and must be presented with the final composition of the groups, the sources added, seeking anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the talks.
Since November, when Petrobras selected four groups to deliver binding offers for the first four refineries, companies interested have been in talks to form consortia.
The groups that went to the second phase are Ultrapar Participações SA (SA:UGPA3), Raizen, United Arab Emirates' state investor Mubadala Investment Company and China's Sinopec.
Ultrapar and Mubadala are still in talks with potential partners, but no agreement has been reached yet, people with knowledge of the matter said. Sinopec is planning to present a bid alone.
Raizen and GIP declined to comment on the matter."

The Portuguese striker signed a four-year deal in 2018 at a reported annual salary of 30 million euros ($33 million). Italian media have suggested in recent weeks that the club is considering offering the 34-year-old a one-year extension.
Juventus could stop making a loss on an adjusted basis by 2023 if the high-spending team gets its transfer outlay under control, while making better use of its academy players, Marco Baccaglio, an analyst at French brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux SA, said in a report to clients. He started coverage on the shares with a hold rating and a price target of 1.30 euros.
The 100 million euro purchase of Ronaldo from Spain’s Real Madrid cemented the club’s place among Europe’s elite. But the Turin-based team’s spending splurge didn’t end with the five-time Ballon d’Or winner: Juventus spent 201 million pounds ($261 million) on footballers last year, according to the transfer statistics website transfermarkt.co.uk.
Alongside large transfer fees for other talents like former AFC Ajax N.V. defender Matthijs de Ligt, the club backed by the billionaire Agnelli family has used bumper pay packets to entice players to sign.
While Juventus paid no fee to London’s Arsenal F.C. for Welshman Aaron Ramsey when his contract expired last season, the midfielder is receiving a reported 400,000 pounds a week, making him the highest-earning British player ever, based on basic salary, according to the BBC.
“The strategy is proving particularly demanding, both in terms of costs and investments,” Kepler’s Baccaglio wrote. On the other hand, improvements to the club’s roster are triggering revenue growth that is “far from over.”
Core revenue could grow by 30% annually once current athletic performance, social media relevance, and team value are reflected in fundamentals, he said.
Juventus shares slipped as much as 1.1% on Thursday, despite the club progressing to the quarter finals of the Italian domestic knock-out tournament, Coppa Italia, on Wednesday, with a 4-0 victory over Udinese. Ronaldo didn’t feature after suffering from sinusitis, the club said on Twitter."
269,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 09:22AM ET</span>",Southwest extends 737 MAX cancellations through June 6,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) said on Thursday it is extending cancellations of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX flights until June 6, citing the planemaker's decision to recommend pilot simulator training before resuming flights and uncertainty about when regulators will approve their return to service.
The decision follows a similar announcement by American Airlines Co (O:AAL) earlier this week to extend cancellations until June 3.
The grounding of Boeing's best-selling plane, which came in March after a second deadly crash, now threatens a second summer travel season. The death toll for the two crashes, the first in Indonesia and the second in Ethiopia, was 346 people.
Southwest, the largest operator of the MAX worldwide, said it is now removing roughly 330 weekday flights from its more than 4,000 daily flights, which is 10% higher than in December when it said it was removing roughly 300 weekday flights through April 13.
Once the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gives 737 MAX approval to return to service, airlines will need at least 30 days to prepare the jets and its pilots for commercial flights, airline and union officials have said.
It is still unclear how much time the FAA may require pilots to spend in simulators before they can resume flights.
Reuters has reported the FAA will not approve the return of the MAX until February and it could slip until March or later. Last week, Boeing said it would recommend requiring all pilots to undergo simulator training before resuming flights, which may also push back the resumption of commercial flights.
Last month, United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) extended cancellations of its MAX flights from March until June 4.
Southwest said last month it reached a confidential compensation agreement with Boeing for a portion of a projected $830 million hit to 2019 operating income arising from the grounding of its 737 MAX aircraft and said it would share with its employees proceeds of about $125 million from Boeing.
The U.S. planemaker is revising the 737 MAX software to require a key safety system tied to both crashes to receive input from two sensors and has added significant additional safeguards.
Boeing and the FAA are still separately reviewing a wiring issue that could potentially cause a short circuit on the MAX.
The grounding is already having significant economic impacts. Boeing is halting production of the MAX this month and its biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR), said last week it plans to lay off more than 20% of its workforce in Wichita, Kansas."
270,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 09:16AM ET</span>",Ruby Tuesday to put Nestlé's plant-based Awesome Burger on its menu,"By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Casual dining chain Ruby Tuesday Inc said on Thursday it will test selling a plant-based burger from Nestlé SA-owned (S:NESN) Sweet Earth Foods, Nestlé's first national restaurant deal for its Awesome Burger.
Ruby Tuesday's said it will offer the burger at its approximately 450 U.S. restaurants through mid-March and then decide whether to make it a permanent addition to its menu.
Priced at $5 on Friday - and $10.99 thereafter - at the restaurants, the Awesome Burger is made from yellow pea protein.
Ruby Tuesday usually charges $8.99 for its classic hamburger. Nestlé began selling Awesome Burger patties in retail stores in October.
Sweet Earth joins  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) and Impossible Foods Inc in an increasingly competitive race to get their branded vegan proteins sold in well-known nationwide restaurant chains. But unlike its stand-alone rivals, Sweet Earth can dip into Nestlé's deep pockets and network of retailers, food service companies and ingredient suppliers as the world's largest food company.
Sweet Earth is in discussions with ""many other"" local, regional and national food service operators to put the Awesome Burger on menus, according to Fleur Veldhoven, vice president of food marketing at Nestlé Professional. She would not reveal the identity of future potential restaurant partners.
Some other chains are already selling the patty, though they have not used the Awesome Burger branding on menus, Nestlé said. Nestle decline to disclose those client names.
Ruby Tuesday has struggled in recent years amid industry declines in foot traffic, particularly at full-service restaurants. It closed at least 118 stores from 2017 through 2019 and the chain's U.S. sales dropped by 13% to $721 million in 2018, according to consulting and research firm Technomic Inc.
The formerly public company was sold to private equity firm NRD Capital in 2017.
Ruby Tuesday's corporate executive chef Carl Bertka told Reuters that the restaurant chose the Awesome Burger over competing plant-based patties in part because it can be cooked from frozen, which gives it a longer shelf life, limits waste and makes execution easier.
It can also be cooked using many different methods and is harder to overcook than some rival patties, and the texture and taste were appealing, he said.
Sweet Earth also sells a slightly different Awesome Burger and Awesome Grounds designed for retail consumers, which have ""been doing great"" and are expanding nationally since launch in October, Veldhoven said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. corporate reporting season is expected to show lackluster profit growth, and it has already gotten off to a bumpy start, with big banks kicking off the fourth quarter to mixed investor reaction so far on the stock market.
With the vast majority of the S&P 500 still yet to report, forecasters expect fourth-quarter earnings to be down 0.5% from a year ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""Q4 is probably the last quarter where the market kind of gives a pass to earnings,"" said Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston.
Among the large banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) reported results that beat expectations, while  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co missed.
Within the S&P 500, estimates vary widely for sector performance in the fourth quarter. Financials and utilities companies overall are expected to have tallied double-digit profit growth, while energy, industrials and consumer discretionary are seen reporting declines.
(GRAPHIC: Q4 earnings expectations, by sector: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001QXW9BER/eikon.png)
Many investors say they are more focused on corporate outlooks, with stronger 2020 profit growth needed to help justify big gains in the stock market. As of Wednesday, consensus analyst estimates called for a nearly 10% rise in earnings this year, according to Refinitiv.
""There is a lot more optimism priced into the 2020 numbers than there has been priced into the 2019 numbers,"" Lafferty said.
(GRAPHIC: 2020 earnings estimates, by sector: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001QXWBBEV/eikon.png)
With 2019 being a relatively sluggish year for profits, the stock market's ascent reflected a rising valuation on equities.
The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio has climbed from roughly 14 times to start 2019 to about 18 times by the end, an increase that investors attributed largely to interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.
Investors say such extensive P/E expansion is unlikely again this year, putting pressure on corporate earnings to come through.
“We expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,” LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch said in written commentary on Wednesday. “With valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.”
(GRAPHIC: US stock market valuation: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1075/1066/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Particular focus will be on results from market heavyweights Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which alone represent about 15% weighting in the benchmark S&P 500.
Those stocks, particularly Apple and Microsoft, contributed a significant chunk of the S&P 500's 31.5% total return last year, according to Goldman Sachs data.

Big U.S. banks that reported results earlier this week also highlighted the hit from lower interest rates after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut borrowing costs three times last year against the backdrop of the prolonged U.S.-China trade war.
""Although we continue to be negatively impacted by lower rates, a flat yield curve and low foreign exchange volatility, we remain intensely focused on carefully managing costs,"" interim Chief Executive Officer Todd Gibbons said in a statement.
Interest revenue at BNY Mellon fell 8% to $815 million in the fourth quarter, while non-interest expenses declined 1%. 
BNY Mellon has been investing in technology to automate most of its processes and cut costs, a strategy put in place by former Chief Executive Charles Scharf before he left to take up the top job at  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) late last year.
The bank, which manages money of clients such as big banks and hedge funds, said fee revenue rose 26% due to a gain from the sale of an unspecified investment. Fee revenue was flat excluding the one-time benefit.
Assets under custody and administration rose 4% to $37.1 trillion in the reported quarter, from the prior quarter.
The bank said net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $1.39 billion, or $1.52 per share, in the last three months of 2019, from $832 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier. (https://reut.rs/36YH8Jb)
Excluding items, the company earned $1.01 per share, missing expectations of $1.04, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Stobart said it had already invested 45 million pounds in Connect Airways, a consortium comprising the London-listed company, Cyrus Capital and Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, which acquired the assets of Flybe last year. 
Stobart holds less than a one-third shareholding in the consortium, which has to date provided 110 million pounds in funds to Connect Airways.
Flybe was rescued on Tuesday after the British government promised to review taxation of the industry and shareholders pledged more money to prevent its collapse. The agreement came a day after reports suggested it needed to raise new funds to survive through its quieter winter months.
As part of the plan, the government promised to review air passenger duty, a tax on flights departing from UK airports.
Stobart, which is now separate from the Eddie Stobart (L:ESLE) haulage business, said delays in getting regulatory clearance for the consortium's plans to buy Flybe's assets, coupled with a number of other factors including legacy issues, had affected its turnaround plan for the airline.
""This resulted in a situation in which a further injection of funds is required to ensure continued flying,"" Stobart said in a statement.
Roughly a year ago, Flybe was also approached by Stobart's former CEO Andrew Tinkler about an alternative financing proposal that challenged Connect's deal.
Flybe carries eight million passengers a year between 71 airports across the UK and Europe, according to its website. 
Since the rescue deal, details of which were not disclosed, British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) has filed a complaint with European Union regulators, calling it a ""blatant misuse of public funds"". 

Virgin Atlantic and Cyrus Capital did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for a comment on Thursday.

The latest promotion is available for a limited time at participating restaurants where diners can choose from the Impossible Whopper, spicy crispy chicken, crispy chicken and its signature Whopper sandwich.
Burger King, owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc's (TO:QSR) (N:QSR), was one of the first large fast-food chains to introduce a plant-based option and rolled out the vegan burger made with Impossible Foods' patty across the United States last August.
The Impossible Whopper is about $1 to $2 more expensive than a regular Whopper, based on the location of the restaurant."

PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said on Thursday there was a ""real desire"" within the top ranks of both companies for its alliance with Nissan to succeed, dismissing suggestions the partnership was on the rocks. 
Turmoil within the Franco-Japanese alliance, long dogged by internal rivalries, deepened following the November 2018 arrest in Tokyo of its architect and long-time boss Carlos Ghosn on charges of financial crimes, which he denies. 
Attempts to restore calm were dealt a fresh blow by Ghosn's dramatic flight from Japanese justice and a series of no-holds-barred allegations he has made from his refuge in Lebanon, including that he was the victim of a plot to oust him and that the alliance is now a ""masquerade"".
Nissan (T:7201) has vigorously rejected Ghosn's stance, while both the Japanese firm and Renault have tried to rubbish suggestions their two decades old partnership is falling apart. 
""We have a board overseeing the alliance which is made up of people who are all extremely in favor of the alliance,"" Renault Chairman Senard told a briefing with reporters. 
""There is a common desire to associate our strategic plans and a real desire to make this alliance a success,"" he added, dismissing a report that Nissan was examining scenarios for a possible future outside of the alliance as ""fake news."" 
The 66-year-old declined to comment on anything related to Ghosn, adding: ""I only think about the future.""
Renault shares were down 2% by 1123 GMT, underperfoming the broader auto sector which was down on news that Washington has threatened to impose tariffs on European car imports due to Europe's stance on Iran.
Renault's French rival and  Peugeot  maker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) also gave a flavor of some industry headwinds, reporting a 10% fall in its global sales last year as Chinese demand tanked.
Renault is due to publish its 2019 global sales on Friday.

JOINT PROJECTS 
Analysts see Renault-Nissan's cost-saving alliance as vital to both companies as the car industry battles a slowdown and huge investments in cleaner vehicles and automated driving, particularly as rivals PSA and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) are merging to help meet these challenges. 
Renault held ultimately unsuccessful talks to combine with Fiat Chrysler last year, which Ghosn described at a Beirut news conference as a huge missed opportunity. 
Senard, who chairs the alliance's operating board, said on Thursday that once the partnership has been rebooted, other firms might potentially want to join. 
The executive, who used to run tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), has become the de facto senior figure in Renault and Nissan's alliance, though without Ghosn's commander-in-chief aura, which had helped hold it together. 
While that is partly deliberate - both parties are keen to avoid another strongman situation and created a four-member operating board to oversee the alliance - Senard will now have to show he can push through new joint projects. 
He declined to give details of these beyond saying potential cost savings could be substantial, and that the alliance's board would meet soon to decide on its industrial plan. 
The meeting is scheduled for Jan. 30, a source close to Renault said. 
The firms are meanwhile finalizing a management revamp, with Renault close to appointing a new CEO after ousting Ghosn-ally Thierry Bollore in October. A new CEO started at Nissan in December. 
Luca de Meo, who recently stepped down as the head of Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Seat brand, is seen as the frontrunner for the Renault job, although a non-compete clause in his contract is proving a problem, sources have said. 
Interim CEO Clotilde Delbos is also in the frame. 
Senard said shaking up the shareholder structure in the alliance was not a priority for either side. 

Renault, which is part-owned by the French state, has 43% of Nissan, while the Japanese firm has 15% of the French carmaker, with no voting rights attached - a structure that has caused friction.

280,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>","Trump Asks JPMorgan Leader to Say ‘Thank You, Mr. President’","(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
A smiling President Donald Trump thanked some of the biggest U.S. companies for about 10 minutes on Wednesday at the White House, where he was celebrating his trade deal with China. When it came to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., he asked for reciprocation.
“They just announced earnings and they were incredible,” he said as he greeted Mary Erdoes, who heads asset and wealth management for the biggest U.S. bank. “They were very substantial. Will you say, ‘Thank you, Mr. President,’ at least, huh?” JPMorgan on Tuesday posted the most profitable year for any U.S. bank in history.
“I made a lot of bankers look very good. But you’re doing a great job.” He told her to “say hello” to the firm’s billionaire chief executive officer, Jamie Dimon. “I think we’re seeing him tomorrow.”
Trump has made a rollback of regulation and corporate taxes one of the hallmarks of his presidency. But his relationship with Dimon has fluctuated: In 2018, the JPMorgan CEO said he was smarter than Trump and could beat him in an election, but quickly backtracked.
Erdoes wasn’t the only major finance executive the president called out. Trump thanked billionaire Ken Griffin, who runs the hedge fund empire Citadel, but couldn’t spot him: “Where the hell is he? He’s trying to hide some of his money. Look, he doesn’t want to stand up.” Griffin wasn’t in the room, his spokeswoman said.
And Trump had a question for Moody’s Corp. CEO Raymond McDaniel: “Are you giving us good ratings, Raymond, please?”
There were other corporate figures at the White House, including Stephen P. Vaughn, a partner in international trade at law firm King & Spalding. “I could use some good legal advice. You have some good lawyers?” Trump said. “Eh, to hell with it. I just have to suffer through it the way I have all my life.”

Southwest, the largest operator of MAX airplanes worldwide, said the latest move would remove roughly 330 weekday flights from its total peak-day schedule of more than 4,000 daily flights.
The No.4 U.S. airline had previously canceled flights through April 13.
Airlines that own Boeing Co's 737 MAX are cancelling more than 10,000 monthly flights as the aircraft remains grounded following two deadly crashes in five months that killed 346 people.
The announcement comes days after No.1 U.S. airline  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) extended cancellations of the 737 MAX through June 3.
United Airlines Co (O:UAL) was the first to announce the cancellations in December.
Reuters has reported the Federal Aviation Administration will not approve the return of the MAX until February and it could be until March or later.
Last week, Boeing said it would recommend requiring all pilots to undergo simulator training before resuming flights, which may also push back the resumption of commercial flights."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks remained near record highs on Thursday, after the United States and China signed the first phase of an agreement to end their 18-month trade war.
MSCI's broadest index of world stocks was up 0.1%. London, Frankfurt, Paris helped Europe start stronger, after China's biggest stocks dipped overnight. (SS)
The deal signed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will roll back only some of tariffs that the two sides have been imposing on each other. The rest remain in place for what looks to be another tricky phase of talks.
""We believe the agreement underpins a positive outlook for risk assets, especially emerging-market stocks,"" said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer, UBS Global Wealth Management.
""But it is also important for investors to understand the limitations of the deal. So we see the deal as representing a partial calming rather than an end to trade tensions.""
Investors were also sizing up emerging-market central bank meetings in Turkey, South Africa and Egypt. Turkey was expected to cut interest rates further.
The European Central Bank was due to publish its December meeting, shortly before a speech by its president, Christine Lagarde. 
Also due to speak was Andy Haldane, one of the Bank of England's last holdouts against a rate cut. Weak UK inflation data had proved treacherous for the pound on Wednesday, so his view will be closely listened to. The pound was still weak at $1.30 and 85.4 pence to the euro. [/FRX] 
DONE DEAL, GET REAL
Japan's Nikkei ended 0.07% higher and China's Shanghai composite index fell 0.5% in its third day of losses. Hong Kong, Australia, India and Vietnam all gained.
Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 29,000 for the first time. (N)
""While the trade deal has provided a relief, there wasn't any positive surprises for markets. For shares to rise further, we need more evidences of improvement in the real economy and earnings,"" said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.
U.S. shares are now trading above 18 times expected earnings, near post-2008 financial crisis peak in 2018.
(Inflation Image: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/0100B4X22T6/inflation.png)
DISINFLATION EVERYWHERE
Bond yields dropped as a boost from the trade deal failed to offset low U.S. producer price data, which highlighted persistently low inflationary pressure. The price index rose less than expected in December to cap 2019 with rise of 1.3%, the lowest since 2015.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields slipped to one-week low of 1.780% compared with a high of 1.900% last Thursday and last stood at 1.80%.
Most euro zone bond yields were little changed, with German Bund yields just below two-week highs. The UK's 10-year gilt was yield near a two-and-a-half-month low at 0.65% on the talk of rate cuts..
The Swiss franc held firm. It had reached its highest against the dollar in over a year and its highest against the euro in almost three years after the United States added Switzerland to its watchlist of currency manipulators.
Washington's decision led traders to think it will become harder for the Swiss National Bank to intervene to weaken the franc in the future. The Swiss currency last stood at 0.9626 franc per dollar, near Wednesday's high of 0.9631.
The Chinese yuan was just below the five-and-a-half-month high it touched earlier this week after Washington dropped its currency manipulator label for China.
Among the main commodities, oil rose from Wednesday's six-week low, amid data showing big increases in U.S. refined products and hopes for more Chinese purchases of U.S. oil and gas.

Brent crude futures rose 0.7% to $64.45 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 0.73% to $58.23 per barrel. Gold was little changed at $1,555 an ounce.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 07:39AM ET</span>",Investors see smoother path for U.S. stocks as Warren's election odds slip,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders are less worried about political uncertainty in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, with former Vice President Joe Biden remaining strong in the polls while Senator Elizabeth Warren has lost ground.
Implied volatility, which measures expectations for outsized equity price moves, has fallen significantly in the past few months for healthcare, financials and energy - sectors considered at risk of disruption or increased regulation under a Democratic president.
The decline in expectations for volatility tracks the poll numbers for Warren, who is considered to be among the most left-leaning Democratic candidates. Warren's standing peaked in October, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, and has trailed off since then.
""We were seeing a lot more volatility in September, October, November, when the odds of Elizabeth Warren getting elected were higher,"" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. ""Joe Biden seems to be the market's safe candidate.""
Even a boost for Senator Bernie Sanders, another progressive candidate, has had little effect on implied volatility as Biden, seen as a moderate, has maintained a position at or near the lead in several polls.
GRAPHIC - Warren drops, volatility sinks: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1069/1060/Pasted%20Image.jpg
For instance, 30-day implied volatility for the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (P:XLV) has dropped to 12.2% as of Wednesday morning, from 18.9% in early October, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert.
""So much of the Iowa anxiety was coming at a time when Warren was trending higher,"" said Michael Purves, founder of Tallbacken Capital Advisors in New York, in reference to the Iowa caucuses, the first presidential nominating contest, on Feb. 3. ""That anxiety has dissipated.""
Jitters related to the Democratic presidential primaries have not entirely disappeared. CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) futures expiring in late February show a bump in expectations for volatility. The futures reflect the outlook for the month-long period following that date, which encompasses Super Tuesday on March 3, when several key states, including California and Texas, hold primaries.
Still, ""I would expect us to be seeing a lot more Super Tuesday positioning if there was some,"" Murphy said.
GRAPHIC - Positioning for U.S. election volatility: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1074/1065/Pasted%20Image.jpg 
Options markets may reflect greater anticipation of risk around the U.S. presidential election in November. 
Both VIX futures and the benchmark S&P 500 U.S. stock index (SPX) show a significant bump in implied volatility near the Nov. 3 vote, compared to either the preceding or following periods.

""Traders have already started pricing in a hefty election risk premium"" around November, wrote Mandy Xu, equity derivatives strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York, in a research note on Monday.

Investing.com - Wall Street is expected to open higher Thursday, continuing Wednesday’s record-setting pace upon the conclusion of the trade pact between the U.S. and China. Corporate earnings releases and retail sales data are in the spotlight.
Futures for the S&P 500 were trading 11 points, or 0.4%, higher by 7:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT), futures for the Nasdaq 100 contract were 36 points, or 0.4%, higher, while the Dow Jones 30 Futures futures contract was up 86 points, or 0.3%. These levels would result in intra-day record highs for all three indices.
On Wednesday, the U.S.S&P 500 rose 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.3%, closing above 29,000 for the first time. Stock market gains in January are on course to be the most in seven years.
Under the terms of the Sino-U.S. trade deal, the U.S. cut tariffs on $120 billion in Chinese goods to 7.5% from 15%. China agreed to increase purchases in the U.S. by $200 billion over the next two years in manufactured goods, agriculture, energy and services. 
Banks continue to release earnings, and the final quarter of 2019 has generally been a good one for the sector. Banking giant   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) offered up another beat on expectations, with revenues coming in at $10.9 billion, versus $9.7 billion expected and EPS at $1.30 versus $0.99. 
At 07:15 AM ET (12:05 GMT) Morgan Stanley’s shares traded 2% higher premarket, 
Elsewhere, shares of   Alcoa   (NYSE:AA) fell 2.6% premarket after the aluminum specialist reported a larger-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter and its sales came in below expectations.
Investors will also get another read on the health of the U.S. consumer with the release of the final retail sales report for 2019, at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT). Economists expect headline retail sales to have risen 0.3% during December, up from 0.2% in November. "
285,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 07:12AM ET</span>",Trade deal no panacea for rocky U.S. relations with China,"By Andrea Shalal and Cate Cadell
WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - From Huawei to the South China Sea, deep political rifts between Beijing and Washington are set to persist, despite a trade relations breakthrough, as the United States pushes back against an increasingly powerful and assertive China.
Relations between the world's two largest economies have deteriorated sharply since U.S. President Donald Trump imposed punitive trade tariffs in 2018, igniting a trade war.
""The broader, darkening picture is not going to be brightened much by this deal,"" Bates Gill, an expert on Chinese security policy at Macquarie University in Sydney, said of the initial trade deal signed on Wednesday.
This backdrop spans China's militarization of the South China Sea; rising tensions over Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own; U.S. criticism over human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang and a backlash against telecoms gear provider Huawei.
While the initial deal defuses an 18-month row that has hit global growth, experts say it is unlikely to provide much balm for broader frictions rooted in U.S. fears over an economically and technologically powerful China with a modernizing military.
""We can see Phase 1 as an emergency treatment to lower the temperature, but it has not addressed the fundamental problems,"" Wang Heng, a professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney who studies the China-U.S. economic relationship, said. 
HOSTILITY
Washington is increasingly alarmed about the security implications of Chinese technology, and has tightened its rules to keep better tabs on acquisition of key technology by China, setting in motion changes to the global supply chain. 
""The Chinese leadership are not naive about this,"" said Gill. ""They are already making moves to be more autonomous and thinking about a future ... in an environment of hostility.""
The Trump administration put Chinese telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co on a trade blacklist on national security concerns in May, banning it from buying supplies from American firms without U.S. government approval.
It has also taken measures to crimp exports of artificial intelligence software.
The two countries are also at odds over Taiwan, which counts the United States as its biggest weapons supplier but which China sees as one of its provinces. 
Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected on Saturday, vowing not to submit to Chinese pressure or control.
Tsai's campaign was helped by seven months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, which Beijing accuses Washington of helping to foment, eroding China's case for a ""one country, two-systems model"" similar to Hong Kong's for Taiwan.
U.S. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said last week that China ""will emerge as America's strategic threat"" and that the United States planned to deploy two task forces to the Pacific over the next two years capable of information, electronic, cyber and missile operations against Beijing.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Wednesday that the United States was concerned about other issues involving China but these should be dealt with separately. 

""You have to negotiate different pieces at different times"".

Wednesday's notice sought to recruit designers and other staff to help fulfill the goal, and called for applications by Feb. 1, but did not identify the center's location. 
""In order to achieve a shift of 'Made in China' to 'Designed in China', Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has proposed a very cool thing - set up a design and research center in China,"" it read.
It was not immediately clear when the center might begin operations, however. 
Tesla's first factory outside the United States is in the eastern city of Shanghai, and it started delivering China-made Model 3 vehicles this month.
Last week, Musk launched a Model Y electric sports utility vehicle program at the $2 billion factory, with an on-stage dance that raised an online storm. 
That was also the week that Tesla's stock market value hit nearly $89 billion, eclipsing the sum of General Motors' and Ford's values for the first time.

The stock move was fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at the new China factory and better-than-expected fourth quarter deliveries.

Widening of the investigation in Estonia adds to pressure on  Danske Bank , as the lender and its investors await a potentially much larger fine from U.S. authorities for its involvement in one of the world's biggest money laundering scandals.
""We are investigating more than 10 cases with a total amount of up to $2 billion,"" said a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general.
The prosecutor said it was previously looking into suspect money flows worth $300 million relating to two separate cases.
It declined to comment further on the status of those new cases, but said it was working together with a number of countries, including the United States. 
Danske, Denmark's biggest bank, admitted in 2018 that suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($223 billion) from Russia and elsewhere flowed through its branch in Estonia, triggering worldwide probes. 
""We of course continue to cooperate with the authorities and make ourselves - and the knowledge we have - available to the investigations,"" Danske said in a statement on Thursday. 
Danske, which was thrown out of Estonia and has said it would also exit the other Baltic states and Russia, also repeated an earlier statement saying it ""should never have had the now closed portfolio of non-resident customers in Estonia"". 
In 2018, Estonian authorities apprehended 10 former employees of the local Danske branch on suspicions of having facilitated a flow of dirty money through the branch.
Shares in Danske have lost more than half of their value since money-laundering allegations against the bank gained pace, but analyst Thomas Eskildsen at Handelsbanken said Thursday's development was ""marginal"" in a broader context. 
""It is a possible fine by the U.S. authorities that worries investors,"" he said.

John Iossifidis, who joined Noor Bank in the middle of 2017 and previously worked at Mashreqbank (DU:MASB), disclosed his departure in a memo to employees, the sources told Reuters.
The resignation came as shareholders of both Dubai Islamic Bank, the United Arab Emirates largest sharia-compliant bank, and Noor Bank approved the acquisition last month.
One of the sources said Iossifidis would continue to provide leadership in the short term and Dubai Islamic Bank's CEO Adnan Chilwan would then take charge until the integration of the two banks was complete.
DIB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Noor Bank officials were not immediately available to comment.
With the acquisition, DIB will become one of the largest Islamic banks in the world, with total assets worth 275 billion dirhams ($74.9 billion), from 230 billion dirhams as of the end of September.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Thursday warned against any ""nitpicking"" as Beijing portrayed the Phase 1 trade deal with United States and its new commitments to massive purchases of American goods as a boon for China's economy.
In return for some tariff relief, China agreed to buy at least $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services over two years, including $32 billion more in imports of U.S. farm products - targets some analysts say may be tough to meet.
In the world's most populous nation, coverage was tightly managed and the trade deal quickly dropped out of the top 10 trending topics on the Twitter-like Weibo platform.
A person who works in censorship at Chinese social media giant ByteDance and a senior official at a state-backed media outlet told Reuters they had been instructed only to use official reports on the deal - guidance that is not unusual for sensitive political news.
Official media and government statements were upbeat with the People's Daily saying that boosting agricultural imports will ""enrich the common people's dining tables.""
An article in the same publication which bore the pen name ""Zhong Sheng"", usually used to express its views on foreign policy, said the pact was in line with China's reforms, opening up and the push for high-quality growth.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Phase 1 agreement was good for both countries and the world when asked if he thought the deal was unfair.
China's Ministry of Commerce, which would normally comment on trade matters, earlier this week canceled its regular Thursday news briefing. 
Robust debate was, however, not encouraged. 
An editorial in the Global Times, a tabloid run by the People's Daily, stated that debating ""about who had lost or gained is shallow."" 
""We urge individuals and forces to exercise some restraint in their nitpicking of the agreement and bad-mouthing future trade negotiations,"" it said.
The deal comes at a welcome time for President Xi Jinping, who faces a slowing economy, unrest in Hong Kong, and the recent re-election of the pro-independence party's President Tsai Ing-wen in Taiwan, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. 
""That China hasn't been defeated completely is already in itself a success,"" he said.
Some people on both the U.S. and Chinese sides are not satisfied with the agreement, but that is a good thing, said a post by Taoran Notes, an influential WeChat account run by the Economic Daily.
A deal where just one side was happy would ""cause no end of trouble,"" it said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Thursday that a planned sovereign wealth fund to finance infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia's biggest economy will raise at least $20 billion once established.
Widodo discussed plans to establish the fund with Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed over the weekend during an official visit there.
Sovereign wealth funds are typically used by countries to direct funds from resource wealth such as oil, although Indonesia also plans to invite foreign investment into its fund.
""When the law presiding over this is issued, we'll have a minimum $20 billion inflow,"" Widodo told a financial industry event in Jakarta.
Widodo, who began his second term in office in October, is keen for an increase in foreign investment to help create jobs and boost economic growth, which has been stuck at around 5% for several years.
Discussions with the crown prince had included using the sovereign wealth fund to channel investment into the development of Indonesia's new capital city on Borneo island, according to Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Pandjaitan.
In an interview with Reuters on Jan. 8, Pandjaitan said the crown prince had agreed in principle to put money into the fund but needed Indonesia to pass a law to ensure legal certainty and then Jakarta would also put in cash and ""brownfield"" assets.
""When it's been established, anybody can join,"" said Pandjaitan, adding that the fund would be like an equity fund.
The minister said tech conglomerate Softbank Group Corp (T:9984) and newly established development financier the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) had also expressed interest in investing.
With low-lying Jakarta on Java island facing a range of pressures from congestion to flooding and pollution, President Widodo announced last August a plan to relocate government departments to a site in East Kalimantan on Borneo island.
To help attract investment, Indonesia has asked Abu Dhabi's crown prince, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Masayoshi Son, the founder of Softbank, to join a steering committee advising on the $33 billion plan to move the capital, ministers have said.
""Their role on the steering board is to oversee the development of the new capital,"" Indonesia's chief economic affairs minister Airlangga Hartarto told Reuters on Wednesday.
Planning minister Suharso Monoarfa said that Softbank was interested in providing self-driving vehicles for the capital.
In June, the self-driving car joint venture of SoftBank and Toyota Motor (T:7203) announced plans to begin operating in Southeast Asia this year.
A representatives for Softbank did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokeswoman for former prime minister Blair declined to comment."

WASHINGTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The long-awaited U.S.-China trade deal touted wins for U.S. companies looking to access China's $40 trillion financial sector, but many of the changes were already in the works, with Beijing having stepped up the pace of liberalization last year.
Under the deal, China has agreed to move forward by nine months a December 2020 deadline for removing foreign ownership caps on securities firms, which includes investment banking, underwriting and brokerage operations.
The Phase 1 trade deal, signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday, promises improved access to Chinese markets in banking, insurance, asset management, payments and fund management.
It aims to address a number of longstanding U.S. complaints about barriers to investment in China's financial sector, including foreign equity ownership restrictions, discriminatory regulatory requirements, and opaque licensing processes.
""China is very eager to get more private funds to invest in the economy"", to help fuel economic growth, said Andrew Collier, managing director of Hong Kong-based Orient Capital Research. But foreign companies will struggle to corner a bigger share of the market from state-owned and private Chinese rivals, he said.
The deal text said that by no later than April 1, China will remove foreign equity limits and allow U.S. investment banks to participate in local securities businesses.
Foreign banks' ownership cap in China securities joint ventures was lifted to 51% in 2018 from 49%. Lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration for global investment banks.
While Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) are awaiting regulatory nods to raise their holdings to 51% in their China securities ventures,  Citigroup  (N:C) plans to set up a wholly-owned securities business after agreeing last year to sell its stake in its previous joint venture.
JPMorgan (N:JPM) got final approval from regulators on Dec. 18 to set up a majority-owned securities venture.
As well as the headline initiatives, the agreement also goes into granular detail on a number of areas, and as a result ""feels more concrete than previous announcements,"" said Jane Jiang, a Shanghai-based partner at Allen & Overy.
""There are parts that seem to be written with specific companies in mind, and so we are almost certain that there will be takers for those openings as they must have lobbied for them,"" Jiang said. She cited as an example an adjustment to rules about foreign banks buying Chinese non-performing loans.
China has said the Phase 1 deal will boost imports of U.S. financial services. But a pledge to scrap foreign equity limits on firms operating in China's fund management, futures and insurance sectors will feel familiar to many.
""China has already been opening up its markets,"" said a Beijing-based lawyer, who works with Chinese regulators.
""The real test will be how quickly the applications and regulatory processes are handled.""
Last July, Premier Li Keqiang announced China would expedite by a full year its plans to allow 100% foreign ownership in a raft of financial sectors.
    Foreign ownership limits in futures companies were scrapped this month, while China said last year that it would do the same for mutual funds by April 2020. A 51% cap on ownership in life insurance ventures was also removed this month.
Likewise, China's pledge on Wednesday to open up its payments system to U.S. firms comes after its central bank said it had accepted an application from an  American Express  Co (N:AXP) unit regarding starting onshore operations.
Ken Bentsen, CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which has criticized China for failing to make good on past promises to level the playing field, struck a cautious note on Wednesday's deal.
""We will examine this agreement closely including what it specifically means for our members in terms of its implementation and enforcement,"" he said in a statement."
295,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 05:04AM ET</span>",StockBeat: RWE Hits 5-Year High as German Coal Exit Nears,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Germany is finally getting serious about giving up coal – and the companies that burn it are doing very nicely out of it, thank you.
RWE, the biggest generator of coal-fired electricity in the country, hit its highest level since September 2014 on Thursday on reports that it will get as much as 2.6 billion euros in compensation to close down its last coal plants, around 600 million euros more than had previously been mooted.
By 5 AM ET (1000 GMT), RWE (DE:RWEG) was up 1.8%, the second-best performing stock in a DAX index that was drifting 0.1% lower as the afterglow of the U.S.-China trade truce faded. The benchmark Stoxx 600 index was flat at 419.46.
The reports, which have not yet been officially confirmed, follow a breakthrough agreement at the political level overnight on Wednesday, where Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed a 40 billion euro ($45 billion) aid package with the premiers of four states where coal mining is still a large part of the local economy.
The political agreement is another step on a painfully long and winding road to reinvention for RWE, a product of Germany’s confused response to Climate Change. Merkel effectively committed Germany to generating coal power for another 30 years when she accelerated the closure of the country’s nuclear plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011. By contrast, the U.K., which has allowed its nuclear plants to run to the end of their natural lives, has all-but completely weaned itself off the energy source that produces more greenhouse gases than any other.
The political agreement struck last night brings forward the scheduled date for exiting coal – the catchily-named Kohleausstieg – to as early as 2035. The compensation, if confirmed, will remove further uncertainty from RWE’s financial outlook and smooth the path for it to unlock more value for shareholders by spinning off its substantial renewable assets into a separate company. That’s if it can stomach more restructuring after a complex asset swap with rival E.ON (DE:EONGn) over the last two years.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts noted last week that RWE, which is already Europe’s third-largest generator of renewable power, could become a takeover target, given the attractiveness of its renewable assets and its cheap current valuation (its enterprise value is only seven times EBITDA, compared to around 14 for Danish wind farm operator Oersted (CSE:ORSTED). The shares have tripled from their low point in 2016 but are still worth only one-third of their pre-crisis peak.
It would be unlikely for Germany to smile on a foreign takeover of RWE, given its strategic importance to the economy and its roots in local energy supply. But with asset management Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) earlier this week predicting a “profound” reallocation of global capital driven by sustainability and Climate Change concerns, the potential for a strong tailwind for RWE shares is certainly there."
296,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 04:34AM ET</span>",Carlos Ghosn's Japanese lawyers quit after former Nissan chief absconds,"By Tim Kelly and Chang-Ran Kim
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese attorneys representing Carlos Ghosn, including lead lawyer Junichiro Hironaka, quit on Thursday following the former Nissan chief's flight to Lebanon from Japan, where he had been fighting financial misconduct charges. 
In an emailed statement, Hironaka said everyone involved in the case at his practice had resigned. A spokeswoman there declined to give a reason.
A second lawyer in Ghosn's three-person legal team, Takashi Takano, also quit on Thursday, according to an official at his office. 
A person who answered the telephone at the office of the third lawyer, Hiroshi Kawatsu, said she did not know if he still represented the former automotive executive. 
Ghosn, who fled Tokyo last month, told Reuters in an interview in Beirut with his wife Carole that he was happy to stay in Lebanon for the rest of his life and claimed he was treated with ""brutality"" during his detention and bail in Japan.
Carole said she was ""done with Japan"".
Japan has issued international wanted notices for the couple, which means the two will live in Lebanon as fugitives and could be arrested if they leave their country. 
Hironaka, who earlier expressed disappointment at his client's decision to abscond, had said he would quit once Ghosn had settled his account.
The case has cast a harsh light on Japan's justice system, igniting a fierce publicity battle between the former businessman and Justice Minister Masako Mori, who has described Ghosn's criticism as ""absolutely intolerable.""
Ghosn spent more than 120 days in a Tokyo detention center and was interrogated on most days, often for more than seven hours without his lawyers, Takano has said.
Prosecutors questioned him for the first 43 days without a break, including Christmas and New Year's Day.
On Thursday, Ghosn found an ally in another foreigner, Australian sports journalist Scott McIntyre, who was detained for 44 days for trespassing in a bid to get information on his missing children. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was freed on Wednesday with a six-month suspended sentence.
Speaking at a news conference, McIntyre, who was held at the same detention center as Ghosn in western Tokyo for part of his detention, described the conditions there as ""torture"".
Japanese officials reject such criticism, saying the justice system is humane and protects human rights.

McIntyre said the lights were on 24 hours a day, making it impossible to sleep more than an hour at night, and that several of his fellow detainees told him they would confess to crimes they had not committed in order to shorten their time there.

(Reuters) - European shares rose on Thursday after the United States and China signed an eagerly awaited Phase 1 trade deal, giving some relief to markets that have been roiled by the 18-month standoff between the world's two-largest economies.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.3% by 0857 GMT. 
The deal, signed in Washington on Wednesday, still raises questions over daunting purchase commitments of U.S. goods by China, while leaving existing tariffs in place.
However, the prospect of no further escalation in the economically damaging trade war encouraged a slight risk-on mode.
""The details that were released after the signing were pretty much in line with what markets expected. There wasn't anything suggesting that the deal would over deliver,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist with Capital Economics in London. 
European utility stocks (SX6P) touched their highest levels since late-2008 on strength in power generator RWE AG (DE:RWEG). Shares of the company rose amid reports that the German government plans to compensate RWE with around 2.6 billion euros ($2.9 billion) for costs related to the country's planned coal exit.
The European retail subindex (SXRP) gained 0.6%, led by an 11% rise in German meal-kit delivery company HelloFresh (DE:HFGG) after it flagged a stronger 2019. 
The stock was also the best performer on the STOXX 600.
German shares (GDAXI) rose 0.4% after closing lower a day earlier on dismal GDP data.
Economic growth in the euro zone's largest economy slowed sharply in 2019, highlighting the widespread impact of the trade war on demand for exports from the manufacturing-heavy country.

Oil and gas stocks (SXPP) rose, tracking a rise in oil prices as the trade deal pointed to more Chinese purchases of American energy products, while a drop in U.S. crude inventories also helped.

Opaque procurement processes and the dominance of giant state-owned Chinese companies mean European companies get only ""crumbs from the table,"" the European Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report.
It said the European Union should move to force Chinese companies that access the EU procurement market to operate under the same restrictions that EU companies do in China. 
""If the EU fails to play an active and competitive role, there is a real danger that it could eventually become little more than a peripheral market tacked on to the end of Eurasia,"" the Chamber of Commerce said.
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) seeks to build a modern version of the Silk Road to link China with Asia, Europe and beyond through large-scale infrastructure projects that it has launched in more than 60 countries since 2013. 
European companies are merely ""niche players"" in the BRI, with just 20 chamber members of 132 survey respondents reporting that they had bid on BRI projects, chamber President Joerg Wuttke told reporters on Monday ahead of the report's release.
Those European companies that did get involved did so mainly through Chinese business partners or the government, and usually their role was to provide specific technologies or expertise that the Chinese side lacked, the report said. 
Both Chinese and foreign companies can participate in BRI projects through open, transparent means, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily briefing in Beijing on Thursday. Many European firms have participated in the BRI, he said. 
Chinese national champions were also gaining ""monopolistic power"" in some BRI countries by building digital infrastructure that involved complete packages of software and hardware based on Chinese standards, according to the Chamber's report.
Such companies benefited from heavy state support at home, which helped them beat international competitors. 
""Smaller, less developed countries that do not have the capacity for setting their own standards will certainly be put under considerable pressure to simply adopt Chinese standards,"" the report said. 

The EU needed to allow its own companies to scale up by reviewing its competition law, it said. The EU's own infrastructure initiative, the ""Connectivity Strategy,"" should also be prioritized as a ""credible alternative"" to the BRI.

Shares in   Pearson   (LON:PSON) slumped 10% as the publisher announced the departure of its chief financial officer and a weak performance in its U.S. education division. It also said it expects profits to fall next year.
Shares in   Whitbread   (LON:WTB) also dropped 3.7% after the owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain reported weak revenue in its fiscal third quarter, blaming Brexit-related uncertainty. Recruitment specialist Hays also fell 2.8% after its fiscal second quarter was hit by French strikes, U.K. elections and Australian bushfires.
In Europe, shares in utility RWE AG (DE:RWEG_p) climbed 1.7% following reports Thursday that the German government plans to compensate the utility with around 2.6 billion euros for costs related to the country’s planned coal exit.
On Wednesday, the U.S.S&P 500 had risen 0.2%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.3%, closing in record territory above 29,000. That accompanied the signing of the much-anticipated phase one trade agreement between the U.S. and China, pausing their two-year trade war that had weighed on global growth.
Looking ahead, the European Central Bank is due to publish the account of its last monetary policy meeting, held in December, at 7:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). At the meeting, the first presided over by new President Christine Lagarde, the Governing Council decided to leave its key rates and quantitative easing program unchanged.
Elsewhere, oil climbed, boosted by the signing of the trade deal as well as U.S. crude inventories falling by more than expected. These inventories fell by 2.5 million barrels, compared with analyst expectations of a drop of 500,000 barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Energy.

The latest support for stocks comes ahead of the Turkish central bank’s rates meeting, with economists estimating a 75 basis-point reduction in benchmark rates. That would add to 1200 basis points of cuts since July.

By Kim Khan 
1.   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) Leads More Financial Earnings
Another batch of financial company earnings comes tomorrow. This weeks results have been mostly positive, but with a few big-name exceptions like   Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) will weigh in ahead of trading.
Analysts are looking for a profit of $1.03 per share on revenue of about $9.7 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
But there’s already some hesitation about the numbers. JMP Securities downgraded  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) shares to market perform from outperform on Monday.
JMP said Morgan Stanley’s results are tied to the market backdrop and is growing from a large base in wealth management. That could make management hesitant to “push the goalposts much, if at all” when it updates guidance when reporting earnings.
Also reporting is Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), which is expected to earn $1.39 per share and revenue for $4.24 billion.
  Charles Schwab   (NYSE:SCHW) is also on the calendar. The consensus forecast is for a profit of 64 cents per share, with revenue seen coming in at $2.6 billion.
2. Retail Sales in Focus After   Target   (NYSE:TGT) Miss
There will be economic indicators aplenty for investors to digest now that phase one of a trade deal between the U.S. and China is finally in the rearview mirror.
Retail sales will be of special interest after  Target  (NYSE:TGT) spooked the sector with disappointing holiday sales.
The Commerce Department will report on December retail sales at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists predict that retail sales rose 0.3% last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Core retail sales, which exclude autos, are seen up 0.5%.
At the same time, the Labor Department releases weekly initial jobless claims.
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to have ticked up to 216,000.
3. Philly Fed Seen Rebounding Slightly
Also at 8:30 AM ET there will be more information on whether manufacturing remains the weak spot for the U.S. economy.
The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for January is expected to rise to 3.8, according to economists’ forecasts.
At 10:00 AM ET, the November numbers on business inventories arrive.
Economists are looking for a drop of 0.1% for the month.
Also at 10, the National Association of Home Builders will release its measure of housing activity for January
The NAHB housing market index is forecast to edge down to 74 from 76 in December."

Primark owners Associated British Foods (LON:ABF) said revenue for the 16 weeks to Jan. 4 was up 4% on the previous year and its outlook remained unchanged. 
Thanks to three new stores in Europe and an expansion in existing stores, sales for the final quarter were up 4.5% for the group’s Primark business. Primark intends to open its first stores in several eastarn European countries in 2020. 
Revenues from ABF’s sugar business increased by 7% in 2019 due to an increase in sugar prices and better quality beet crop. 
Recruitment specialist   Hays   (LON:HAYS) said it expects first-half operating profit to fall around 20% to 100 million pounds due to difficult trading conditions in key markets.
Revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending in December fell 4% on the year on a like-for-like basis, as French strikes, Australian bushfires and the U.K. general election and uncertainty over the direction of Brexit all weighed on hiring.
Net fees from Germany also fell 9% on the year, as “increased client cost controls and reduced overall business confidence across multiple sectors.”
“Overall, we expect near-term macro conditions to remain difficult,” CEO Alastair Cox said.

Publishers    Pearson    (LON:PSON) said growth for 2019 was flat as a result of a drop in its U.S. business. It also said CFO Coram Williams (NYSE:WMB) is to leave the company for a comparable role in Europe. Williams will be succeeded by Deputy Chief Financial Officer Sally Johnson, who has been with the company since 2000. 
Revenue in U.S. educational courseware, which makes up almost a quarter of the business, fell by almost 12%. The company saw modest growth in digital revenue but a continued decline in print.

""The use of external security companies is not a supervisory issue per se,"" Thomas Bauer, chairman of FINMA said. ""In this case, however, we still have unanswered questions about governance, such as documentation, control, information behavior and communication channels,"" he told Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.
""For us it [the Credit Suisse spying affair] is a case about which we still have questions,"" Bauer added.
Credit Suisse admitted last month to spying on another of its former executives, deepening a scandal at the Swiss group which is already under investigation for putting its ex-wealth management chief under surveillance.
Switzerland's second-largest lender blamed former chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee for hiring detectives in February to track then HR boss Peter Goerke.
It described a rogue operation in which all executives and directors, including Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam, were kept in the dark about what was going on.
Credit Suisse had earlier blamed Bouee for a similar incident involving former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan and had also cleared Thiam of any role in it. At the time, Thiam characterized it as an ""isolated incident"".
FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has appointed an independent investigator to look into the affair.
Bauer said the investigation would clarify the picture for FINMA, adding the affair which has rocked Switzerland's financial center, could damage the industry's reputation.
""The first step of the investigation is to answer our open questions,"" Bauer said. ""Whether or not there will be regulatory consequences remains open."""

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to push higher at the open Thursday, taking their lead from the positive close on Wall Street overnight, with the signing of the trade deal between the U.S. and China being well received
At 02:05 ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 37 points, or 0.3% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 17 points, or 0.3%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. climbed 17 points, or 0.2%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, rose 12 points, or 0.3%.
On Wednesday, the U.S. S&P 500 had risen 0.2%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.3%, closing in record territory above 29,000. That accompanied the signing of the much-anticipated phase one trade agreement between the U.S. and China, pausing their two-year trade war that had weighed on global growth.
Under the terms of the deal, the U.S. cut tariffs on $120 billion in Chinese goods to 7.5% from 15%. China agreed to increase purchases in the U.S. by $200 billion over the next two years in manufactured goods, agriculture, energy and services.
Despite the gains on Wall Street overnight, some still regard the deal as fragile.
“The question is whether it is really feasible to create additional demand for U.S. goods equal to US$150 per Chinese citizen over the next two years,” ING analysts Timme Spakman and Iris Pang said in a research note. “Especially as the growth of the Chinese economy is structurally on a downward trend and authorities want to continue the fifteen-year trend of declining import growth.”
That said, “the deal takes away some of the trade uncertainty that affected businesses in the past two years,” ING added.
In Europe, the car industry body ACEA reported that new car registrations leaped 21% in December, albeit the figures were flattered as companies used aggressive promotional schemes to clear old stock before tough EU new emissions rules came into effect at the start of the year. 
Also of note, the European Central Bank is due to publish the account of its last monetary policy meeting, held in December, at 7:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). At the meeting, the first presided over by new President Christine Lagarde, the Governing Council decided to leave its key rates and quantitative easing program unchanged.
Elsewhere, oil climbed, boosted by the signing of the trade deal as well as U.S. crude inventories falling by more than expected. These inventories fell by 2.5 million barrels, compared with analyst expectations of a drop of 500,000 barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Energy. 
At 2:05 AM ET (07:05 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% at $58.16 and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $64.36. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX dropped 0.1% to $1,553.20."

Investor interest in strategies that adhere to ESG standards has been rapidly growing. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). unveiled a plan on Tuesday to put climate change issues at the center of its investment strategy for the roughly $7 trillion of assets it manages. A survey last year found that 95% of fund managers globally have adopted, or plan to adopt, ESG criteria.
MSCI analysts including Linda-Eling Lee identified the following key themes for 2020 in a report earlier this month.
As an example of the kind of data investors might exploit to find climate change innovators, MSCI cites patent filings. The analysts note that the largest filers of low-carbon patents over the past five years include such corporate giants as Toyota Motor Corp., LG Chem Ltd. and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.
“Companies with the most resources and large R&D budgets (more likely to file more patents overall) could also become the most capable of introducing efficient low-carbon solutions into the market,” the analysts said.
MSCI has launched multiple gauges focusing on ESG and climate change over the last few years. Earlier this month, It added 15 fixed-income ESG- and factor-based corporate bond indexes to its gauges “to meet investor demand”."

(Reuters) - Korea's Hyundai Group is backing a UK electric vehicle startup that plans to begin selling battery-powered delivery vans in 2021, the companies said on Thursday.
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and sister firm Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) are making the investment of 100 million euros ($110 million) in Arrival Ltd.
Founded in 2015 and based in London, Arrival has developed a boxy, futuristic-looking shuttle bus aimed at the commercial delivery market. The company said its van will have a range between charges of 300 miles.
In a statement, Arrival said it will work with Hyundai and Kia to develop a variety of electric vehicles, initially for the commercial market. Those vehicles will be built on Arrival's modular vehicle platform or ""skateboard"" that bundles motor, batteries and chassis components, similar to the skateboard developed by U.S. startup Rivian.
Rivian is backed by  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Amazon (O:AMZN), and has a contract to build 100,000 electric delivery vans for the e-commerce giant, starting in 2021.
Hyundai and Kia last year invested $89 million in Rimac Automobili, a nine-year-old Croatian company aspiring to build electric supercars that is also backed by Porsche AG (KS:000270).
Arrival said its vehicles will be equipped with advanced driver assist features and can be upgraded with self-driving systems.
The vehicles are designed to sell for the same price as similar models powered by internal combustion engines and to be built in small ""microfactories."" That strategy is the opposite of U.S. electric vehicle rival Tesla (O:TSLA) which uses massive ""gigafactories.""
Last fall, Arrival, which until now has operated largely in stealth mode, hired General Motors (N:GM) veteran Michael Ableson to head its new North American operations.
With a small factory in Banbury, England, Arrival said it now has 800 employees in five countries, including Germany, Russia and Israel.
Arrival previously said it would use BlackBerry's (TO:BB) QNX operating system to connect safety features in its electric vehicles.
Arrival said its prototype delivery vans are being tested by the  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG), DHL and UPS."

The Chinese telecom equipment maker said on Thursday it planned to issue 381.098 million A shares, or 8.27% of the total issued share capital on completion of the deal, to independent third party investors at 30.21 yuan apiece.
That represents a discount of 18.2% to ZTE's A-share closing price of 36.92 yuan in Shenzhen on Wednesday.
The A shares, which are subject to a lock-up period of 12 months from the date of listing, will be issued to 10 independent professional or institutional investors in China.
None of the subscribers will become a substantial shareholder upon completion of the share sale, the company said, without providing further details.
The company had not responded to an email request for comment on details and identity of the investors.
""We believe the successful fund raising will remove a key overhang for the stock, and would give investors more confidence in ZTE's R&D efforts and thus potential share gain in 5G,"" brokerage Jefferies said in a research note.
""Our fundamental view remains negative, but near-term stock price could have support,"" Jefferies said, adding it worried about margin pressure and market share pressure on 5G.
ZTE's Shenzhen-listed shares rose as much as 4% to 38.10 yuan in early trade. Hong Kong-listed stock briefly rose 3.7% to HK$28.05, the highest since March 2018.
""It is because of the lock up period which give investors confidence of a stable stock price during the period, and that support the shares from advancing despite the discount,"" said Steven Leung, a sales director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.
""Its a vote of confidence to the prospect of 5G and related companies,"" Leung added.
ZTE said the deal will enable it to maintain its high level of investment in R&D, ensure its technological competitive edge, develop its main products and businesses, as well as help increase its market share in the mainstream markets."
310,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 11:02PM ET</span>","T-Mobile/Sprint urge court for deal approval, states warn of price hikes","By Arriana McLymore and Sheila Dang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of U.S. states suing to block T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc from merging with Sprint Corp on Wednesday told a federal judge that the deal would raise prices for consumers, while the phone companies pushed back and emphasized they would compete aggressively to push prices down. 
The states filed a lawsuit in June to block the merger, saying it would harm low-income Americans in particular.
T-Mobile and Sprint contend that the merger would enable the combined company to compete more effectively with dominant carriers  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T). 
U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero, who will decide the fate of the merger, heard closing arguments in the case on Wednesday. Marrero did not ask any questions of either party and said he would make a decision ""as promptly as possible.""
Glenn Pomerantz, a lawyer for the states, said that the case would impact at least 130 million customers, since a merger would leave the United States with three major phone carriers instead of four.
""If this merger goes forward, they're at risk for paying billions of dollars more every single year for those services,"" he said.
When T-Mobile majority shareholder Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) first contemplated the deal in 2010, it ""expressly and unambiguously admitted that it had potential to reduce price competition,"" Pomerantz said. 
David Gelfand, an attorney representing T-Mobile, said in his closing statement that the merger would offer cost savings, which would trickle down to lower prices for consumers. 
The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July after the carriers agreed to sell some assets to satellite provider Dish Network Corp, which would create its own cellular network to ensure that there would still be four competitors in the market. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October. 
Executives from the companies, including outspoken T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere, testified during the trial that Sprint's business was deteriorating and would not survive if it did not merge with T-Mobile.
The carriers argued that selling Sprint's prepaid business and some wireless spectrum to Dish Network Corp would help the satellite TV provider become a mobile competitor and preserve a fourth wireless company in the industry.
The states, led by New York and California, maintained that Dish was ill-equipped to become a competitive fourth wireless carrier, and said Wednesday that Dish lacks experience, scale and brand recognition in wireless.
In rebuttal, Pomerantz emphasized that Sprint could turn itself around the same way T-Mobile had previously when it launched 4G technology.

""They're not in a dire position; they're in an advantageous situation and they just need to invest in their business and compete,"" he said.

Investing.com - Japan-listed Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) is investing $394 million in Joby Aviation, a U.S.-based air-taxi startup that has reportedly spent the last ten years designing an electric air-taxi prototype. 
 
Toyota is the lead investor in Joby’s $590 million Series C funding, according to Bloomberg. Other investors include Baillie Gifford and Global Oryx and prior backers Intel Capital, Capricorn Investment Group, JetBlue Technology Ventures, SPARX Group.
 
“Air transportation has been a long-term goal for Toyota, and while we continue our work in the automobile business, this agreement sets our sights to the sky,” said Toyota President and Chief Executive Officer Akio Toyoda. “As we take up the challenge of air transportation together with Joby, an innovator in the emerging eVTOL space, we tap the potential to revolutionize future transportation and life.”
 
Joby recently released an image of its prototype aircraft, which is said to be able to fly 150 miles on a single charge at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. It’s designed to carry four passengers and a pilot, the company said.
 
The news came after South Korean automaker Hyundai announced plans earlier this year to design and produce an air taxi with Uber Technologies. "

China’s Shenzhen Composite rose 0.2%, while the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.4%.
 
Overnight, officials from the U.S. and China signed the phase one trade agreement, putting their two-year trade conflict on a pause. 
 
“This is a very important and remarkable occasion,” U.S. President Donald Trump said during the signing ceremony at the White House. Fixing what he sees as the injustices of past trade deals is “probably the biggest reason why I ran for president,” he added. “Together we are righting the wrongs of the past.”
 
Under the terms of the deal, the U.S. slashes tariffs on $120 billion in Chinese goods to 7.5% from 15%. In exchange, China agreed to increase purchases in the U.S. by $200 billion over the next two years in manufactured goods, agriculture, energy and services.
 
However, gains were limited as some analysts called the deal “fragile” as it includes an option for China to exit the trade deal should the U.S. re-impose tariffs. 
 
“There will be continued tension over China—over cyber, over national security, over human rights. Those issues aren’t going to go away, but those issues don’t really matter to the earnings of the S&P 500 companies the way an escalation of tariffs would,” said Daniel Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas, in a CNBC report.

The massive drop comes as tax credit for Tesla buyers ended in 2019. It had fallen to $3,750 at the start of the year and had halved to $1,875 in July.
An existing $7,500 U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs), which allows taxpayers to deduct a part of the cost of buying an electric car, phases out over 15 months once an automaker hits 200,000 cumulative EV sales, which Tesla hit in July 2018.
The report released on Wednesday showed registrations in California, a bellwether market for the electric-car maker, plummeted 46.5% to 13,584 in the quarter ended December 2019, from 25,402 in the same period a year earlier.
Model 3 registrations, which accounted for about three-fourth of the total, halved to 10,694.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
""One can assume that Tesla has hit peak performance in the U.S. because they have not exceeded their 2018 results for five months now,"" said Shane Marcum, vice-president of Cross-Sell.
The new data comes nearly two weeks after Tesla beat Wall Street estimates for annual vehicle deliveries and met the low-end of its own target, sending shares to a record high in a vindication for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk after a few turbulent years."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday revoked Michael Avenatti's bail after the celebrity lawyer and critic of U.S. President Donald Trump was accused of hiding money from creditors, triggering a delay in a separate trial where Avenatti is charged with trying to extort  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE).
U.S. District Judge James Selna remanded Avenatti to federal custody at a hearing in Santa Ana, California, where prosecutors had charged him last March with stealing millions of dollars from clients, defrauding a bank and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a bankruptcy court.
Prosecutors said Avenatti concealed $1 million he received last April, in a client settlement, from his second ex-wife and other creditors to whom he owed more than $11 million, spending some on a Mercedes-Benz.
Avenatti is awaiting trial on three federal indictments, and has pleaded not guilty on all charges.
In the Nike case, Avenatti was charged in Manhattan with threatening to publicly accuse the sportswear company of improperly paying families of college basketball recruits unless it paid him up to $25 million to conduct a probe plus $1.5 million to his client, a youth basketball coach.
U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe, who oversees the Nike case, said Avenatti's arrest caused an ""enormous disruption"" requiring an adjournment of the Jan. 21 trial, which Avenatti will be allowed to attend. Gardephe said he would be ""very reluctant"" to delay it past Jan. 27.
Jose Quinon, a lawyer for Avenatti, sought a longer delay, saying that because the new accusations involved money his client controlled, they undermined Avenatti's ability even to pay for witnesses.
""The rug has been pulled from under us because this was absolutely, totally unexpected,"" Quinon said. ""It's like going to war without weapons.""
Gardephe urged both sides to work out their differences. ""I'm asking that people be practical here, given the hand we have been dealt, which is a bad one,"" he said.
Avenatti became famous as a self-described Trump nemesis and for representing porn actress Stormy Daniels, who received hush money before the 2016 election not to reveal an alleged sexual encounter with Trump, which the president denies.
Earlier Wednesday, Gardephe refused to dismiss the Nike prosecution, which Avenatti called ""vindictive"" and payback for his animosity toward Trump.
The judge found no evidence of malice, and noted that it was Nike that alerted prosecutors to the alleged extortion.
""Avenatti is being prosecuted for activities wholly unrelated to the political arena,"" Gardephe wrote.
Before his Tuesday arrest, Avenatti faced a possible 335 years in prison in the California case.

He was also charged in Manhattan with stealing nearly $300,000 of Daniels' proceeds from her book contract.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday urged  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to move quickly to resolve issues with the grounded 737 MAX, noting the planemaker's significant impact on the U.S. economy.
Trump referenced studies that suggested the production halt of the 737 MAX could shave 0.5% from U.S. gross domestic product this year.
""Get that going. Work together,"" Trump said to Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith at a White House event to sign the Phase 1 trade deal with China. ""We've got to get that one moving fast and it's going to be better than ever, I think.""
The Trump administration said China agreed to buy $77.7 billion in manufactured goods over two years, including aircraft, but did not disclose how much would be in new planes.
Chicago-based Boeing calls itself the top U.S. exporter. It delivered more than one out of every four jetliners it made in 2018 to customers in China, where it forecasts demand for 7,700 new planes over the next 20 years, valued at $1.2 trillion.
Aviation industry sources said Boeing was expected to win a major order for wide-body jets from China, including its 787 or 777-9 models, or a mixture of both. Such a deal could ease pressure on the 787 Dreamliner, which has suffered from a broad downturn in demand for large jets, forcing Boeing to trim production late last year.
China's share in deliveries of Boeing planes fell to its lowest in seven years in 2019, Reuters analysis of Boeing sales data showed.
Boeing is halting production this month of the plane that has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. Last week, Boeing's biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR), said it plans to lay off more than 20% of its workforce in Wichita, Kansas.
Trump said he had no doubt that Boeing's new Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun would be able to turn things around.
""It's not your fault. He just got there,"" Trump said of Calhoun, a director at Boeing for the last decade who became CEO on Monday.
""You'll straighten it out quickly please?"" Trump asked Calhoun.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not expected to approve the MAX's return to service until February and perhaps not until March or later, Reuters reported. 
Boeing welcomed the trade agreement with China in a statement, and hinted at a possible order.
""We're proud that Boeing airplanes will continue to be a part of this valued relationship, one that has fueled aerospace innovation and sustained manufacturing jobs,"" Calhoun said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) flight crew that dumped fuel on several Los Angeles area schools before making an emergency landing, causing minor injuries to schoolchildren, did not inform air traffic controllers it planned to do so, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Wednesday.
Delta Flight 89, which was turned back for an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport after departing for Shanghai, dumped fuel on the playgrounds of at least four elementary schools in its flight path, causing minor injuries to at least 44 children and adults on the ground, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said on Twitter.
None of the children or adults needed hospitalization, the department added.
""A review of yesterday's air traffic control communications shows the Delta Flight 89 crew did not tell air traffic control that they needed to dump fuel,"" the FAA said. ""In this emergency situation, the fuel-dumping procedure did not occur at an optimal altitude that would have allowed the fuel to atomize properly.""
Before making emergency landings, planes often dump fuel to reduce their weight for safety reasons. The FAA said in a statement that air crews will typically notify air traffic control of an emergency and indicate the need to dump fuel, with controllers then directing the crew to an appropriate fuel-dumping area. The agency said it is continuing to investigate the circumstances behind the incident.
The Los Angeles Times obtained audio of the conversation, quoting a controller asking the Delta pilot about fuel.
""OK, so you don't need to hold to dump fuel or anything like that?"" the control asked. The pilot responded, ""Negative.""
Delta said on Tuesday it shares ""concerns regarding reported minor injuries to adults and children at a school in the area"" and said the fuel was dumped to reach a safe landing weight.
Delta declined to comment Wednesday on the FAA statement but said on its website that 13 airline cleaning crews worked with school crews ""to clean all outside surfaces that students could come into contact with."" The schools all reopened as scheduled on Wednesday."

The biggest U.S. card companies just moved a step closer to gaining access to China’s $27 trillion payments market.
China said it won’t take longer than 90 days to consider applications from providers of electronic-payments services such as Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V) and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP)., according the text of a landmark trade agreement with the U.S. It should be an especially welcome reprieve for Mastercard and its partner NetsUnion Clearing Corp., which set up a venture in March that is still awaiting approval from the People’s Bank of China to begin operations.
“China is a vital market for us,” Seth Eisen, a spokesman for Mastercard, said Wednesday in an emailed statement. “We continue to make every effort to secure the requisite license to be able to operate in China domestically. This deal is a step forward in that process.”
The move shows progress in the U.S. payment networks’ battle for access to mainland China, which has been a point of contention in the trade dispute. Officials from the world’s two largest economies finalized a bevy of deals before signing off on the first phase of a sweeping trade agreement, which they have sought to cast as a major breakthrough in relations.
Mastercard Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga and Visa CEO Al Kelly were in attendance at Wednesday’s festivities at the White House for the trade deal announcement. In a statement, Visa said it sees potential to help further develop digital payments in China through the 2022 Olympics in Beijing and that it’s approaching entry into the country “with a long-term focus.”
“Visa is working closely with the Chinese government, including the People’s Bank of China, throughout the application process for a bank card clearing institution license,” the company said in the statement, welcoming the signing of the trade agreement.
China in June 2015 allowed foreign bank-card clearing providers to obtain licenses by setting up units or acquiring a local company, ending a monopoly by state-run China UnionPay Co. But progress has since been slow for Visa and Mastercard, the world’s largest payment networks. American Express cleared a key hurdle in early January when regulators accepted its application to start a bank-card clearing business with a Chinese partner.
“We’re pleased with the progress we’re making to become the first foreign network to receive a clearing and settlement license to operate in mainland China,” Leah Gerstner, a spokeswoman for AmEx, said in a statement. “We will continue to work through the regulatory approval process through our joint venture in China.”
As part of Wednesday’s agreement, the U.S. also pledged not to discriminate against China UnionPay, or CUP, or other Chinese electronic payment services.
Mastercard and Visa have long complained that their delayed entrance into China means they’ll be pitting themselves against large domestic players in a market that’s seen mobile payments explode in recent years. Mobile transactions topped 190 trillion yuan ($27 trillion) in China in 2018, making it the world’s largest such market, according to iResearch. Ant Financial’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat Pay are the dominant mobile payments firms.
They won’t be starting from nothing. Mastercard and Visa have long worked with Chinese banks to slap their brands on cards to facilitate transactions that consumers make outside China. But Wednesday’s announcement means the networks will now have a chance to compete for those cardholders’ domestic spending as well.
China had 8.2 billion bank cards in circulation at the end of September, with 90% of them debit cards.

Investing.com – The Dow closed in record territory Wednesday, shrugging off mixed corporate earnings as investors cheered the conclusion of the phase one U.S.-China trade deal.
The S&P 500 rose 0.19%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.08% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.31%.
The U.S. and China signed the phase one trade agreement, halting their two-year trade war that had weighed on global growth. 
President Donald Trump said the ""landmark” deal would benefit American farmers. But some view the deal as fragile as it includes an option for China to quit the trade deal should the U.S. re-impose tariffs.
Under the terms of the deal, the U.S. cut tariffs on $120 billion in Chinese goods to 7.5% from 15%. China agreed to increase purchases in the U.S. by $200 billion over the next two years in manufactured goods, agriculture, energy and services. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fell 2% after warning of weaker net interest income in the first half of the year. The Wall Street bank posted results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was little changed after its earnings fell short of estimates amid a rise in legal costs concerning the 1MDB scandal.
  Target   (NYSE:TGT), meanwhile, fell 7% after its sales over the crucial holiday season missed its expectations amid softer demand for electronics and toys.
The weakness in sales was likely driven by a shorter holiday selling season,   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) suggested. The bank said Target's results ""give us no reason to change our view that TGT is a retail winner for years to come.""

With some airlines seen unlikely to take delivery of all the jets they have ordered, there has been speculation Airbus would have to trim production of the latest version of its most profitable long-range jet despite a recent flurry of new sales.
""Considering the demand I see on the A330neo I see no need to cut production levels,"" Scherer told Reuters on the sidelines of an  Air Canada  (TO:AC) event in Montreal.

Like other African telecoms firms, Telkom, in which the government holds a stake of about 40%, is trying to keep pace with a surge in demand for the internet and data with growing smart phone usage.
It is also grappling with organizational and operational inefficiencies linked to fixed voice and data services, which require more staff to install, maintain and market, it said in a letter to unions seen by Reuters.
The telecom provider said it will consider voluntary severance and early retirement packages for employees affected by phase one of the job cut, which will affect employees at Openserve and the Consumer divisions from January to April.
The affected jobs include support employees, specialist, operational employees and supervisory and management levels in its wholesale division Openserve, the consumer unit as well as in its corporate center.
The announcement comes two days after retailer Massmart Holdings (J:MSMJ), majority owned by U.S. retail giant Walmart (N:WMT), said it could cut up to 1,440 jobs under a plan to close some stores as it struggles to grow sales in a tough economy.
Telkom, which runs South Africa’s biggest fixed-line telecom network, is migrating customers to mobile voice and data as well as fiber, where it is one of the small players in a market dominated by Vodacom (J:VODJ) and MTN Group (J:MTNJ).
""The deterioration in the economic climate, increased operational, regulatory and competitive constraints, coupled with continuing rapid migration from fixed voice and data business have all had a major ongoing negative operational and financial impact on Telkom,"" it said.
""For Telkom to survive the current and anticipated tough trading conditions, it is imperative to seek and implement measures which will drastically reduce costs, eliminate inefficiencies and improve operational and financial performance in the interest of securing its continued commercial viability and employment for the majority of the employees.""
Telkom said it wants a leaner structure in its Openserve and group IT division and a focused skills set in line with the new business demands of a mobile focused business. While in consumer, the unit needs to be more market driven and customer focused."

(Reuters) - Citigroup's (N:C) female employees earn 27% less than male employees on average, when factors like title and location are not taken into account, the Wall Street bank said on Wednesday.
That was a slight improvement of two percentage points from last year, according to an internal analysis.
In similar job positions in the same location, women on average are paid 99% of what men are paid, on a par with last year's results, the bank said.
 Citigroup  began disclosing ""raw"" pay gap figures globally last year in response to shareholder pressure to disclose how much less it pays women than men.
A British law that went into effect in 2018 forced corporations to disclose unadjusted pay gap figures for their operations in that country annually, but Citi is the only bank that voluntarily discloses the global metrics.
“As we’ve said before, transparency breeds accountability and we took that important first step last year in disclosing our pay equity results,"" head of global human resources Sara Wechter said in a statement. ""We know the pressure to make progress will continue and we welcome it.”
For minorities in the United States, Citi said the median pay was 94% of the median for non-minorities, up from 93% last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China announced an initial trade deal on Wednesday that will roll back some tariffs and boost Chinese purchases of U.S. goods and services, defusing an 18-month conflict between the world's two largest economies.
Beijing and Washington have portrayed their ""Phase 1"" agreement as a momentous step after months of start-stop talks punctuated by tit-for-tat tariffs that uprooted supply chains and stoked fears of a further slowdown in the global economy.
""Together we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security for American workers, farmers and families,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said as he touted the deal in rambling, partisan remarks at the White House alongside Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and other officials.
The centerpiece of the deal is a pledge by China to purchase at least an additional $200 billion worth of U.S. farm products and other goods and services over two years, over a baseline of $186 billion in purchases in 2017.
The deal would include $50 billion in additional orders for U.S. agricultural products, Trump said, adding he was confident that U.S. farmers would be able to meet the greater demand. He also said China would buy $40 billion to $50 billion in additional U.S. services, $75 billion more in manufacturing goods, and $50 billion more worth of energy supplies. 
Officials from both countries have touted the deal as ushering in a new era for U.S.-Sino relations, but it fails to address many of the structural differences that led the Trump administration to start the trade war in the first place. 
They include Beijing's long-standing practice of propping up state-owned companies, and flooding international markets with low-priced goods. 
Trump, who has embraced an ""America First"" policy aimed at rebalancing global trade in favor of U.S. companies and workers, said China had pledged action to confront the problem of pirated or counterfeited goods, and that the deal included strong protection of intellectual property rights.
Earlier, top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox News the agreement would add 0.5 percentage point to U.S. gross domestic product growth in both 2020 and 2021.
But some analysts have expressed skepticism it will set U.S.-China trade on a new trajectory.
""I find a radical shift in Chinese spending unlikely. I have low expectations for meeting stated goals,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. ""But I do think the whole negotiation has moved the football forward for both the U.S. and China."" 
The Phase 1 deal, reached in December, canceled planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made cellphones, toys and laptop computers and halved the tariff rate to 7.5% on about $120 billion worth of other Chinese goods, including flat panel televisions, Bluetooth headphones and footwear.
But it will leave in place 25% tariffs on a vast, $250 billion array of Chinese industrial goods and components used by U.S. manufacturers.
Trump, who has been touting the Phase 1 deal as a pillar of his 2020 re-election campaign said he would agree to remove the remaining tariffs once the two sides had negotiated a ""Phase 2"" agreement. He added that those negotiations would start soon.

He also said he would visit China in the not-too-distant future.

The S&P 500 retreated as President Donald Trump presided over a signing ceremony with Chinese officials. The text of the deal has not been made public, but the Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said agricultural purchases are $40 billion a year and will be driven by demand, and will rise “if the demand” is there.
“While it does not appear that the “phase one” deal addresses many of the structural issues that started the trade spat, it does mitigate the uncertainty that ongoing trade tensions present, namely the threat of new tariffs at a moment’s notice,” said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede.
The benchmark S&P 500 had set an intraday record for the sixth consecutive trading session, largely ignoring disappointing quarterly results from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes also set highs. U.S. markets received an added boost earlier after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow promoted more tax cuts.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc., the dominant players by far in store-based and internet retailing in the U.S., will disclose their full fourth-quarter results on Jan. 30 and Feb. 18, respectively. While Amazon said Dec. 26 that it had a “record breaking” holiday season, it didn’t provide specifics.
This leaves analysts and investors with a few weeks to ponder whether the lackluster holiday sales at Target -- an industry bellwether -- tell a broader, more troubling, story about the American consumer, or if they’re just a pothole on the company’s turnaround trail.
“It’s hard to know at this point,” Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edwards Jones & Co., said by phone. “We will see what Walmart and Amazon say.”
There’s plenty of evidence that the road gets tougher from here, and not just for Target, which suffered a slowdown across the board, from t-shirts to toys to televisions. Sales of key gift categories rose just 0.2% in November and December, data tracker NPD found, well below forecasts.
Broader economic signals, meanwhile, are increasingly downbeat: U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped for the fourth time in five months in December, while wage growth remains tepid. Tariffs on Chinese imports, meanwhile, aren’t going away anytime soon.
Cautious consumers didn’t buy as many big-ticket electronics items on Black Friday, the annual shopping frenzy, and the shopping they did do increasingly came online. But e-commerce growth of 19% at Target was its worst online performance in years.
Walmart and Amazon, meanwhile, both rolled out next-day free shipping on a host of items well before the holidays, positioning themselves to grab market share in e-commerce, where battles are won as much on convenience as on prices.
The two companies control a disproportionate amount of the U.S. retail landscape. Walmart garners more than 20 cents of every dollar spent on food, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), while Amazon is the biggest seller of apparel and gobbles up more than 25% of all incremental retail spending, according to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) estimates.
The next signal comes Thursday, when the Commerce Department will release December retail sales data. But to get the full picture, investors will have to wait for the twin titans of retail weigh in."

Investing.com – Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) has enjoyed a red-hot rally of late, but its shares were dealt a blow Tuesday after analysts said most of the good news has been baked in.
Bernstein downgraded Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) to market perform from outperform on valuation worries. Shares fell 6%.
""In particular, we believe that Beyond Meat’s near-term sales growth potential in the U.S. is largely priced in at this point,"" said Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard.
The day of red does little to mask the plant-based meat company's explosive run, with shares up about about 55% for the year as investors bet that a tie-up with MacDonald's could be on the menu.
McDonald's last week said it would expand its trial of Beyond Meat's plant-based burgers in southwestern Ontario in Canada, starting Jan. 14. The 12-week trial will run at a total of 52 locations.
A McDonald's-Beyond Meat deal is forecast to add between $20 to $23 to Beyond Meat's share price – but with its shares up around $30 for the year, there is little room to advance, Oppenheimer argues.
""Applying a 7–8x sales multiple to our ~$200M BYND/MCD base case sales, a full US rollout of the P.L.T. could add $20–23/share per our math,"" said analyst Rupesh Parikh.
""Based on the recent appreciation, we believe BYND shares have now incorporated benefits related to any potential U.S. expansion with MCD,"" he added.
Beyond the U.S., however, there will likely be plenty of appetite for the company’s meatless products that promise significant growth.
""We believe that BYND has significant growth potential in Europe, which could more than double its total addressable market,"" Howard observed.
Seth Goldman, executive chairman of Beyond Meat, alluded to plans to expand abroad, saying ""we are expected to do something this year.""
""The real goal would be to take a crop from every continent where we produce and grow the crops and produce the product in that continent,"" he added."
332,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 01:16PM ET</span>",Goldman pledges 'concrete' expense target after profit decline,"By Anirban Sen and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) will set an expense target at its investor day later this month, management said on Wednesday, after the bank missed Wall Street profit expectations due to inflated costs.
A big portion of Goldman's bloated expense line came from setting aside another $1.1 billion to cover legal and regulatory costs related to the 1MDB Malaysian corruption scandal.
However, Goldman also spent more on compensation, technology, occupancy costs and professional fees, some of which pertained to new businesses, like the credit card it launched with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  and its transaction banking business.
The bank's operating expenses rose 42% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year.
Overall, the bank spent 68 cents for every dollar of revenue it produced in 2019, up from 64 cents per dollar the prior year. Investors watch that efficiency metric closely, to gauge how well a company manages costs.
Several analysts quizzed Chief Executive Officer David Solomon and Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr about costs on an earnings call, asking when the bank's investments in various businesses will start paying off. Goldman spent roughly $700 million on growth initiatives in 2019, before taxes.
Management plans to offer an expense target ""in very concrete terms"" at its investor day on Jan. 29, Scherr said.
He also said Goldman will move away from a $5-billion fresh annual revenue target it outlined in 2017, confirming a Reuters report from November. The bank will instead set measures for returns and efficiency, which better represent its goals, Scherr said.
Scherr also mentioned that of its equity investments, which are investments the bank makes with its own money, it dumped its shares of  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and reduced the amount of shares it owned in  Tradeweb Markets Inc . (O:TW).
Goldman shares rose 0.3% to $246.34 in afternoon trading.
During the fourth-quarter, Goldman's profit fell 26%, to $1.7 billion, or $4.69 per share, from $2.3 billion, or $6.04 per share in the same period of 2018.
Analysts had expected a profit of $5.47 per share, on average, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv. Some said the bank beat estimates by a stretch when excluding legal and regulatory provisions.
All but one of Goldman's four new business units reported better quarterly results.
Global markets, which houses the trading business, reported $3.5 billion in revenue, up 33%, thanks to easy comparisons with the year-ago period. The strong trading performance mirrored trends at major rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC).
The only sore spot for Goldman during the quarter was investment banking, where revenue fell 6% to $2.1 billion, hurt by lower M&A advisory fees, as well as a slowdown in corporate lending.
Goldman changed its reporting lines this month in response to long-standing requests for more transparency from analysts and investors. 
The new structure offers more insight into consumer banking, a pillar of Solomon's strategy to offset sharp declines in trading revenue over the past decade or so.
That business is a tiny but fast-growing part of Goldman Sachs. It represented just 2.4% of the bank's revenue in 2019, at $864 million, which was up 41% from the prior year.
Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr characterized the results as encouraging, because of Goldman's revenue growth, its progress in building out new businesses and signs that it is getting closer to resolving 1MDB matters.
The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up the 1MDB fund in 2009, and the U.S. Justice Department estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014. Goldman has been investigated by regulators in at least 14 countries for its underwriting role.
Solomon said the bank is actively engaged with authorities to settle as quickly as possible, though he cautioned that there is no guarantee of a settlement or when one might occur.
Schorr said it could take time before the bank is generating significantly better returns for investors.

""Markets won’t always be this strong and the new builds will take years to achieve scale and materially contribute,"" he wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.

333,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 01:16PM ET</span>",U.S. and China Sign Phase One of Trade Deal,"(Bloomberg) - The U.S. and China signed what they’re billing as the first phase of a broader trade pact on Wednesday amid persistent questions over whether President Donald Trump’s efforts to rewrite the economic relationship with Beijing will ever go any further.
The deal commits China to do more to crack down on the theft of American technology and corporate secrets by its companies and state entities, while outlining a $200 billion spending spree to try to close its trade imbalance with the U.S. It also binds Beijing to avoiding currency manipulation to gain an advantage and includes an enforcement system to ensure promises are kept.
The ceremony at the White House, which included Trump, dozens of American business people and Chinese officials, was a rare moment of friendship lately between the world’s two largest economies. Acrimonious talks stretching back almost three years have roiled financial markets, cast a cloud of uncertainty over investment decisions and hurt growth in both nations.
“This is a very important and remarkable occasion,” Trump said at the signing. “Together we are righting the wrongs of the past.”
The benchmark S&P 500 Index set an intraday record high for the sixth consecutive trading session.
The deal, sealed on the same day the House prepared to refer articles of Trump’s impeachment to the Senate, has already been criticized for what is missing. It does nothing to address areas like what U.S. authorities have long claimed is China’s state-backed hacking of American companies and government institutions. Nor does it require the Asian nation to reform the vast web of state subsidies that form the spine of its model of state capitalism and have helped fuel the rapid growth of Chinese companies compete internationally.
The administration says many of those issues will be covered in a second phase of a deal, though when those talks will begin and how long they will take remains uncertain. In the meantime, the U.S. is also set to maintain tariffs on roughly two-thirds of imports from China.
“As soon as this kicks in we’re starting phase two,” Trump said. “I will agree to take those tariffs off if we’re able to do phase two, otherwise we don’t have any cards to negotiate with. They will all come off as soon as we finish phase two.”
At the ceremony, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He read a letter from President Xi Jinping, stating the two sides have to implement the agreement “in real earnest.”
“I hope the U.S. side will treat fairly Chinese companies,” he said through an interpreter. In his own comments, Liu said China will “strictly honor” the pact.
Trump’s top negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, told reporters ahead of the signing that the administration was focused on implementing the initial agreement in the short term. Any further negotiations will only come after that, he said.
Officials also insist that they are harvesting significant commitments from Beijing that mean the phase one agreement will benefit U.S. businesses and workers even if discussions never go any further.
The deal requires China to do more to stop the sale of pirated goods and to apply criminal penalties on anyone caught steeling commercial secrets. It also requires Beijing to deliver an action plan withing 30 days of the deal taking effect on how it intends to meet its commitments.
It also requires China to stop pressuring American companies investing in the country to share technology with local joint-venture partners. The agreement stipulates that the Chinese must stop supporting or directing the acquisition of overseas investment aimed at buying up technologies.
“This is an enormous win,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters ahead of the signing, pointing to Chinese commitments on IP that will affect the technology sector as well as other reforms on currency, the opening up of the financial services sector to U.S. companies and the promised spending spree.
Other supporters of Trump’s trade policies insist that the initial deal goes a long way toward addressing the IP issues that were at the core of the case brought against China. “Anyone complaining that this doesn’t resolve every U.S.-China issue needs to recall that this entire negotiation was based on a report on China’s IP and techtransfer policies,” said Clete Willems, who until last year was a member of Trump’s national economic council and is now at law firm Akin Gump.
China has already moved to address some U.S. complaints on IP. Over the past year, it has made a rapid-fire series of legal changes amid the negotiations to beef up protection. A new foreign investment law that took effect on Jan. 1 bans administrative agencies from forcing companies to transfer technological knowhow as a cost of entry to the Chinese market. It also exposes officials who disclose or leak trade secrets gleaned from regulatory approvals to potential criminal penalties.
The U.S. is also moving to address remaining issues like industrial subsidies in other ways. On Tuesday the U.S., European Union, and Japan said they had agreed on the content of new stricter global rules on subsidies aimed largely at China and would be mounting a joint push to build support for them internationally.
The Trump administration says what separates its deal most from others is the enforcement mechanism it establishes. Rather than rely on a slow-moving World Trade Organization dispute system that Trump in any case has already hobbled by blocking the appointment of top judges, the new agreement with China would allow the administration to move to punish Beijing with tariffs or other measures within 90 days if officials decided it was breaking its promises.
But even Lighthizer acknowledges how effective that mechanism will be depends on Beijing. “This deal will work if China wants it to work,” he said Wednesday.
The deal is also unique in the breadth of specific Chinese purchase commitments it contains, which some critics in the U.S. see as uncomfortably reminiscent of the sort of state-directed central planning American diplomats have spent decades trying to get China to abandon. Even those purchase promises, the details of which are contained in a secret annex to the agreement signed on Tuesday, face questions.
The text of the deal released Wednesday specifies $77.7 billion in Chinese purchases of manufactured goods including aircraft, $32 billion in agricultural products, $52.4 billion in energy and $37.9 billion in services in the two years through December 2021.
Much of the attention has focused on whether U.S. farm exports to China can reach the $40 billion to $50 billion annual level that Trump has promised, which would mean doubling the $24 billion in agriculture and related products it imported from the U.S. in 2017, before the trade war began.
There are also questions over a Chinese commitment to buy an additional $50 billion in U.S. oil and gas over two years and pledges to step up purchases of cars, planes and other manufactured goods.
To meet the energy target, China would have to import roughly one-third of the 3 million barrels a day of crude that the U.S. exported last year over a two year period, according to Bloomberg calculations. Which is why analysts believe meeting that deal may depend heavily on buying natural gas, which is usually traded via long-term contracts rather than spot purchases.
However, China may not have much appetite for any additional gas right now beyond the long-term contracts it has already committed to as it continues to struggle with a slowing economy and a slowdown in demand growth and already-brimming stockpiles. Likewise, U.S. LNG export plants have most of their volumes tied up in their own long-term contracts and would only be able to provide China with a marginal amount of spot supply over the next two years."

335,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 01:04PM ET</span>",Microsoft’s President Says U.S.-China Divisions Risk Tech ‘Cold War’,"(Bloomberg) --  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). gets just 1.8% of its global sales from China, even though the country accounts for about 18% of the world’s population, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said, noting that tensions between the two largest economies risk creating a technology “cold war.”
“The Chinese market is not and has never been fully open to U.S. companies,” Smith said Wednesday at the U.S. China Series conference in Seattle. That’s not the only reason American companies have failed to deliver success in China, he said -- U.S. firms also haven’t recognized the differing tastes and needs of Chinese customers.
An increase in restrictions on what can be seen online in China, the so-called Great Firewall of China, also means that there isn’t a single global internet, and if there ever was, it ended five to eight years ago, Smith said. Tensions with China are bipartisan and won’t be changed by the next U.S. presidential election, leading to questions as to whether the two countries are heading to a technology cold war, he said.
Smith related a recent conversation with a former senior administration official, whom he didn’t name. The Microsoft executive said he asked about the likelihood of a tech cold war. “‘I think we’re already in one,’” Smith said the former official replied."

340,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 12:28PM ET</span>","Even at Goldman Sachs, $1 Billion Leaves a Mark","(Bloomberg Opinion) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s fourth-quarter earnings were always going to be somewhat messy after the bank announced last week that it would shake up the way it breaks down results by division. The move makes sense for the long term, but more immediately it raises doubts about the accuracy of line-by-line comparisons from a year ago.
To further complicate matters, Goldman on Wednesday disclosed a $1.09 billion legal charge, up from $516 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, as it closes in on a settlement of the so-called 1MDB scandal. That was a chief reason overall expenses reached $7.3 billion, easily exceeding analysts’ $5.422 billion estimate in a Bloomberg survey. That carried over to the headline numbers, which can’t be disguised or attributed to the new reporting structure: Profit dropped 24%, and earnings per share of $4.69 missed analysts’ estimates for $5.52. It was the first back-to-back EPS misses since mid-2011.
Clearly, not even a Wall Street powerhouse can easily offset such a huge buildup in litigation reserves. But that’s not to say it didn’t try.
Aside from the legal charge, Goldman largely followed the trend of its earlier-reporting competitors. Fixed-income trading revenue beat expectations by soaring by 63% from a year earlier, an increase that topped Citigroup Inc.’s 49% but fell short of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s 86%. It remained at the top of the rankings for global mergers and acquisitions and equity offerings. The consumer and wealth management division beat analysts’ revenue estimates. Investment banking revenue wasn’t spectacular, but it wasn’t all that much better at the other big U.S. banks.
The temptation, then, is to simply look past Goldman’s role in raising money for state-owned investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd and the scrutiny the bank has come under for making some $600 million on the deals. Indeed, some analysts have done just that already. After adjusting for litigation and the 21% effective tax rate that Goldman sees for 2020, core EPS actually came in at $6.49, ahead of an estimate of $5.94, Wolfe Research’s Steven Chubak wrote. “We believe front-loading of investments and higher litigation accrual positions the firm well to drive improved efficiency/returns in 2020 and beyond.”
Along a similar line of thought: “If people feel like they have a handle on what 1MDB will cost Goldman, they will say: ‘Now I know what this is, and the other parts of the business are doing well,’” Sarah Hunt, a portfolio manager at Alpine Woods Capital Investors, said on Bloomberg TV.
It’s understandable why investors and analysts make this argument, even if it feels a little crass. Sure, Goldman was caught up in a global scandal involving embezzlement and money laundering, the thinking goes, but at least there’s a more definitive price tag now.
To be fair, Goldman Chief Executive Officer David Solomon has apologized to the people of Malaysia for the bank’s role in the fraud. And he reiterated in a conference call on Wednesday that the company has been “self-critical” in recent years and that “this is not representative of our longstanding values.”
But that doesn’t mean the company and its shareholders aren’t ready to get the bill and move on, given that this has been looming over the bank since at least 2016. “We are working hard to bring closure,” Solomon said.
Goldman’s revamped reporting structure only further demonstrates its longer-term focus. As Bloomberg News’s Sridhar Natarajan reported, the changes came in response to calls for more clarity from the bank. It did away with its so-called investing and lending reporting line, which was often its most profitable during periods of strong market performance. It will spread interest income across all four of the new segments and create more apples-to-apples comparisons to competitors. It breaks out asset management and consumer banking, two growth areas that diversify the bank away from its usual make-or-break trading and investment banking businesses.
I’ve written before about how Solomon sees the bank “on an evolutionary path” and why it’s going to be a long road ahead. The consumer bank, for instance, brought in $228 million in final three months of 2019. That’s up 23% from the prior year but just a 5% increase from the third quarter. In asset management, net revenue was little changed last year relative to 2018 as an increase in average assets under supervision was offset by lower average fees. Both are on the right track, of course, but the growth is hardly exciting when compared with blockbuster fixed-income trading figures.
Add it all up and Goldman seems committed to playing the long game. It now has the Apple Card fully up and running and has its consumer bank, Marcus, offering a suite of savings options. It has the new reporting structure. And it will hold its first-ever investor day on Jan. 29, which Bloomberg News’s Jenny Surane noted is something of a watershed moment for a company that has been publicly traded for more than two decades. Solomon said the bank would give its financial targets and goals at the investor presentation.
This vision most likely makes the continuing 1MDB saga all the more frustrating for Goldman’s leadership. Until the bank reaches some sort of settlement, it’s bound to be an albatross each quarterly earnings season."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fund investors began the new year by pulling $13.1 billion out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. stocks over the first full week of 2020, the largest pullback from the domestic stock market since September, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute.
At the same time, investors sent approximately $24.7 billion into funds that hold taxable or municipal debt, the largest single-week inflow into bonds since 2013.
The retreat from the U.S. stock market comes as the benchmark S&P 500 index continues to post record highs after jumping nearly 30% over the course of 2019 thanks to a partial trade deal with China and expectations that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates any time soon. The S&P 500 index is up nearly 2% since the start of the year, more than double comparable indices in developed markets such as Europe and Japan.
Yet some strategists and investors are cautioning that the U.S. stock market is becoming over-valued.
""Signs of overbought conditions are growing, along with exuberant sentiment,"" said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler.
Fund investors remained slightly bullish on foreign stocks by sending $260 million in net inflows into world stock funds, the smallest gain over the last four weeks."

""China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and Beijing's penchant for weaponizing trade is enough to cause heightened concern that China's rise may not be as peaceful as it is purported to be.""
That said, on one of the most important current issues, the future of 5G networks, Huawei and other Chinese telecoms companies were considered better bets than their U.S. rivals, despite U.S. accusations that Huawei equipment could be used for spying.
Almost 80% of respondents - mainly from public office, academia and think-tanks - picked China as the most influential economic power, up from 73% in 2019. Some 52% said it was the most important political and strategic power, up from 45%.
The large majority of those that picked China in both surveys said they were worried about this growing influence.
Respondents from Vietnam and the Philippines - who have long sparred with Beijing over claims in the South China Sea - were the most distrusting of China.
Accusations of China's mistreatment of Muslims in Xinjiang, its handling of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and its use of economic muscle were also flagged as concerns in the report.
The number of respondents that picked the United States as the foremost political power in the region retreated to 27% from 31%. On the economic front, it held steady at 8% from 2019, the first year the survey was carried out.
Over three quarters of respondents said U.S. engagement with Southeast Asia had decreased under Trump compared with his predecessor, Barack Obama.
When it came to the deployment of 5G mobile networks, Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) was preferred by nearly 40% of respondents. But Huawei and other Chinese companies were seen as preferable to European or U.S. suppliers.
Chinese companies came top in Laos, Cambodia and Malaysia."

Labor Minister Hubertus Heil plans to introduce wage subsidies for car producers and their suppliers to prevent possible job losses if the downturn in the sector continues, his ministry said in response to questions from Bloomberg News. A similar mechanism was used successfully during the financial crisis of 2008 to prevent mass layoffs.
The government is hosting talks with labor union and company representatives on Wednesday to discuss the plans, which would still require parliamentary approval. The meeting is not expected to produce a final decision, as the government itself can’t agree on the timing. While the Social Democrat Heil is pushing for a swift implementation, Merkel’s ruling Christian Democratic party wants the Bundestag, the lower house in parliament, to have the final say on a time line.
Carmakers in Europe’s largest economy had a turbulent 2019 as an economic slowdown coincided with a transition to electric and self-driving cars. Additionally, concerns about higher tariffs caused by the U.S.-China trade war stoked fears of a deteriorating environment for the industry. PSA Group’s German car-making division Opel said on Tuesday that it will cut up to 4,100 jobs, joining rivals around the globe in retrenching amid a sales slowdown and technological disruption.
“The car sector is undergoing a difficult transition phase and needs more flexibility to respond to a slowdown,” SPD deputy leader in the Bundestag, Carsten Schneider, told reporters Wednesday in Berlin.
Wage subsidies allow companies to keep employees on their payroll during a downturn, but under current legislation are only allowed if the labor market as a whole is in trouble. Heil wants to introduce subsidies for specific sectors in trouble, such as the car industry.
Under his proposal the government would pay social security contributions if a worker cuts back their working hours to take on vocational training.
For January, the labor ministry expects 113,500 workers on a reduced workload program. During the financial crisis, the number peaked at 1.4 million in 2009.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge funds that push for change at corporations stepped up their demands for asset spin-offs and sales last year, making them part of nearly half of all activist investor campaigns waged in 2019, according to data released on Wednesday.
""A record 99 campaigns with an M&A-related thesis were launched in 2019,"" said Jim Rossman, the head of shareholder advisory at Lazard, which compiled the statistics. Calls for companies to be sold outright or for certain units to be divested accounted for 47% of last year's activity, up from 35% in previous years, Rossman said.
Some of the most noteworthy mergers and acquisition plays from last year include Carl Icahn pushing for Hewlett Packard to accept a takeover offer from Xerox (NYSE:XRX). Icahn owns shares in both companies.
Icahn also pushed for a strategic review at Caesars which was later purchased by Eldorado Resorts.
At AT&T, Elliott Management urged the company to consider selling off certain parts of its business. Elliott also called on Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) to break itself apart before the company spun off its Speedway unit.
The surge came as activist funds delivered their best returns in years, posting an average 18.3% return in 2019, Hedge Fund Research data show.
Activism has picked up dramatically since the 2008 financial crisis. But it was popular long before, including in the period form the 1970s to late 1980s when financiers including Carl Icahn and Nelson Peltz were called corporate raiders for strong-arm tactics used to replace top management and improve value for shareholders.
Activists also shifted their focus abroad with more non-U.S. companies being targeted, according to Lazard statistics.
Last year non-U.S. targets made up 40% of all campaigns, up from 30% in 2015. Among other destinations, they waged 19 campaigns in Japan, with Third Point returning for a second push for changes at Sony."

Investing.com - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) sold out of Uber (NYSE:UBER) completely in the fourth quarter for what was likely a large gain, according to a published report Wednesday.
Goldman shed its complete stake, although it was unclear what had prompted the company to cash in on its investment in the ride-share giant, CNBC reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.
The sales would’ve booked a large quarterly gain in revenue for its fourth-quarter top line, CNBC said.

The company reported earnings per share of $4.69 on revenue of $9.96 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $5.56 on revenue of $8.53 billion. 
Revenue from its fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading rose 63% from a low base in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $1.77 billion.
Goldman owned about 10 million shares of Uber (NYSE:UBER) as of the fourth quarter, according to Bloomberg. Based on Uber’s share price, Goldman could have taken in anywhere from about $290 million to $340 million from the sale."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by strong flows into its exchange-traded fund business that boosted overall assets under management to a record $7.43 trillion.
A rally in global equity markets and strong inflows across business segments helped the company lure $128.84 billion in new money during the fourth quarter through Dec. 31.
""I think it's quite evident from our flows in the fourth quarter that we are winning more of our clients' share of wallet,"" Chief Executive Larry Fink said in an interview with Reuters.
Even as the stock market enjoyed a sharp rally recently, many of BlackRock's clients were under-invested in equities and remained heavily oriented towards fixed-income securities, Fink said.
However, fears of a global slowdown have moderated through 2019 and investors have started to take on risk, he added. 
BlackRock's iShares-branded ETFs took in $75.20 billion of new money, up from $41.50 billion in the prior quarter, taking the net inflow for the year to $183 billion.
Those flows helped lift total assets to $7.43 trillion.
""A lot of times, if a company is big, the law of big numbers makes it hard to grow, we are not seeing that with BlackRock,"" said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones.
""The size is actually allowing them to continue to be more aggressive and push into new products and take market share,"" said Sanders, who maintained a 'buy' rating on the company.
With its growing heft, BlackRock has drawn increased scrutiny of its fossil fuel investments. On Tuesday, Fink warned company boards to step up efforts to tackle climate change, a significant shift by the world's top asset manager.
In his annual letter to CEOs posted on the company's website on Tuesday, Fink forecast a ""fundamental reshaping of finance"" and said companies must act or face anger from investors over how unsustainable business practices might curb their future wealth.
The New York-based company's fourth-quarter net income https://ir.blackrock.com/files/doc_financials/2019/Q4/BLK-4Q19-Earnings-Release.pdf surged to $1.30 billion, or $8.29 per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $927 million, or $5.78 per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding items, BlackRock earned $8.34 per share, while analysts had expected $7.69, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""We had high expectations this quarter, just given the good market backdrop, and they still exceeded what the Street was looking for,"" said Sanders.
A thawing in U.S.-China trade tensions during the fourth quarter supported global equity markets, especially U.S. stocks. The benchmark S&P 500 index climbed 8.5% during the period, taking the year's surge to 29%. 
For the fourth quarter, BlackRock's cash management business drew net inflows of $29.80 billion, taking total assets for the business to $545.95 billion. 

BlackRock shares were up 2.1% in morning trading.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) got stung by lower interest rates in the fourth quarter, sending its profit down 4%, a trend that management expects to continue this year.
The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender is especially vulnerable to rate movements because of the composition of its balance sheet. As the Federal Reserve cut rates three times last year, analysts predicted Bank of America's earnings would suffer.
The bank blunted the impact last quarter by growing loans at a rapid clip, and managed to beat Wall Street's quarterly forecasts. But Bank of America shares fell 2% in morning trading after Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said net interest income will decline through the first six months of 2020.
Donofrio expects to improve that metric later in the year by growing loans and reducing interest rates on deposits, but predicted Bank of America's net interest income will be ""modestly"" lower for the full year.
Analysts gave Bank of America credit for the way it has handled lower rates, with Wolfe Research's Steven Chubak calling its performance ""impressive"" and Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski saying interest income ""held up very well.""
""The rate environment definitely has an impact, but it isn't insurmountable,"" he said in a note to clients.
The bank's results were also helped by bond trading, whose revenue rose 25% to $1.8 billion.
The bond trading business performed well across Wall Street, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) reporting even bigger revenue jumps. The increase was largely due to easy comparisons with the year-ago quarter.
Trading is a small part of Bank of America's income statement compared with consumer banking, its biggest business. Revenue there fell 5% to $9.5 billion, largely due to lower rates.
The bank's net interest margin, which measures how profitably a bank can lend out depositors' funds, fell to 2.35% from 2.52% a year earlier, and from 2.41% in the prior quarter.
Still, Bank of America managed to grow loans 6%, far outpacing increases at Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Its deposits grew 5%.
Overall, the bank's profit fell to $6.75 billion from $7.04 billion a year earlier. Excluding special items, the bank earned 75 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 68 cents, according to Refinitiv.
Revenue fell slightly to $22.35 billion."

Reuters reported last week that the Netherlands had withheld the license ASML needs to export its newest machines to China following pressure from the U.S. government..
ASML, one of the Netherlands' largest companies, is a near monopolist in lithography, an essential step in the manufacture of computer chips. China has invested billions to develop its burgeoning semiconductor industry, but needs ASML equipment if its chipmakers are to compete with the best in Taiwan, South Korea and the United States.
""We are concerned that the Netherlands is politicizing our trade relationship under American pressure,"" Chinese ambassador Xu Hong was quoted as saying in the Het Financieele Dagblad newspaper.
""If this movement continues it will of course negatively affect bilateral relations.""
After a lengthy trade war, the United States and China are expected to announce a limited trade deal on Wednesday that will not resolve disputes over technology transfers.
A spokeswoman for the Chinese embassy confirmed Xu had been interviewed by the newspaper, and said the embassy would publish a complete transcript later on Wednesday.
In the interview, Xu noted that China was an important export market for the Netherlands.
In 2018, the Netherlands also imported 39.2 billion euros ($43.7 billion) worth of Chinese goods, two-thirds of which was exported on to other countries.
ASML, which is due to report full-year earnings next week, has said it can't ship its newest machines without a license, as they are considered ""dual use"" goods with potential military applications. It says an export request is under consideration.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters on Friday the government treated dual use export requests on a case by case basis and he would not comment on individual cases.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Irene Gerritsen said on Wednesday the government did not have any new response in light of Xu's remarks.
""When deciding whether to issue an export license, the Dutch government weighs both the economic and security interests,"" she said in an emailed statement."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is planning a new law to safeguard foreign investment by speeding up dispute resolution, aiming to attract more capital from overseas to boost stuttering domestic growth, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
In a 40-page initial draft, India's finance ministry has proposed appointing a mediator and setting up fast-track courts to settle disputes between investors and the government, one of the sources said.
""The idea is to attract and promote foreign investment, but a major issue for investors is enforcement of contracts and speedy dispute resolution,"" said the official.
The draft proposal is aimed at diffusing investor mistrust around the sanctity of agreements, which has worsened recently after some state governments decided to review approved projects, or threatened to cancel contracts.
Both officials declined to be named as the proposal is not public, and is still being assessed by different ministries and regulators. 
A spokesman for the finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Foreign investors have highlighted the enforcement of contracts as one of their biggest concerns, said the second official, adding that improving on this front would also reduce litigation for the government.
While investors can still rely on the existing legal system to settle disputes, it often takes several years for cases to be decided or settled. 
Investors previously had an option to take India to international arbitration courts under bilateral investment treaties (BITs) the government had agreed with dozens of nations. But, after suffering setbacks in overseas arbitration matters, India has allowed most of its treaties to lapse, giving investors little to fall back on in case of major disputes. 
BITs are agreements between two countries that give foreign investors protections, and among other things, legal recourse via international arbitration in disputes with a government.
India is entangled in more than 20 such overseas arbitration cases - the most against any country - brought by companies including  Vodafone  (L:VOD), Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) for disputes over retrospective tax claims and breach of contracts. 
If India loses these cases, brought before most of its BITs lapsed, it could end up paying billions of dollars in damages.
The government's thinking is that India may not need to sign investment treaties with other nations if the new law, which is modeled on a BIT, can give confidence to investors, said the first source. 
A domestic law, however, cannot be a substitute for a BIT as its scope cannot allow investors to take their case to international arbitration, the sources said.
CONTRACT WRANGLES 
Though India's overall ranking in the World Bank's ease of doing business report has improved to 63 from 142 in 2014, it still ranks poorly - 163 out of 190 - when it comes to enforcement of contracts.
The latest example of a contract wrangle is a dispute between the Andhra Pradesh state government in southern India and renewable energy companies. The state has been curtailing power procurement from the companies, citing high prices, and has pushed to renegotiate its supply contracts with them. 
Investors including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984), Singapore's GIC Holdings, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and France's Engie (PA:ENGIE) have invested in renewable projects in the state.
The draft proposal for the new law includes a plan to set up an investment tribunal in state high courts that will take up cases as a matter of priority, or will see if the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which also handles insolvency and corporate matters, can handle it.
""We are yet to evaluate what the risks of bringing such a law are and if it would do more harm than good,"" said the second source, adding that discussions were at an early stage.
The finance ministry has held several meetings with other ministries to discuss the draft law, said the official.
The most recent meeting in December was attended by officials from the ministries of commerce, external affairs and law, as well as the banking and stock market regulators, all of whom have been asked to submit their comments, said the first source.
It was not immediately clear when the deadline to submit comments is, or when the next meeting will be held. The ministries and regulators did not respond to requests for comment.
Pratibha Jain, a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates who advises foreign investors, welcomed the government plans.

""The idea is good and the government should consider broadening the scope to private disputes between foreign investors and domestic companies, as well as arbitrary rule changes by regulators, central bank decisions, and white collar crime cases that impact overseas investment,"" she added.

LONDON (Reuters) - New European Union cross-border share trading platforms set up by the London Stock Exchange and rival Aquis ahead of Brexit have been mothballed due to limited demand.
The LSE said there are no plans for the new Amsterdam offshoot of its Turquoise pan-European platform to start up next month, while Aquis, which set up a hub in Paris, said trading in euro shares would continue in London for now.
""To do anything else at this point would unnecessarily fragment liquidity and, not surprisingly, there has been no member push for this,"" an Aquis official said.
The LSE, Aquis and Cboe Europe, the region's biggest cross-border share trading platform, created EU hubs in case their London operations get cut off from customers in the bloc after Brexit, which is now due to take place on January 31.
Brexit raised the spectre of London being sidelined in trading euro-denominated shares after transactions in euro-denominated fixed income moved to the bloc in March 2019.
But Britain will now leave the EU with a settlement that includes a transition period to December, meaning continued unfettered access for London-based financial firms.
Cboe Europe has already started up its new Amsterdam hub and although volumes remain negligible, its president David Howson said it will remain open despite the transition period.
Volume in euro shares could start moving from its London unit to the Netherlands if uncertainty over Britain's direct access to EU investors after transition grows.
""As things evolve throughout the year, we will get clarity on equivalence (EU market access)... Depending on what that time horizon looks like, we will look to differentiate and induce volumes to potentially go there,"" Howson said.
Amsterdam will be a base for building up the U.S. exchange operator's plans to expand into areas like derivatives trading and clearing in Europe, Howson said. Cboe is buying a pan-European stocks clearing house headquartered in the Netherlands.
POLITICAL HURDLES
Britain and the EU aim to complete assessments on so-called equivalence-based market access for firms like trading platforms and clearing houses by June.
Steven Maijoor, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), said last week that assessments can be done by the summer, but a decision on access would hinge on wider trade negotiations between Brussels and London.
ESMA had said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, EU investors would have to use EU-based platforms for trading euro denominated shares and derivatives.
There are also other potential hurdles to UK access.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he does not want Britain to align itself to EU rules after Brexit, which could make access for financial firms hard to maintain.
The EU is also keen to build up its own capital market to cut reliance on London and could insist that EU investors trade euro-denominated shares on platforms inside the bloc.
Faced with pressure from EU policymakers, CME and the LSE moved trading in euro-denominated fixed income from London, while UK-based derivatives platforms are also waiting to see how much access they will get to the EU after transition.
""We would like to see a great deal more clarity in the area of... derivatives trading obligation,"" said Roger Cogan, head of European public policy at global derivatives industry body ISDA.
If trading moves, clearing could follow over time, industry officials say, further harming London. So far this has not been the case in swaps, where the LSE dominates clearing for now, although it has shifted clearing in euro repurchase agreements from London to its Paris arm."

8:58 AM ET: Beyond Meat's (NASDAQ:BYND) hot streak has come to an abrupt end. The stock was down 5.8% on profit-taking after a rally that pushed it 50% higher since the start of the year. Bernstein analysts led by Alexia Howard earlier downgraded the stock to market perform, noting likely capacity constraints in the coming year.
8:50 AM ET: UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) stock rose 0.7% after the U.S.’s largest health insurer reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results. The surprise was due largely to its Optum unit, which includes its pharmacy benefits management business. UnitedHealth also reaffirmed its full-year outlook for 2020 at around $16.40 a share.
8:28 AM ET: BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) stock was up 0.8% after reporting record net inflows for 2019 thanks to the sustained boom in passive investing. Its iShares-branded ETFs took in $75.20 billion of new money, up from $41.50 billion in the prior quarter. Fourth-quarter earnings were some 8% ahead of consensus.
  Target   (NYSE:TGT) stock was down 7.0% after the big-box retailer said holiday sales had risen only 1.4% on the year, well below last year’s 5.7% increase and also below its own expectations. The company had a particularly hard time in electronics and toys, although beauty and apparel fared better.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock was down 0.6% after missing consensus forecasts for earnings due to a steep rise in provisions against credit losses. Litigation-related impairments of over $1 billion – chiefly arising from the Malaysian 1MDB scandal, also weighed on full-year numbers. That overshadowed a strong end to the year by the bank’s currency and bond traders.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock was down 0.3% after the bank reported a modest drop in revenue and net profit in the fourth quarter. The decline in earnings was less than expected but its core lending figures failed to impress as much as JPMorgan’s and Citi’s on Tuesday."

""I think a very significant amount of the technology issues are in Phase 1. There are other certain areas of services away from financial services that will be in Phase 2. There are certain additional cybersecurity issues that will be in Phase 2,"" Mnuchin told CNBC as the two countries were poised to sign the first phase of the agreement.
""There still more issues to deal with and we'll address those.""
President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are due to sign the pact at a ceremony at the White House at 11:30 a.m. EST, marking a truce after 18 months of tit-for-tat tariffs that have weighed on global economic growth.

The industry bellwether's strategy of improved merchandise, loyalty program, store layout, which resulted in three strong quarters this year and a record-breaking 2018 holiday period, fell short during the shorter-than-usual holiday season.
Comparable sales growth a year ago was 5.7%.
""While we knew this season was going be challenging, it was even more challenging than we expected,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said.
""A tough miss considering how hard our team worked all season long.""
The numbers come just a week after several U.S. retailers including Kohl's (N:KSS), J.C. Penney (N:JCP) and Macy's (N:M) reported lower sales for the key shopping period, raising doubts about the broader health of the retail sector. 
Target's shares, which nearly doubled in 2019, fell 8% before the bell, while shares of the world's biggest retailer, Walmart Inc (N:WMT), slipped 2%. 
Target said lower sales in categories such as toys, electronics and home products, which typically account for a higher portion of sales during the holidays, had a greater impact on overall sales growth. 
Still, apparel, beauty, food and beverage were some of the bright spots, the company said. 
Digital sales during the November-December period grew 19% compared with 2018's 29% rise. 
The company now expects its fourth-quarter same-store sales to be in line with its holiday period growth of 1.4%, down from its prior range of a 3% to 4% growth. It maintained its forecast for full-year profit.

Analysts have projected quarterly comparable sales growth of 3.8%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investing.com - Wall Street is expected to open marginally lower Wednesday, continuing Tuesday’s late pullback with investors fretting that trade tensions between the U.S. and China with continue long after the deal set to be signed later.
 S&P 500 Futures were trading 2 points, or 0.2%, lower by 7:10 AM ET (12:10 GMT), Nasdaq 100 Futures were 1 point, or 0.1%, lower, while the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was down 24 points, or 0.1%.
That said, losses are likely to be minor. The overall tone remains very positive, with stock market gains in January in line to be the most in seven years. Wall Street hasn’t had a pullback over 1% for 66 trading days.
U.S. and Chinese officials are set to sign the “phase one” trade deal Wednesday in Washington, scheduled at 11:30 AM ET (16:30 GMT). It had been hoped that this would indicate a scaling back of trade hostilities between the two economic powerhouses, but overnight comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have put paid to that.
""The tariffs will stay in place until there is a phase two. If the president gets phase two quickly, he will consider releasing tariffs. If not, there won't be any tariff relief,"" Mnuchin said on Bloomberg TV.
Aside from the trade agreement, eyes will also be on the release of earnings from the likes of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) for the final three months of last year before the stock market open. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) offered up a small beat on expectations, with revenues coming in at $22.49 billion, versus $22.35 billion expected and EPS at $0.74 versus $0.68. However, both revenue and net income were down on the year, in part due to the Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts in the second half of last year. At 07:05 AM ET (12:05 GMT) Bank of America’s shares traded 0.7% higher premarket.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) had by comparison reported big increases in earnings on Tuesday. 
Elsewhere,   Target   (NYSE:TGT) stock fell as much as 9% before paring losses after the retailer said holiday sales had missed its expectations, rising only 1.4% on the year.
Economic data on the slate Wednesday includes the PPI release for December, the NY Empire State Manufacturing Index for January and the weekly {{0|oil} inventories.
Crude oil traded up 0.2% at $58.32 a barrel. International Brent oil futures also rose, this time 0.1% to $64.55. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX rose 0.5% to $1,551.65."

Investing.com - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) logged a rare miss on earnings in the fourth quarter on Wednesday, due to a steep rise in provisions against possible credit losses, although the blow was softened by a blowout quarter for the bank's bond and currency traders.
 

The firm reported earnings per share of $4.69 on revenue of $9.96 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $5.56 on revenue of $8.53 billion.

Return on tangible equity, a key measure of profitability, slipped to an annualized 9.2% in the quarter, the bank said. For the year as a whole, ROTE fell to 10.6%. It would have been 12.2% had it not been for litigation provisions of $1.24 billion, chiefly in regard of the Malaysian 1MDB development bank scandal.

On Tuesday, JPMorgan reported fourth quarter EPS of $2.57 on revenue of $29.21B, compared to forecasts of EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $27.87B.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 07:26AM ET</span>",Bailed-out Monte dei Paschi taps bond market with 400 million euro issue,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian bank Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS) launched a 400 million euro ($446 million) bond issue on Wednesday, fulfilling commitments under its bailout agreement and coming after Moody's acknowledged the lender's progress on restructuring.
The state-owned bank follows other Italian lenders that have rushed to issue riskier, and relatively costlier, debt this month, taking advantage as investors start to eat into their new year budgets.
Monte dei Paschi's Tier2 bond, a type of subordinated debt that ranks below senior debt in the repayment order, comes after Moody's last week lifted its outlook on the bank's debt to ""positive"".
Monte dei Paschi, for years at the forefront of Italy's banking crisis, was rescued by the state in 2017 in an 8 billion euro bailout that also hit the bank's shareholders and junior bondholders.
To replenish its Tier2 capital following a debt-to-equity conversion carried out as part of its rescue, Monte dei Paschi had a commitment to issue 1.45 billion euros in subordinated debt under the restructuring plan to 2021 that Italy agreed with the European Commission to clear the bailout.
Wednesday's bond sale will allow the bank to meet that commitment after being granted an extension by Brussels.
The bank sold a 750 million euro 10-year Tier2 bond in January 2018 but was then shut out of funding markets when a euro skeptical coalition came to power in Italy, rattling international investors.
Riding expectations of a monetary policy loosening after the summer, Monte dei Paschi again tapped junior bond markets in July 2019, selling a 300 million euro 10-year Tier2 bond at a steep 10.5%, almost double the 5.375% yield of the previous issue in January 2018.
Since then, the Italian government comprising the 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League has been replaced by a more EU-friendly coalition made up of the 5-Star and the mainstream Democratic Party.
In December Italy won an extension to the end of January of a deadline for the state to submit an outline of how it plans to re-privatise Monte dei Paschi by the end of 2021.
The government is also discussing with Brussels a scheme that would allow Monte dei Paschi to drastically lower its impaired loans without excessively eating into its capital buffers.
In an improvement cited by Moody's among reasons to raise the outlook, Monte dei Paschi has managed to reduce its soured loans to 12.5% of total lending, beating two years in advance a 12.9% target set by its restructuring plan.
That is still higher than the national average and the government's plan aims at cutting it to around 5% to make it easier for the bank to find a buyer, sources have said."

PNC Financial, one of the largest local U.S. lenders by assets, said its loan portfolio grew 6% to $239.8 billion, with commercial lending accounting for 67% of total loans.
The U.S. regional bank's net interest income rose marginally to $2.49 billion as higher loans and lower borrowing costs offset lower interest rates.
The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates thrice last year, pressuring banks' profits. 
The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based bank's net income attributable to common shareholders rose to $1.30 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.27 billion a year earlier.
On a per share basis, the bank earned $2.97, topping analysts' estimates of $2.93 per share.

Total revenue rose 6.2% to $4.61 billion.

DUBAI (Reuters) - JPMorgan (N:JPM) is the first major brokerage to initiate coverage of  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) with an ""overweight"", setting a price target of 37 riyals ($9.86) per share and saying it sees scope for an increase in the energy giant's proposed $75 billion base dividend.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Tuesday rated the company ""neutral"" with a price target of 41 riyals while HSBC on Wednesday initiated coverage of Aramco with a ""hold"" rating and a target of 36.80 riyals.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said it rates Aramco as ""neutral"", with a price target of 36 riyals per share.
""Aramco is unique. In terms of quality of assets, scale and profitability it dwarfs just about any company globally,"" BofA said in a note. ""Yet, at current valuations, most of the outstanding fundamental factors are already priced in.""
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) also gave Aramco neutral rating with a price target of 34.1 riyals.
Bernstein and Jefferies both initiated coverage of Aramco last month with ""underperform"" ratings saying the company had been priced at a premium to international oil majors in its December IPO despite governance issues.
""Our bullish view is predicated on its dividend growth outlook, with scope to increase the $75 billion baseline as production scales up,"" JPMorgan said in a note. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) had an ""underweight"" rating and a price target of 28.10 riyals, the lowest among investment banks that advised Aramco on its IPO.
JPMorgan said Aramco's ability to sell its oil at a premium, capital expenditure flexibility and low debt to equity ratio would allow it to distribute a higher percentage of cashflow.
The brokerage said Aramco is uniquely positioned to raise production with minimal incremental capital expenditure.
It said it could see Saudi production capacity rising to 15 million bpd from the current 12 million and production of 10 million citing increased appetite by the kingdom to regain its share of global oil demand growth as oil markets tighten.
At 1134 GMT, Aramco shares were down 0.6% at 34.65 riyals. They were priced at 32 riyals for their IPO. 

JPMorgan was one of nine global coordinators on Aramco's IPO, which raised a record of $29.4 billion including a greenshoe allocation of extra shares.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks eased off record highs on Wednesday and U.S. and German bond yields slipped, as euphoria over a U.S.-China trade deal was tempered by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying tariffs on Chinese goods would remain in place for now.
The 18-month trade spat should enter a quieter phase as U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He sign an initial agreement that would boost Chinese purchases of U.S. manufactured and agricultural goods, energy and services. 
Dubbed the Phase 1 deal, it may soothe markets which have been on edge as the conflict between the world's two largest economies hit hundreds of billions of dollars in goods, uprooted supply chains and slowed economic growth.

But share prices have pulled back from recent highs, with Wall Street closing weaker on Tuesday, MSCI's index of Asian shares outside Japan retreating from 19-month peaks and Japan's benchmark Nikkei likewise falling 0.5%, off a four-week high.
MSCI's all-country equity index edged into the red after two days of gains while all three New York indexes are set to open weaker, futures suggested
The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.1%. The retreat was triggered by Mnuchin's comments that U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would stay until the completion of a second phase of a U.S.-China trade agreement. Their eventual removal hinged on Beijing's compliance with the Phase 1 accord, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.
The news did not entirely surprise markets, however, and many attributed the pullback to profit-taking off the recent rally than to any turn in underlying sentiment.
""The Phase 1 deal had pretty much been priced in so (Mnuchin's) comments took some steam out of the market last night and that's feeding through into today,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, a portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management. 
The jittery mood gave a mild boost to safe-haven assets such as gold, with the precious metal ticking up 0.3% after two days of losses. The Japanese yen and high-grade bonds also firmed slightly, though the yen was just a whisker off 7-1/2-month lows of 110.22.
U.S. Treasury yields ticked down, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling more than 2 basis points to 1.7930%, hurt also by Tuesday's data showing consumer prices undershooting expectations in December, which could allow interest rates to stay unchanged this year.
German 10-year yields fell 3.5 bps, extending their fall from two-week highs after data showed the German economy grew by 0.6% in 2019, the weakest expansion rate since 2013 and a marked cooling from the previous year 
Markets are also weighing the potential impact of the U.S. government nearing publication of a rule that would expand its powers to block shipments to China's Huawei, as it seeks to squeeze the blacklisted firm.
""I think the Trump administration will continue to put pressure on China in this way or some other, even after signing a Phase 1 deal,"" Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance said.
Markets may also focus more on company earnings -- Refinitiv analysis suggests S&P 500 companies' earnings-per-share fell 0.6% in the last 2019 quarter-- the second straight quarterly decline.
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 earnings by quarter since 2015: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-RESULTS-OUTLOOK/0H001QXTVB9F/eikon.png) 
But expectations from the financial sector are higher, especially after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) posted record profits and Citi beat estimates on Tuesday. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) are among those reporting results later on Wednesday. 
""The market will see trade escalation taken off the table but it will start to focus on earnings. We saw huge multiple expansions in 2019 and that won't happen again until we see earnings coming through,"" Onuekwusi said.
On currency markets, the trade-reliant Australian dollar slipped 0.3% against the greenback while the euro was broadly flat.
The offshore yuan weakened slightly, a day after rising to its strongest level in six months of 6.865.
The British pound, down almost 2% this month, slipped further as below-forecast inflation data prompted money markets to ramp up expectations of an interest rate cut as soon as this month.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>","As Aramco hails record IPO, Abu Dhabi's ADNOC whips up $19 billion","By Rania El Gamal and Davide Barbuscia
Dubai (Reuters) - The talk's all been about  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), and the suspense of its historic drive to whip up international cash. But, more quietly, its Gulf oil peer ADNOC has also been courting foreign funds - and its efforts compare favorably.
Like Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi's economy was hit by a dramatic fall in oil prices in mid-2014, triggering a drive to reduce its dependence on crude. A central part of that has been to reform and modernize state champion ADNOC and attract foreign investment.
Unlike Aramco's push for a giant stock market listing, which has been highly publicized and closely watched, ADNOC has gone for a more staggered approach with its fundraising efforts, and there has been little overview of their scope by industry experts.
However the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, to give its full name, has raised more than $19 billion over the past three years from overseas investors, according to Reuters calculations based on publicly released size of investments, signing fees and share sales. 
That's equivalent to two-thirds of the $29.4 billion that Saudi Aramco raised in the biggest initial public offering (IPO) in history. Despite the record-breaking December listing, the bulk of the shares were sold to domestic investors after foreign institutions baulked at the valuation. 
ADNOC, which supplies nearly 3% of global oil demand, has for example struck deals with the world's largest fund manager BlackRock (N:BLK) and with U.S. investment firm KKR, a rare foray for both into national oil companies in the Middle East.
It has also sold stakes in its pipeline infrastructure and refining businesses.
While both Gulf state-controlled firms are aiming to replicate the model of oil majors by expanding in downstream, trading and petrochemicals, their funding strategies diverge, said Dmitry Marinchenko, analyst with Fitch rating agency.
""Aramco is raising funds mainly by conventional borrowing while ADNOC is using more sophisticated forms of funding, including selling minority stakes in subsidiaries,"" he said. ""ADNOC is more open to cooperation with international partners.""
It remains to be seen which approach to attracting investment will prove more fruitful in coming years. But at stake could be the companies' ability to successfully diversify from crude production and, more broadly, for the domestic economies that rely on them to weather oil price shocks.
""The biggest challenge is the uncertainty in the outlook for oil and the growing international scrutiny that all energy companies are facing because of climate change,"" said Helima Croft, managing director of RBC Capital Markets. 
PRINCE PUSHES FOR CHANGE
The reforms have been driven by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, de-facto ruler of the wider United Arab Emirates. Their roots can be traced back to 2016, when oil prices fell to $30 a barrel, hitting state revenues and exposing how sensitive Abu Dhabi finances were to volatile prices. 
The crown prince, known as MbZ, appointed ally Sultan al-Jaber as CEO of ADNOC with a plan to restructure the company to make it more efficient and function more like a major than a state monopoly.
Al-Jaber swiftly embarked on plans to reshuffle ADNOC's leadership and slashed 5,000 jobs, mainly foreigners, out of its 60,000 employees. 
It is no easy task to change the course of an organization viewed as one of the most conservative in the region, however. ADNOC's production depended on decades-old concessions with Western oil majors, some of which have been operating in the UAE since the 1930s, and new deals and foreign investment were uncommon.
In April 2016, two months after installing al-Jaber, MbZ made a rare visit to ADNOC's headquarters to deliver a wake-up call to managers and staff.
His message, demanding a sharp change in a culture of entitlement, was unexpected in a nation where most citizens expect guaranteed state jobs with long-term security.
He told ADNOC employees they should feel no sense of entitlement, and that the UAE cannot be chained to oil price fluctuations anymore, whether at $30 or $100 a barrel, said Haif Zamzam, vice president of transformation and business supply at ADNOC who was present during the crown prince's visit. 
""He said 'You show me your CV and you show me your experience, you show me what you are able to actually do, and you have great opportunities,"" said Zamzam, who had worked with al-Jaber at state investor Mubadala.
The visit sent a message to ADNOC's old guard that he would not brook any opposition, said people familiar with the company.
""People used to come to ADNOC to clock in and clock out and leave at 2pm, and they expect their children to also work there. That is not the case anymore,"" said one UAE-based industry source.
STRETCHING THE DOLLAR
Al-Jaber, a minister of state and a former CEO at Mubadala's energy unit who holds a PhD in business and economics, was tasked with making ADNOC profitable enough to contribute to the UAE's budget even with lower oil prices. 
""We wanted to challenge the conventional business model of the National Oil Company,"" he told Reuters in an interview at his office on the 63rd floor of ADNOC's skyscraper HQ. 
""To make it simple - we are in the business of stretching the dollar from every barrel we produce.""
ADNOC does not publish financial results but, nonetheless, investors appear to like the changes. 
KKR's investment in 2019, its first as a direct investment in the region, was due to ADNOC's reforms, a spokesman for the U.S. firm said.
ADNOC has formed new partnerships with European and Asian energy firms such as Italy's Eni (MI:ENI) and China's CNPC to boost its oil, gas and trading businesses, and was the first foreign company with a deal to store oil in India's strategic reserves.
In his drive to emulate oil majors, al-Jaber has lured employees from  Total  (PA:TOTF), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and  BP  (L:BP) to launch new trading operations. He has also led a change in the way ADNOC plans to change the way it prices its oil by establishing a new crude benchmark.
The pace of the reforms has surprised industry players.
""He transformed the company,"" said Claudio Descalzi, CEO of Eni, one of ADNOC's newest partners.

371,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 06:33AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Is Biggest Aramco Bear as Banks Begin Ratings,"(Bloomberg) -- While shareholders greeted Saudi Aramco's (SE:2222) record initial public offering enthusiastically, the investment banks on the deal aren’t so bullish, with most recommending investors avoid the stock as they kicked off research coverage.
Of the 13 banks tracked by Bloomberg that have begun following the stock, two recommend buying, seven have hold ratings and four say sell. The average 12-month price target is 32.64 riyals, a 5.8% drop from current levels, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), at 28.10 riyals, the lowest among the banks that arranged the sale.
The offering was hampered by investors’ unwillingness to value the company at $2 trillion, as sought by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Investment banks’ estimates ran from $1.1 trillion to $2.5 trillion, but when fund managers balked at the high end, the kingdom scrapped a planned international offering and sold shares only on the domestic market.
The stock price already reflects Aramco’s strengths, such as its low production costs, long reserve life and strong free cash flow, said Morgan Stanley, which has an underperform rating.
The target takes into consideration Aramco’s high oil price sensitivity, exposure to geopolitical risks and limited influence that minority investors are likely to have, Morgan Stanley’s Martijn Rats said in a report.
While JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and Arqaam Capital Ltd. have buy recommendations on Aramco,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). has the highest price target, 41 riyals, to go with its neutral rating.
Aramco stands out from the rest of the industry “on both quality and scale metrics,” Goldman’s Michele Della Vigna wrote in a report.
Aramco fell 0.6% to 34.65 riyals at 2:05 p.m. in Riyadh, giving the company a market value of $1.85 trillion, the highest in the world. The stock is up 8.3% from its IPO price of 32 riyals, though down from a closing peak of 38 riyals last month.
At the time of the offering, many foreign investors cited high valuation, corporate governance and geopolitical risk as reasons to stay away from the shares.
The deal ended relying mostly on Gulf individual and institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds from neighboring Abu Dhabi and Kuwait.

Jewellery chain operator  Chow Tai Fook  Jewellery Group Ltd (HK:1929) said on Wednesday it would review the performance of more than 40 points of sale (PoS) with leases set to expire in the 2021 financial year, and planned to close up to 15 of them, many located in the tourist districts of Causeway Bay, Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui.
""As said in our interim results in November 2019, the group would seek PoS network optimization in Hong Kong to enhance store profitability,"" a company spokeswoman told Reuters in an email reply, adding there was nothing new in its direction.

Anti-government protests have rocked the Chinese-ruled city for more than seven months, taking a heavy toll on the economy, in particular the tourism and retail sectors.

378,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Europe Pauses Ahead of U.S.-China Signing; FTSE Rises,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were mixed after early trading Wednesday, after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sobering comments late Tuesday that the trade deal due to be signed later in the day with China in no ways ends the simmering conflict between the two.
The outlook for Europe’s stocks depends to a high degree on relations between the world’s two biggest countries: with the ECB’s ultra-loose monetary policy the only meaningful prop to demand at home, the euro zone in particular needs strong demand from China and the U.S. to support it. But exports to the former have suffered as the Chinese economy stuttered under the impact of U.S. tariffs, while exports to the latter are still threatened by the prospect of U.S. action against European producers, by an administration still eager to reduce the U.S.’s trade deficit with the EU.
The euro zone’s trade surplus fell back to 20.7 billion euros in November from 28 billion in October, but still shows no sign of returning to the broad balance it enjoyed before the crisis. That has not gone unnoticed in Washington.
A further brake on European stocks right now is what seems like giddyingly high valuations. After years of underperformance, many local investors seem not to trust the record highs that were posted at the end of 2019, even though a number of influential U.S. banks have said they now see Europe as offering more value than an overstretched U.S. market.
The Stoxx 600 rose 29% last year, its best performance in 20 years (even if that was flattered by a savage drop at the end of 2018). According to Dirk Steffen, head of capital market strategy at   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn), that translated into a price-earnings multiple of 14.4, up from 11.4 over a year earlier. However, that’s still well below the 18.3x forward multiple recorded by the S&P 500 right now.
“Although similar increases in valuations have preceded falls in profits and share prices in certain cases, I see only limited risks for 2020,” Steffen said in a morning note. Not only are Chinese and U.S. growth fundamentally strong enough to support further profit growth, but the miserable yields on offer on European bonds also leave investors with few attractive options.
That’s particularly important right now because European government bond issuance is set to hit its lowest in a decade this year, as a flood of post-crisis bonds mature, leaving investors with a difficult choice on where to reinvest.
In that context, Steffen notes that “the expected excess return of equities over German federal debt is at an all-time high.”
By 5:10 AM ET in Europe, the STOXX 600 was essentially flat at 419.54, while the FTSE 100 rose 0.2% after weak inflation data cemented expectations of an interest rate cut from the Bank of England. The German DAX was down 0.1% while the Spanish and Italian markets underperformed on broad weakness in banking names."

Flybe was rescued on Tuesday after its shareholders agreed to invest more money while the government provided support, reported to involve the deferral of a tax bill.
Walsh, chief executive of British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) and one of the biggest names in the industry, criticized the government support for a privately-held company, saying the taxpayer was picking up the tab for mismanagement of the airline. 
""This is a blatant misuse of public funds,"" he said in an emailed statement.
Walsh and other critics of the Flybe bail-out pointed to the fact that the carrier's ultimate owners surely had deep enough pockets to ensure the airline's survival without government help. 
British Airways competes against Flybe on some routes and Flybe is owned by a group which includes long term BA rival Virgin Atlantic, plus Stobart Group (L:STOB) and investment adviser Cyrus Capital.
Virgin Atlantic is 51% owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group with the balance held by another BA rival, Delta (N:DAL), the second biggest U.S. airline by passenger numbers with a market capitalization of $40 billion.
Under pressure to deliver on an election promise to help improve transport links outside London, the government agreed to help Flybe, in contrast to a similar test last September when it took no action to help save the much larger travel company Thomas Cook. 
Flybe connects smaller UK cities such as Southampton and Newcastle and its network of routes includes more than half of UK domestic flights outside London.

Walsh has also written a letter to Transport Minister Grant Shapps, said the BBC, outlining his concerns about the Flybe deal.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos said his company will invest $1 billion to bring small businesses online in India, reaching out to some of his fiercest critics in a goodwill visit that saw him donning traditional Indian attire and fly a kite with children.
Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart have been hit with a barrage of criticism from India's brick-and-mortar retailers who accuse the U.S. giants of violating Indian law with deep discounts and discriminating against small sellers by promoting select big ones. The companies deny the allegations.
Just this week, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) launched an anti-trust probe to look into those allegations.
Amazon said it will setup digital centers in 100 Indian cities and villages to help businesses get online to sell their goods and will offer support in marketing and logistics.
The investment of $1 billion will help bring more than 10 million Indian businesses online and enable exports of India-made goods worth $10 billion by 2025, it added.
Speaking at a company event at a New Delhi stadium which Amazon described as ""a first-of-its-kind mega summit"" bringing together more than 3,000 small businesses, Bezos praised India and said Amazon was committed to being its long-term partner.
""The dynamism, the energy ... the growth. This country has something special,"" Bezos, who wore a blue-colored traditional Indian jacket, said to the audience which responded with cheers.
Other events in India have included Bezos paying his respects to a memorial dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi. Sources say he has sought a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other government officials.
The Confederation of All India Traders, a group representing roughly 70 million brick-and-mortar retailers, has said it will protest in 300 cities during Bezos' visit.
But protests so far have been small. At one in New Delhi and another in the eastern state of Odisha on Wednesday, there were about 50 demonstrators each. 
""We are not able to compete. There is an unhealthy competition,"" said Girish Prasad Ratha, a demonstrator who said he had lost 15% of his sales in the last two years because customers were increasingly going online.
The company maintains it provides opportunities to more than 550,000 sellers on its platform to grow their business in India. 
India's e-commerce market revenues are set to touch $120 billion this year, having grown 51% annually between 2017 and 2020, according to a study by the CCI.
The $1 billion investment announced on Wednesday adds to $5.5 billion of investments in India announced by Amazon since 2014.

Bezos, who arrived on Tuesday, is due to fly out on Saturday.

Investing.com - European stock markets registered small losses after the open Wednesday, taking their tone from Tuesday’s close on Wall Street, amid caution ahead of the signing of the trade deal between the U.S. and China. Confirmation of the slowest German economic growth in six years also weighed.
Market participants are mindful of the still-simmering tensions between the two countries.
At 04:15 ET (0915 GMT), the DAX dropped 20 points, or 0.2%. France's CAC 40 was 7 points, or 0.1%, lower, while the FTSE 100 in the U.K. outperformed, climbing 5 points, or 0.1%. The benchmark Euro STOXX 600, fell 1 point, or 0.1%, to 419.24.
This follows on from the broad-basedS&P 500 easing back from record highs to close down 0.2% on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2% but the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, helped by some strong bank earnings, closing up 0.1%.
U.S. and Chinese officials are scheduled to sign the deal Wednesday in Washington. It had been hoped that this would lead fairly promptly to a de-escalation of trade hostilities between the two economic powerhouses. But U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin late Tuesday dismissed the idea that this agreement could prompt the rolling back of more tariffs on China after the U.S. presidential election in late 2020.
""The tariffs will stay in place until there is a phase two. If the president gets phase two quickly, he will consider releasing tariffs. If not, there won't be any tariff relief,"" Mnuchin said on Bloomberg TV.
With the “phase two” negotiations likely to be more complex, this could take some time.
That said, losses were minor, helped by the largely positive tone from Wall Street's blue chips at the start of the U.S. earnings season. The banks are often taken as a rough proxy for the health of the broader economy.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) were able to post strong double-digit earnings growth in the final three months of 2019, despite falling interest rates, both reporting robust consumer lending figures. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported its most profitable year on record.
Banks will again be in focus Wednesday, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) due to report. Additionally, November industrial production and trade numbers for the EU are due for release.
Turning back to Europe, shares in   Tullow Oil   (LON:TLW) climbed 2.9% after the company reported write-offs of around $1.5 billion, citing a $10/bbl reduction in its long-term accounting oil price assumption. While never good news, this offered some hope that the worst of its share price decline is over.
Also of interest is   Safran   (PA:SAF), the French aerospace-component manufacturer. Its shares climb 1% after its investment case was upgraded to buy from neutral by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The bank’s analyst sees upside now after a period of underperformance.
Elsewhere, U.S. crude oil futures traded down 0.5% at $57.92 and the international benchmark Brent also fell 0.4% to $64.22. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX rose 0.5% to $1,552.45."

(Reuters) - European shares were flat on Wednesday ahead of the signing of an initial trade deal between Washington and Beijing, as comments from the U.S. Treasury Secretary on China tariffs somewhat dimmed optimism. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.01% by 0850 GMT. 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said tariffs on Chinese goods would remain until a second phase of a U.S.-China trade deal. His comments came hours before the signing of an agreement that seeks to ease prolonged trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.
The Phase 1 deal will lead to China buying more U.S. products, but does not tackle issues such as subsidies. However, the fine print on the deal is yet to be released. 
""Markets aren't going to be moving in any reasonable way until we get things declared in terms of details on the deal,"" said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets in London.
""We're getting some sort of deal, that's why we've been setting record highs. And given that how much positive news has been baked in, the deal would have to be phenomenal to trigger a next round of buying."" 
Healthcare (SXDP) was the best performing sector, led by a 3.5% rise in pharmaceuticals developer  Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  AB (ST:SOBIV). Madden said the sector was benefiting from defensive plays, given that there was a dearth of major market-driving news.
Dutch semiconductor supplier ASM International (AS:ASMI) was the best performer on the STOXX 600, hitting a record high after it reported a strong fourth-quarter order intake.
Automobile stocks (SXAP) were the worst performers in the euro zone, shedding about 0.8%.
German car parts maker Hella GMBH (DE:HLE) extended losses to a second session after it posted lower first-half earnings and warned that a strong market recovery was unlikely.
Stocks in Germany (GDAXI) fell about 0.1% after the EU bloc's biggest economy marked a GDP growth of 0.6% in 2019, the weakest expansion rate since 2013.

Talks between EU and U.S. trade representatives in Washington this week are also a point of focus, given the strained relations between the two over U.S. tariffs and aircraft subsidy disputes.

""Is it really a good idea that we don't allow the creation of a European global champion? In doing so, we risk being outperformed by a Chinese company, over which the European Union has no influence,"" Maersk CEO Soren Skou told Danish business daily Finans. 
A Maersk spokeswoman confirmed his comments to Reuters. 
Skou is a member of the European Round Table for Industry (ERT), a lobby group of 55 CEOs and chairs of large European companies. Last month, the group urged the EU to develop a new strategy to enhance global competitiveness.
The calls came after Brussels last year blocked a merger of the rail divisions of  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and  Alstom  (PA:ALSO).
The collapse of the deal prompted Germany and France to call for an overhaul of EU competition policy to better meet global challenges.
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said at the time she had blocked the merger to protect competition in the European railway industry, dismissing Siemens and Alstom's argument about merging to compete with their bigger Chinese state-owned rival CRRC (SS:601766) in the European market.
""Competition policy should not be just about protecting consumers. That is super important, but if it does not allow us to build the right European companies that can compete globally, it could become a huge problem for the EU in the long run,"" Skou said.
""We cannot allow the United States and China to win the global technology race, while we spend our time discussing issues that belong to industries of the last century.""
In response to his comments, a European Commission spokeswoman told Reuters that EU policy had ""not impeded the creation of European champions"".
""Over the years, the commission has cleared numerous large mergers that created European champions or allowed them to grow, such as Peugeot's takeover of Opel and InBev's acquisition of SABMiller (LON:SAB),"" the spokeswoman said.

She added that Siemens and Alstom were already global champions in the rail sector and that a merger was not needed for them to be able to compete globally.

“Europe must choose the right path and return to the nuclear deal,” Rouhani said in a statement shown live on state TV. “Mr. Johnson, I don’t know what he’s thinking when says that instead of the nuclear deal, we should implement a Trump plan. Other than violate international contracts, what else has Trump done?”
Addressing a cabinet meeting, Rouhani said steps Tehran has so far taken to scale back its compliance with the agreement are all reversible. Those measures were taken in response to the U.S. abandoning the nuclear accord and reimposing sanctions on Iran.

The fine, the biggest ever given by the regulator, is the latest chapter in a global emissions cheating scandal that has cost Volkswagen about 30 billion euros in fines, vehicle refits and legal costs, and also triggered a global backlash against diesel vehicles.
""False information in advertising materials caused misinformation - they referred to Volkswagen's pro-ecological attitude, when in fact the cars were not environmentally friendly,"" UOKiK president Marek Niechcial said in a statement.
Volkswagen in 2015 admitted to cheating U.S. emissions tests on diesel engines.

As part of a two-year deal, Isuzu will test Honda's fuel cell powertrain, which was designed for passenger cars, in Isuzu's commercial trucks, the companies said, which could pave the way for using the technology in a wider range of vehicles.
Automakers are looking to develop more electric vehicles (EVs) to comply with tightening global emissions regulations.
Many see battery-powered EVs as a solution for passenger cars in urban settings, but a growing number see hydrogen fuel cells as an effective way to power trucks, buses and other big vehicles.
""Although we have done extensive R&D into passenger FCVs (fuel cell vehicles), we have not been able to study how best to apply the technology to commercial vehicles,"" a Honda spokesman told reporters at a briefing.
""This partnership will allow us to do that.""
Fuel cell vehicles generate their own electricity using hydrogen stored in onboard tanks.
This enables them to travel longer distances and refuel more quickly than battery EVs, while using less costly energy storage systems.
""We think that FCV technology is well suited for heavier trucks which travel longer distances, and this partnership will enable us to examine this further,"" an Isuzu spokeswoman said, adding that the truck maker was also developing various lower-carbon powertrains including battery-electric technology for shorter-distance vehicles.
With its Clarity Fuel Cell sedan, Honda is one of a handful of automakers which have developed and marketed fuel cell-powered passenger cars.
Light- and medium-sized truck specialist Isuzu has for years has focused on diesel engine technology and has yet to market fully electric vehicles.
But a price tag starting around $70,000 for the Clarity and scant hydrogen fuelling infrastructure globally, Honda has seen limited take-up of that model and other FCVs since they began marketing them around 2015.
In 2018 Honda sold just 654 Clarity FCVs, which are available only in Japan and the United States through leasing programs, compared with Honda's total annual global sales of 5.23 million cars.
The partnership is the latest in a growing trend among vehicle makers joining forces to better compete in an industry upended by the rise of electric vehicles, self-driving cars and other new technologies.
Honda and Isuzu are reviving their vehicle partnership following an agreement in the early l990s under which Isuzu manufactured sport utility vehicles for Honda in the North American market.

KUALA LUMPUR/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Malaysia Airlines said on Wednesday it had suspended deliveries of 25  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX jets, citing the plane's delayed return to service since it was grounded last year following two fatal crashes.
The decision represents another setback for Boeing, which on Tuesday reported its worst annual net orders in decades, along with its lowest number of plane deliveries in 11 years, as the grounding of the 737 MAX saw it fall far behind main competitor Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
""In view of the production stoppage and the delayed return to service of the 737-MAX, Malaysia Airlines has suspended the delivery of its orders,"" the airline said in an email, without saying when it wanted the deliveries to resume. 
""As there is no clarity yet from various authorities on its return to service, our technical due diligence is still ongoing,"" Malaysia Airlines said.
The airline said it had previously planned to have five 737 MAX jets delivered this year, the first in July. Last year, its chief executive had said it was possible the craft's introduction to service could slide beyond July.
Boeing said it was sorry for the disruption the 737 MAX situation had caused Malaysia Airlines.
""We are working to support them and all of our customers in every way possible to ensure complete confidence in the 737 MAX and a safe return to commercial flight,"" Boeing said in a statement.
The Malaysian government has been seeking a buyer for the debt-heavy airline, which is still recovering from two tragedies in 2014, when flight MH370 disappeared in what remains a mystery and flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine.
Analysts said cash-strapped carriers like Malaysia Airlines that over-ordered planes could take advantage of the 737 MAX grounding to negotiate with Boeing to restructure their orders.
 Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH) said last year it would delay taking the first deliveries of 737 MAX jets for nearly two years to reduce capital spending.
 Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NWC) said last year its Dublin-based leasing subsidiary had reached an agreement with Boeing to postpone delivery of 14 737 MAX planes that were originally due in 2020 and 2021.

Boeing on Tuesday reported a net negative of 183 orders for the 737 MAX in 2019 including cancellations, but many were associated with the collapse of a major customer, India's Jet Airways Ltd (NS:JET).

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open marginally lower Wednesday, taking their tone from the small losses seen on Wall Street on Tuesday as worries emerged over the effective impact of the expected trade deal between the U.S. and China
Market participants are mindful of the still-simmering tensions between the two countries.
At 02:00 ET (0700 GMT), futures on the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index were trading 15 points, or 0.2%, lower. Futures on France's CAC 40 were 6 points, or 0.1%, lower, while the DAX futures dropped 53 points, or 0.4%. 
This follows on from the broad-based S&P 500 easing back from record highs to close down 0.2% on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2% but the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, helped by some strong bank earnings, closing up 0.1%.
U.S. and Chinese officials are scheduled to sign the deal Wednesday in Washington. It had been hoped that this would lead fairly promptly to a de-escalation of trade hostilities between the two economic powerhouses. But U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin late Tuesday dismissed the idea that this agreement could prompt the rolling back of more tariffs on China after the U.S. presidential election in late 2020.
""The tariffs will stay in place until there is a phase two. If the president gets phase two quickly, he will consider releasing tariffs. If not, there won't be any tariff relief,"" Mnuchin said on Bloomberg TV.
With the “phase two” negotiations likely to be more complex, this could take some time.
That said, losses were minor, helped by the largely positive tone from Wall Street's blue chips at the start of the U.S. earnings season. The banks are often taken as a rough proxy for the health of the broader economy.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). were able to post strong double-digit earnings growth in the final three months of 2019, despite falling interest rates, both reporting robust consumer lending figures. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported its most profitable year on record.
Banks will again be in focus Wednesday, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) due to report. Additionally, inflation data for France, Spain and the U.K. are scheduled for release, along with November industrial production and trade numbers for the EU.
Elsewhere, crude has slipped back, in line with the moves in equity markets, while gold has become more popular.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) unveiled the first sport-utility vehicle (SUV) under its Genesis brand on Wednesday, a move analysts said was crucial for the premium marque's expansion in overseas markets.
The brand, spun off in 2015, is an initiative of Hyundai Motor Group heir-apparent Euisun Chung aimed at revamping the image of the value-for-money automaker.
However, its sedan-only lineup has limited its reach in the United States - its biggest overseas market - where consumer preference has shifted to SUVs, and where Hyundai has been embroiled in disputes with dealerships. 
The automaker plans to launch the GV80 SUV in North America in the first quarter of 2020. It expects the model to be part of a strengthened lineup that will also lead the brand's expansion in China and Europe where it has yet to make inroads, William Lee, Global Head of Genesis, told a news conference.
Genesis' lineup currently comprises just three sedans, which analysts said limits its appeal, particularly with the increased demand for SUVs among younger drivers in recent years.
""Genesis owners are some of the oldest in the U.S. market. With a median age of 62, only Cadillac and Lincoln owners are older,"" Ed Kim, vice president at California-based consultancy AutoPacific, told Reuters.
""It (the GV80) will ... have the role of bringing younger buyers to the brand,"" he said. 
The brand made progress rebuilding its U.S. retail network in 2019 after flip-flopping on strategy for separate dealerships to those of Hyundai-branded vehicles which led to legal disputes with Hyundai dealers. 
About 350 Hyundai dealerships in the United States have Genesis showrooms, with about a dozen in the ""early stages"" of developing plans for separate Genesis retail facilities, U.S.-based Genesis spokesman Kevin Smith said in an emailed statement. 

Over 70% of Genesis vehicles were sold in South Korea in January-November 2019, with the rest sold mainly in the United States.

(Reuters) - Celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti was arrested on Tuesday on accusations that he violated the terms of his release from custody while awaiting trial on charges that he sought to extort millions of dollars from  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE)., federal prosecutors said.
Avenatti, 48, whose trial in the Nike case is set to start next week, was taken into custody by agents from the Internal Revenue Service, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles.
Mrozek said that he could not discuss the allegations that led to Avenatti's arrest because the documents had been sealed by a judge. An arrest warrant filed in U.S. District Court in New York does not spell out the accusations.
Avenatti, who gained international notoriety representing adult film star Stormy Daniels in a legal battle with U.S. President Donald Trump, was scheduled to appear in federal court in Santa Ana on Wednesday.
Earlier Tuesday, a federal judge in New York rejected a request by Avenatti to delay his trial in the Nike case after his lawyers complained that prosecutors had overwhelmed them with a ""document dump"" of new material.
Avenatti is accused of threatening to make public a client's claims that Nike had made improper payments to families of college basketball recruits unless the sportswear company paid him to conduct an internal investigation for $15 million to $25 million, and pay an additional $1.5 million to the client.
Avenatti has pleaded not guilty. Nike has denied any wrongdoing.
The high-profile lawyer also faces an April 21 trial in Manhattan over accusations he cheated Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract, and a May 19 trial in Santa Ana, California over allegations of defrauding clients out of millions of dollars and lying to the Internal Revenue Service.
He has also pleaded not guilty to those charges.
Avenatti became a prominent critic of Trump and frequent cable TV guest while representing Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.
Daniels sued Trump over a nondisclosure agreement that in the weeks before the 2016 U.S. presidential election kept her from discussing her claims that they had had an extramarital affair 10 years earlier.
Avenatti faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted on the California charges and up to 20 years in the New York indictment."

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Carlos and Carole Ghosn, the former first couple of carmaker Nissan, are united again in Beirut. They hold hands in the street and whisper together in a mix of Arabic and French. They kiss.
But the pair's most visceral display of unity comes when they talk about Carlos Ghosn's former home.
""I'm done with Japan,"" said Carole Ghosn in an interview with her husband in a private house in Beirut.
Two weeks ago, Carlos Ghosn made a dramatic escape from house arrest in Japan, where he was awaiting trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds. He denies all charges.
Shortly after Ghosn appeared in Beirut, Japanese authorities issued an arrest warrant for Carole on suspicion of alleged perjury related to the misappropriation charge against her husband.
""What they're accusing me of is a bit of a joke,"" said the 54-year-old Lebanese-American national, who spent many years as a fashion designer in New York and whose children live in the U.S. city. 
""I testified for hours and they told me you are free to go, and now, nine months later... this comes up. They are vindictive. This has nothing to do with the law.""
Carlos Ghosn was even more adamant. ""I spent 18 years in Japan; I never suspected this brutality, this lack of fairness, this lack of empathy.""
Tokyo prosecutors have said his allegations of a conspiracy are false and that he has failed to justify his acts.
The plan to flee to his childhood home of Lebanon developed quickly with a small group of people, a ""reasonable price"" and utter secrecy, he said.
""The first rule if you want to do something like is that no member of your family should be aware because they become very anxious,"" he added.
Asked whether she would have dissuaded him to escape, Carole Ghosn blurted: ""Yes!""
But then she paused, looked at her husband and added: ""No. I mean, actually, let me rephrase. If you told me this at the beginning, I would have said No, of course not. You're going to fight this and prove your innocence... But then, with time, we saw how the prosecutors were behaving... I said 'Oh my God my husband is never going to get a fair trial' and I was desperate.""
""I'm happy he did it,"" she said.
Japan's justice minister has said Ghosn's escape from his trial could constitute a crime.
HUMAN RIGHTS FOCUS
Beirut has no extradition agreement with Japan and Ghosn's legal team is pushing for him to stand trial in Lebanon. But Ghosn said last week that he does not want his own case to hurt relations between Lebanon, which is currently in the throes of an economic crisis, and the world's third-largest economy. 
The Ghosns have been attempting to focus the narrative on the question of human rights — and what they say is the inhumane way that Ghosn was treated after his arrest in late 2018. Ghosn says he was held in isolation, given only limited access to his lawyers and – his biggest complaint – prevented from speaking to his wife. The couple had been married for two years — second unions for both — when Ghosn was first arrested. He says they spoke for only two hours in nine months.
""They wanted to break me, they wanted to put me into a situation where life was miserable,"" he said.
Japan's Justice Minister Masako Mori has called the accusations ""absolutely intolerable.""
During his arrest, Carole Ghosn said she sought the support of Human Rights Watch, hired a high-profile human rights lawyer in Paris, and appealed directly to President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron to help her husband's case. 
Carlos Ghosn said he was determined up until late last year to stay in Japan and see through the investigation and his trial. On Christmas Day, he said, he realized the legal cases could last five years and decided to bolt. 
The Ghosns said their life in Beirut consists of working with their legal team and spending evenings with friends.
Both have their regrets - including, for Carole Ghosn, throwing a lavish party at the 17th century palace in Versailles, France, for her 50th birthday. The party has become part of a separate investigation in France to establish if the venue was obtained improperly by the Ghosns (which both deny), and has also prompted criticism of the couple as leading an extravagant lifestyle. 
""It was a beautiful event, and now it has turned out to be a big disaster,"" said Carole Ghosn. ""Now, I look at it, it's unfortunate - I wish we never did it.""
Both said they would be happy to stay in Lebanon, for the rest of their lives, if that was necessary.
As for returning to Japan?

""Never,"" said Carole.

396,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 11:01PM ET</span>",Ghosn says French envoy told him Nissan was turning against him,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn, speaking in Beirut after his dramatic escape from Japanese justice, said on Tuesday that the French ambassador had warned him shortly after his arrest that his own company was plotting against him.
""Frankly, I was shocked by the arrest and the first thing I asked is make sure Nissan knows so they can send me a lawyer,"" Ghosn told Reuters in an interview in Beirut. 
""And the second day, 24 hours from this, I received a visit from the French ambassador who told me: 'Nissan is turning against you'. And this is where I realized that the whole thing was a plot.""
Former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced to resign last year after admitting that he had received improper compensation, told a news conference hours after Ghosn's arrest that Ghosn had been using corporate money for personal purposes and under-reporting his income for years.
The arrest of Ghosn, widely respected for rescuing the carmaker from near-bankruptcy, has put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny.
The French Embassy in Tokyo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Nissan reiterated a previous comment, including that the car maker ""discovered numerous acts of misconduct by Ghosn through a robust, thorough internal investigation. The company determined that he was not fit to serve as an executive, and removed him from all offices."" 
It said that in addition to the Japanese prosecution, Ghosn was found to have committed ""fraudulent"" underreporting of his compensation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and that French authorities were investigating. 
Among the practices now under the spotlight are keeping suspects in detention for long periods and excluding defense lawyers from interrogations, which can last eight hours a day.
""When he told me that 'two hours or three hours later, after your arrest, Saikawa went in a press conference and made his infamous statement where he said, you know, 'I am horrified, but what I'm learning...'' - so when he told me he made these statements, I said 'Oh my God this is a plot'.""
Ghosn, 65, fled Japan last month while awaiting trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.
The one-time titan of the car industry said the alternative to fleeing would have been to spend the rest of his life languishing in Japan without a fair trial. Ghosn said he had escaped to his childhood home of Lebanon in order to clear his name. He noted that there were conflicting stories about his astonishing escape, but declined to say how he had managed to flee.
Tokyo prosecutors said his allegations of a conspiracy were false and that he had failed to justify his acts. The 14-month saga has shaken the global auto industry and jeopardized the Renault-Nissan alliance, of which Ghosn was the mastermind.
Japan's Ministry of Justice has said it will try to find a way to bring Ghosn back from Lebanon, even the countries have no extradition treaty.

Ghosn said the Japanese authorities were intent on preventing him from having a just trial.

Investing.com - Asian equities traded lower on Wednesday morning after a report suggested that the U.S. would not suspend more Chinese tariffs until after the 2020 U.S. election in November.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.6% and 0.5% respectively by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was also down 0.5%.
Existing tariffs on imported Chinese goods are likely to remain in place until November, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter said.
The report also said that a phase two deal was not expected before the election. 
The news soured investor sentiment and sent global stocks lower today. 
“There’s always ‘buy the rumor, sell the news.’ Part of the reason why we had this tremendous, incredible rally last year and especially toward the end of the year, and why we got off to a good start this year, was we had a raft of good news, on earnings, and also on China trade,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA in a CNBC report.
“Stocks are not cheap and any bit of news could have an impact on the market.”
Officials from Beijing and Washington are expected to sign the phase one trade deal, which was agreed in principle in December, later in the day at the White House.
In other news, the People’s Bank of China added 300 billion yuan ($44 billion) through the medium-term lending facility at 3.25%, according to a statement from the central bank. 
The measures are expected to help with this year’s earlier-than-usual sale of local government debt.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investor Jeffrey Ubben, already betting there is money to be made from coaxing corporations into being better citizens, gained an ally on Tuesday when BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) chief Laurence Fink told companies to tackle climate change or face his wrath.
Ubben, who founded $17 billion ValueAct Capital in 2000, spent a year building an ESG portfolio and is fast becoming one of Wall Street's biggest evangelists for investments with strong environmental, social and governance components.
Now a like-minded and powerful investor has joined the crusade as Fink sent his annual letter to corporate chiefs warning them to act or face anger from investors like BlackRock over how unsustainable business practices might curb their future wealth.
""It is pretty exciting,"" Ubben said at a Reuters BreakingViews event on Tuesday when asked about Fink sounding the alarm on a crisis that Fink called the most long-term and structural in his over 40-year long career in finance.
For Ubben and other investors pushing for changes on things ranging from carbon emissions to safer workplaces for employees, BlackRock's new stance may aid their work. Fink said BlackRock, which invests $7 trillion and is the world's biggest asset manager, would be ""increasingly disposed"" to cast critical proxy votes tied to sustainability.
""Now I can call three shareholders,"" Ubben said, referring to index funds BlackRock, Vanguard and  State Street  (NYSE:STT).
""If I can turn that vote on, (these changes) can happen fast. It is pretty cool.""
Three years ago Ubben elevated a long-term partner, Mason Morfit, to chief investment officer at ValueAct and took time to step back and lay the ground work for the ValueAct Spring fund. The fund quickly attracted over $1 billion but Ubben then hit the pause button and began turning potential investors away.
""I want to go slowly,"" Ubben said, noting that he needs to take time to construct the fund carefully and spend time identifying the portfolio companies. And he still has to find ways to catalyze real change with these types of investments.
One of the Spring fund's investments is Hawaiian Electric (N:HE) where Ubben has been pushing for the company to consider outsiders to replace CEO Constance Lau. Ubben said ValueAct is working with the company and declined to say whether he wants a board seat to help hasten change.
Ubben said most companies were guilty of short-term thinking, and only about a third of corporate chiefs want to do good by, for example, investing in clean energy or boosting employee wages.
The remainder were simply trying to shield themselves from activist investors like himself, he added.
But as ESG investing captures investors' imagination - investors funneled $20.6 billion in net new money into these types of funds last year, according to Morningstar data - Ubben said it can become the path to breaking the short-term investing mold.
""ESG, that's the ticket that's how we get the long-term back,"" he said.
Paving the road to real change requires ""courage and getting off the 90 day clock,"" Ubben said, referring to the typical company reporting cycle.
Ubben said that in recent years he has stopped growing his own net worth and gives away his income. But not everyone in the hedge fund industry is as generous, he acknowledged.
""This is an industry populated by people who have a (money) hoarding problem,"" he said."

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump lashed out at Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Tuesday, castigating the iPhone maker for what he said was its refusal to unlock phones used by criminals while benefiting from government help on trade.
Trump's tweet came amid the investigation into the fatal shooting of three Americans by a Saudi Air Force officer at the U.S. Naval Station in Pensacola, Florida, last month, which Attorney General William Barr called “an act of terrorism” on Monday.
The episode marks the latest flare-up in a privacy debate between technology companies such as Apple and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and authorities. 
The tech companies argue that strong encryption protects the privacy and security of their users, while law enforcement officials say criminals have used the technology to evade justice and called on tech firms to provide a way to crack it, using high-profile cases such as Pensacola and the 2015 mass shooting by Islamic militants in San Bernardino, California, as examples.
Trump on Tuesday had harsh words for Apple.
""We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements,"" the U.S. president said on Twitter. ""They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW!"" he said.
Apple has said it cannot access data that is encrypted with a passcode and stored on an iPhone and that it would have to build a specific tool for doing so, known in the tech industry as a ""backdoor."" The company can and does, however, hand over data stored on its cloud storage servers to law enforcement officials, which often includes backups of iPhones, including iMessages.
Apple did not respond to a request for comment on Trump's tweet. On Monday, the company said it rejected “the characterization that Apple has not provided substantive assistance."" 
Earlier on Monday Barr called on Apple to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock two iPhones involved in the Pensacola case.
Apple said it had responded to seven separate legal requests from federal investigators in December, starting the day of the shooting.
The company said it turned over ""many gigabytes"" of data to investigators, including iCloud backups, account information and transactional data for multiple accounts. Apple said the FBI did not request help unlocking phones until Jan. 6, with a request for a second iPhone sent on Jan. 8.
“A federal judge has authorized the Department of Justice to access the contents of the dead terrorist’s phones. Apple designed these phones and implemented their encryption. It’s a simple, 'front-door' request: Will Apple help us get into the shooter’s phones or not?” Kerri Kupec, a Department of Justice spokeswoman, said in a statement on Tuesday.
In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union called Trump's demand ""dangerous and unconstitutional"" and said it would weaken the security of millions of iPhones.
""There is simply no way for Apple, or any other company, to provide the FBI access to encrypted communications without also providing it to authoritarian foreign governments and weakening our defenses against criminals and hackers,"" the ACLU said.
After the shooting in San Bernardino, California, in 2015, federal investigators eventually turned to third-party cybersecurity firms for help to unlock the shooter's device.

The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported that the devices used by the Pensacola shooter were older iPhone 5 and iPhone 7 models and cited cybersecurity experts as saying commercial firms could likely crack them.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 08:07PM ET</span>",U.S. to maintain tariffs on Chinese goods until Phase 2 deal: Mnuchin,"By Makini Brice and Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will maintain tariffs on Chinese goods until the completion of a second phase of a U.S.-China trade agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday, a day before the two sides are to sign an interim deal.
Mnuchin told reporters that President Donald Trump could consider easing tariffs if the world's two largest economies move quickly to seal a follow-up agreement.
""If the president gets a Phase 2 in place quickly, he'll consider releasing tariffs as part of Phase 2,"" Mnuchin said.
Trump is slated to sign the Phase 1 trade agreement with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House on Wednesday at 11:30 a.m. (1630 GMT). The signing occurs a week before the U.S. Senate is due to begin its impeachment trial of the U.S. president.
Trump became only the third U.S. president to be impeached when the House last month approved charges that he abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden and obstructed Congress.
Concerns about the trade deal weighed on U.S. stocks on Tuesday, sending shares lower after a Bloomberg report suggested U.S. tariffs could remain in place until after the November presidential election.
New data showed that the costs of Trump's trade wars were proving more widespread, deeper and longer-lasting https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-effects/drag-from-trumps-trade-wars-continues-to-ripple-through-us-economy-idUSKBN1ZD2GU to American manufacturing competitiveness and jobs than previously believed.
Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said earlier there was no agreement in place with China on further tariff reductions.
In a joint statement, they said all aspects of the Phase 1 trade deal with China would be made public on Wednesday, except a confidential annex that will detail U.S. products and services to be purchased by China.
""There are no other oral or written agreements between the United States and China on these matters, and there is no agreement for future reduction in tariffs. Any rumors to the contrary are categorically false,"" they said.
After the Phase 1 deal was reached last month, Washington agreed to suspend tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese-made cellphones, laptop computers and other goods that were due to take effect on Dec. 15, and to halve existing tariffs on $120 billion of other goods to 7.5%. It kept in place 25% tariffs on $250 billion of other Chinese goods.
BEARING THE COST
U.S. companies have paid $46 billion in tariffs since Trump began restructuring relationships with nearly all of Washington's major trading partners, U.S. data showed.
Trump insists the tariffs are paid by the countries against which they are levied, but U.S. economists and businesses say they bear the brunt of the costs.
Americans for Free Trade, a coalition of more than 150 business associations that oppose tariffs, said the Phase 1 trade deal would do little to alleviate the burden of billions of dollars in tariffs being paid by U.S. businesses.

""The vast majority of the tariffs – which are taxes paid by Americans and not China – will remain in place, continuing to damage the American economy,"" said spokesman Jonathan Gold.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 07:18PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC commissioner backs direct listings to rein in Wall Street fees,"By Katanga Johnson and Joshua Franklin
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Rob Jackson told Reuters on Tuesday that he supports so-called direct listings as a way to help bring down the excessive fees companies pay to Wall Street banks in order to go public.
His comments come as staff at the SEC, the top U.S. securities regulator, weigh a proposal by the New York Stock Exchange for a rule change that would allow more companies to go public without using banks to underwrite the transaction.
Jackson, a Democratic commissioner who was a capital markets banker early in his career, said he could not comment on the NYSE's specific proposal but that he generally welcomed innovations that could reduce the 7% fee companies raising less than $1 billion typically pay to Wall Street banks to go public. 
That fee, which has remained unchanged for two decades according to research conducted by Jackson's office, is a major obstacle for middle-market companies looking to list, he said. 
""In the modern world we live in, where everything costs less, it is astonishing that we charge a 7% tax to give people access to the public capital markets of the United States,"" Jackson said. He also rejected the claim frequently made by corporate lobbyists that red tape is the main reason the number of public companies has declined over the past 20 years.
""The good news is I think people are starting to compete, and direct listings is the beginning of what I hope will be a lot of innovation in the space,"" Jackson said.
In 2018, music streaming business Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology SA launched a direct listing, followed in 2019 by communication platform Slack Technologies Inc. Both had successful market debuts, but their share prices have since struggled.
One advantage of the direct listings is that the companies paid less in fees to Wall Street banks than in a traditional IPO. Critics, though, worry that direct listings could weaken investor protections, since banks also act as gatekeepers helping to spot fraudulent would-be issuers.
Jackson, who has established himself as a vocal advocate for investor rights during his two years at the SEC, acknowledged that ""trade off"" and said he would want to see details on how any direct listing rule change would protect investors.

""What we'll need is a solution that's robust and protects investors,"" he said.

The quakes included one with a magnitude of 6.4 on Jan. 7, the Caribbean island's most powerful earthquake in 102 years. Governor Wanda Vazquez estimated damages at $110 million and has requested a major disaster declaration from President Donald Trump.
Moody's said the earthquakes highlight ""significant environmental risks"" facing Puerto Rico, which has been in federal court since 2017 attempting to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligation through a form of municipal bankruptcy.
""Damage from the quakes is likely to blunt a recent trend of positive economic activity and increase the risk of more residents and corporations looking to relocate,"" the credit rating agency said in a report. 
The positive trend includes growth in population, employment and real economic output last year, according to the report.
An increase in the types and frequency of natural disasters on the island could make it harder to attract or expand operations by corporations, Moody's said. Compounding that problem is an expected phasing out by the U.S. Treasury of a business tax credit for American corporations based there, it added.
Puerto Rico is still struggling to recover from devastating hurricanes in 2017 and Moody's noted the island has received only a fraction of the federal funding allocated in the wake of that disaster.

A planned $1.26 billion refunding this week of outstanding debt was increased to $1.47 billion to accommodate $374 million of bonds Chicago expects to repurchase from investors as a result of the city's first tender offer, according to the announcement.
Savings from a bond refunding was the biggest piece of Mayor Lori Lighfoot's plan to tackle an $838 million deficit in Chicago's fiscal 2020 budget. The city now expects to add $40 million to a previously estimated $210 million in one-time savings.
A chronic budget deficit and big unfunded pension liability have weighed on credit ratings for the nation's third-largest city, leading to high borrowing costs.
""Building on the passage of the 2020 city budget, the tender is another example of many steps taken by the Lightfoot administration to reduce costs and find efficiencies to address our fiscal challenges,"" a statement from the mayor's office said.
Howard Cure, Evercore's managing director of municipal bond research, said the refunding should attract ""pretty high"" demand from investors looking for yield.
But he added that the city's plan to alleviate budget pressures by capitalizing the interest ""is not good debt practice.""
Starting on Wednesday, Chicago will refund tax-exempt and taxable general obligation (GO), motor fuel tax revenue, and infrastructure trust debt through a team of underwriters. Most of the refunding will flow through the city's Sales Tax Securitization Corporation as new second lien bonds.
Previous senior lien bonds issued through the corporation, which was created under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, earned higher credit ratings by giving investors a statutory lien on the city's share of state sales taxes.
S&P Global Ratings has assigned an AA-minus rating to the second lien bonds, which is several notches higher than the BBB-plus rating it gave to GO bonds the city is refunding outside of the corporation.
The tender offer, which was launched on Dec. 23, targeted $1.8 billion of outstanding Chicago GO bonds."

2. Beige Book, Wholesale Inflation Data Arrive
The Federal Reserve will issue its Beige Book of economic activity tomorrow, with the market looking very satisfied with conditions at the moment and expecting the Fed to keep rates at current levels.
The Beige Book comes out at 2 PM ET (19:00 GMT).
Kansas City Fed President Esther George said today keeping rates on hold is appropriate “as we assess the economy's response to last year's rate cuts and monitor incoming data.”
The consumer price index out today showed little retail inflation pressure and investors will see if there are any red flags on the wholesale side tomorrow.
The Labor Department issues the December producer price index (PPI) tomorrow at 8:30 AM ET.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks dipped on Tuesday, reversing earlier intraday record highs, following a report that the United States would likely maintain tariffs on Chinese goods until after November's presidential election.
The eventual removal of tariffs by Washington would depend on Beijing's compliance with the Phase 1 trade accord, which is expected to be signed on Wednesday, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.
With the S&P 500 at record levels, equivalent to around 18 times expected earnings, algorithmic traders and human investors interpreted the Bloomberg report as a reason to sell, said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of Themis Trading, in Chatham, New Jersey.
""We're in a Jason Bourne market. The first thing Jason Bourne does when he walks into a room is look for the exit, just in case,"" Saluzzi said, comparing investor sentiment to the fictional action character. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq each touched intraday record highs before losing ground in afternoon trade. The Dow ended the session with a modest gain. 
Wall Street has surged in recent weeks, fueled by optimism that a truce in U.S. President Trump's trade war with China would boost corporate earnings. 
China has pledged to buy nearly an additional $80 billion of manufactured goods from the United States over the next two years, and over $50 billion more in energy supplies, Reuters reported, citing a source briefed on the Phase 1 trade deal.
Kicking off the fourth-quarter earnings season, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) rose 1.2% after reporting a better-than-expected profit on strength in its trading and underwriting businesses.
 Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) tumbled 5.4% after reporting a slump in profit as it set aside $1.5 billion for legal expenses.  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) rose 1.6% as it topped Wall Street profit estimates.
""It (bank earnings) is reflective of where we are in the economic cycle,"" said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*TRADE Financial Corp.
""We're coming off a decade of consistent gains and banks, especially JPMorgan producing record earnings, it's not surprising given the strength of the U.S. economy.""
Analysts expect profits at S&P 500 companies to drop 0.5% for the second consecutive quarter, according to Refinitiv IBES data, largely due to a drag in energy and industrial earnings that have been hit by the prolonged Sino-U.S. trade war.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) ended up 0.11% at 28,939.67 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.15% to 3,283.15.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 0.24% to 9,251.33.
FedEx (N:FDX) rallied 1.8% after CNBC reported that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had lifted a ban on its sellers using the company for ground deliveries.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 eased from record highs on Tuesday as sentiment on trade was knocked by a report the U.S. will keep tariffs on Chinese goods through the 2020 U.S. election in November.
The S&P 500 lost 0.15%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.24% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.11%.
Existing tariffs on imported Chinese goods are likely to remain in place until after the U.S. election, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter said.
Washington will review Beijing's compliance with the trade agreement no sooner than 10 months after the signing of the phase one agreement on Wednesday, according to the report.
The decision to keep the tariffs in place would allow the White House to reimpose levies if it determines that Beijing has not lived up to its end of the agreement.
Sentiment on trade soured somewhat forcing stocks to give up their earnings-infused gains following mostly bullish reports from major Wall Street banks.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) ended the day 1% higher as both banks beat earnings estimates from Investing.com thanks to a rebound in fourth-quarter trading activity.
  Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC), however, slipped 5% after its earnings fell short of estimates.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) surged 3% after delivering blowout earnings, underpinned by lower fuel prices and higher demand for travel.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) rose 0.6% despite posting the lowest orders in 30 years as the grounding of its 737 Max continued to weigh on performance.
Following a recent streak of gains, tech ended the day in the red, led by weakness in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dawn of the new decade has brought a reprieve for debt-laden companies in the energy sector: Investors are throwing money their way again, for now. 
Having been largely shut out of capital markets in 2019, low-rated energy firms, some on the brink of default, are racing to secure financing. They are finding willing lenders. 
Indeed, the first two weeks of the year have brought as many energy junk bond sales as in the last half of 2019, according to data from Dealogic, a data analytics firm. 
In addition, total return in the oil and gas sector is broadly outperforming the wider high-yield debt market after getting walloped last year. 
This new wave of deals may keep distressed companies alive for now, but it could ultimately prolong and worsen the pain. 
The fundamental story in the sector has not changed - companies are highly leveraged, the oil market is amply supplied and prices are not seen rising all that much despite the recent bump from the heightened tensions between the United States and Iran.
""We'll see how long this window lasts, but I think everybody is trying to take advantage,"" said Sreedhar Kona, senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service. 
Of the $14.9 billion in high-yield deals to price in 2020 so far, $9.45 billion - roughly two-thirds - came from energy companies, according to Refinitiv's Eikon.
The spark appears to have come from one of the weakest credits in the sector. In early December, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), battling to stave off bankruptcy, secured a $1.5 billion loan after repeated failed attempts. 
Since then, the ICE/BofAML U.S. junk-rated energy index, which tracks the value of U.S. high-yield energy bonds, has risen nearly 7%, more than double the total return of the wider non-investment grade market. Energy credit spreads - a measure of the compensation demanded by investors for the added risk of holding those bonds rather than safer U.S. Treasuries - have narrowed by the most since 2016, when the sector was recovering from a collapse in oil prices.

""In December we were starting to see one or two companies show that access to the market is possible, although it may need to come with strings like secured financing as opposed to unsecured or covenants that were more stringent than in the past,"" said Sonali Pier, portfolio manager at PIMCO.
January's rush to market was also aided by a brief rise in oil prices on the escalation of Middle East tensions after the Trump administration killed a top Iranian military official. Brent crude futures rose above $70 a barrel but have since given back all those gains and then some.
The newly revived markets will be a lifeline in particular for companies on the hook for some of the $55 billion of energy debt maturing in the next three years, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Most of January's junk energy issuance has been for refinancing purposes, including a $750 million deal from midstream servicer Genesis Energy and a $550 million deal for natural gas producer Range Resources (NYSE:RRC).
Demand has also been robust enough to support a $750 million offering from offshore driller Transocean rated by Moody's at Caa1, the lowest category of junk.
The market may provide a chance for companies like oil transport firm Hornbeck Offshore to refinance some of the $674 million it has maturing in the coming two years, $224 million of which comes due on April 1. Hornbeck has been trying to complete a deal for the past two years, according to Kona.
""If companies with maturities inside three years can access the market, that really does change the liquidity profile, which is what's in question today,"" said PIMCO'S Pier. 
The oil and gas industry depends on access to capital markets to finance its growth. With urgent needs to refinance and service existing debt, firms may not also be able to raise the cash needed to invest in new projects.
Even if they do, expectations for sustained higher oil prices in 2020, and therefore cash flow in the sector, are low. A Reuters poll in late December forecast U.S. crude prices averaging $60 a barrel or more only in 2023. They were at $58.20 on Tuesday.
The more stringent terms companies have had to accept to get deals done may come back to bite. 
For example, Western Midstream, rated junk by Moody's and one notch above junk by S&P, secured competitive pricing for its $3.5 billion offering only by adding a provision that gives investors an additional 25 basis points on their coupon for every ratings downgrade. It is a risky bet: while the company's outlook may be developing, the sector's is not.

In a discussion with journalists, Mattar added that the sale of the country's post office would most likely occur toward the end of 2021, as the government is still analyzing its options.
Under President Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's government has been seeking to reduce its corporate footprint to slim down, combat corruption and generate cash.
In 2019, the government raised 51.4 billion reais with privatizations and 54 billion reais through the sale of shares held by public-sector institutions.
Bolsonaro's economic team plans to reduce the number of companies in which it has a controlling or minority stake to around 300, down from 624 at the end of 2019, Mattar said.
""We intend to sell 150 billion reais in government assets, being about 300 companies, and we are currently working on a nearly ready fast track that studies the correct time to enter Congress,"" said Mattar.
He added that his team hopes to pass a bill aimed at accelerating congressional approvals for divestments. ""The goal depends on the fast track passing,"" said Mattar."

(Reuters) - Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co said on Tuesday it plans to sell two versions of insulin products at half their current U.S. list prices, eight months after it started selling a half-priced version of its widely-used Humalog injection.
Lilly will sell new versions of Humalog Junior KwikPen and Humalog Mix75/25, which contains a mix of fast- and intermediate-acting insulin, at a list price of $265.20 for a pack of five KwikPens. They will be available at that price by mid-April, the company said.
Major insulin makers Lilly, Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA and  Novo Nordisk  (CSE:NOVOb) have been making some of their life-sustaining diabetes medicine available at lower costs to counter heavy criticism from lawmakers and patients.
People with Type 1 diabetes need insulin to control blood sugar levels, and it is also used by some with advanced Type 2 diabetes as well. Its cost in the United States nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, and stories have emerged of patients forced into risky rationing of the medicine.
Lilly has said insulin is highly rebated, meaning that list price does not reflect the actual cost. Drugmakers argue they have to keep list prices high because of rebates or discounts they must pay to pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers to get products on their lists of covered drugs.
""Insurance coverage should ensure no one with diabetes is forced to ration or skip doses for financial reasons,"" Lilly diabetes head Mike Mason said in a statement on Tuesday.
T1International, which represents people with Type 1 diabetes, said Lilly's half-price insulin has been difficult to obtain and said the latest move ""may be nothing more than a further PR response to continued pressure from advocates.""
""The two pen types that were added to Lilly's half-price offerings today will undoubtedly lead to positive headlines for Lilly, but these pens are not widely used in the type 1 diabetes community and will do little good for patients if they are unable to obtain them,"" the group's U.S. advocacy manager, Allison Bailey, said in an email.
Lilly in May started selling a half-priced version of Humalog called Insulin Lispro.
For the week of Dec. 30, around 22% of U.S. prescriptions for Humalog were filled with the company's half-priced version, according to data compiled by retail drug price tracker GoodRx from sources including pharmacies and insurers.
Novo Nordisk said earlier this month it would offer free insulin to U.S. patients in immediate need, following its September announcement that U.S. patients can buy three vials or two packs of pens of its analog insulins for $99.
In April, a U.S. congressional committee called on executives from Novo, Sanofi and Lilly to testify about rising insulin costs."
411,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 03:53PM ET</span>",Fed Announces Plans For Repo Operations Through to Mid-February,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Tuesday announced plans to conduct repurchase agreement operations through until at least Feb. 13, although the size of term operations will be trimmed to $30 billion from the start of next month. The central bank did not elaborate on plans beyond that.
The move extends a program that has been in place since it stepped in to combat funding-market turmoil in September, but indicates the central bank may have one eye on the exit.
It announced plans to conduct a series of term repo operations from Jan. 16 through Jan. 30 of $35 billion apiece, in line with the most recent similar actions. Those scheduled from Feb. 4 to Feb. 13 will have a maximum offering size of $30 billion. The newly scheduled operations will provide liquidity through to Feb. 27. The maximum size of the central bank’s daily overnight operations, meanwhile, will be kept steady at $120 billion. These are slated to continue until Feb. 13, according to the New York Fed.
“This is consistent with our assumption that the Fed will back off slowly and make sure not to rock the funding boat,” said BMO rate strategist Jon Hill.
The Fed has been conducting repo offerings and Treasury-bill purchases in a bid to keep control of short-term interest rates and bolster bank reserves. That has calmed markets since the September spike that took overnight repo rates as high as 10% and helped to quell concerns about a potential cash crunch at the end of December 2019.
In the minutes from December Federal Open Market Committee released last week, Lorie Logan, manager, of the System Open Market Account, said January’s calendar could reflect a “gradual reduction” in offerings, though indicated that some repos might be needed at least through April, when tax payments will reduce reserve levels.
The Fed also announced Tuesday that it planned to keep the pace of Treasury purchases it conducts unchanged. The central bank will buy $60 billion a month of Treasury bills for reserve management and $20 billion a month of Treasuries of various types for reinvestment purchases, according to the New York branch’s website.

412,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>",U.S. Seeks Biggest Change to Economic-Data Releases in Decades,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration plans to restrict the news media’s ability to prepare advance stories on market-moving economic data, according to people familiar with the matter, in a move that could create a logjam in accessing figures such as the monthly jobs report.
Currently, the Labor Department in Washington hosts “lockups” for major reports lasting 30 to 60 minutes, where journalists receive the data in a secure room, write stories on computers disconnected from the internet, and transmit them when connections are restored at the release time.
The department is looking at changes such as removal of computers from that room, and an announcement could come as soon as this week, said the people, who spoke on condition they not be identified. That could hinder the media’s ability to provide headlines, comprehensive stories and tables at the exact release time.
The move would upend decades of practice, and media organizations including Bloomberg News and Reuters have challenged prior changes to procedures. The shift could also spur an arms race among high-speed traders to get the numbers first and profit off the data, raising questions about fairness in multitrillion-dollar financial markets.
Michael Trupo, a spokesman for the Labor Department, didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. The Commerce Department -- which provides advance access to its reports such as gross domestic product and retail sales at the Labor-hosted lockups -- referred questions on the matter to Labor.
Without news services transmitting their reports at the release time and allowing additional access points, the government may have to prepare its websites to handle potentially heavier loads under the new system, which could mean adding security measures or increasing the traffic capacity.
Previous Plan
In 2012, the Labor Department under the Obama administration sought to alter lockups to require journalists to use government-owned computers to write their stories. Officials at the time framed the change as addressing security risks.
After protests from Bloomberg News and other news organizations, and a congressional hearing in which editors testified, the department agreed to allow the media to continue using their own equipment and data lines. Reporters are required to leave mobile phones and other electronic devices in lockers outside of the lockup room, along with personal effects such as umbrellas and purses.
The Labor Department move would follow a similar decision by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2018 to scale back lockups covering farm products, particularly the closely-watched monthly crop forecasts that typically move markets in soybeans, corn and wheat."
413,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 03:01PM ET</span>","Air Force agents raid military landlord's Oklahoma office, seize computers","By M.B. Pell
(Reuters) - Air Force investigators raided the Oklahoma City offices of a major military landlord Tuesday morning, seizing computers and other material, in what the company said was part of an investigation into asbestos contamination.
The landlord, Balfour Beatty Communities, has been the focus of Reuters reports describing how it falsified maintenance records at several bases, allowing the company to collect millions in incentive bonus payments while military families awaited repairs. One of the bases Reuters described was Tinker Air Force in Oklahoma, the subject of Tuesday's raid.
Linda Card, chief of public affairs for the Air Office of Special Investigations, confirmed the raid took place in cooperation with other federal agencies, but said she had no further details to share.
In a statement, Balfour Beatty said the federal action was related to a subpoena issued by the Environmental Protection Agency.
""The investigation is connected to the matter of asbestos flooring removal that was reported in September 2019. When that event occurred, BBC promptly and voluntarily reported the incident to the local Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality,"" it said. ""The company will continue to cooperate fully with the investigation.”
At Tinker, Reuters in June documented how one family was left for months with deteriorating asbestos flooring even as Balfour Beatty's maintenance records said, incorrectly, that the problem had been quickly fixed.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations have been investigating allegations of fraud at Tinker and two other Air Force bases where the company is landlord, John Henderson, the Air Force assistant secretary for installations, told Reuters last year. They are Travis in California and Fairchild in Washington State. Air Force agents are investigating additional fraud allegations at Mountain Home in Idaho and Lackland in Texas.
Balfour Beatty said it has hired an outside lawyer and auditor to examine the allegations.
Balfour Beatty Communities, based in Malvern, Pennsylvania, runs the military housing unit of Balfour Beatty plc, a London-based infrastructure company with annual revenue of $10.7 billion. The company earns $33 million in annual profit on its military housing operations, Balfour Beatty Communities President Chris Williams (NYSE:WMB) told Congress in February. The company operates 43,000 housing units at 55 Army, Navy and Air Force bases across the United States."

415,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 02:23PM ET</span>",A Decade Without Fed Hikes Comes Into View for Bond Investors,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond managers are starting to contemplate the prospect of another decade without a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike.
Forecasting that far out may seem like a fool’s errand. But the central bank’s inability to push inflation sustainably above its 2% target, even after three 2019 rate cuts amid the strongest job market in 50 years, gives that outlook more weight, they said. The scenario rejects the notion that last year’s easing was a sort of insurance move that could be quickly reversed under an improving economy.
The last time the U.S. went close to a decade without a rate increase was 2006-2015, as the economy absorbed the financial crisis and recession. That turmoil helped propel Treasuries’ bull run, which last year delivered the best annual performance for U.S. government debt since 2011.
As a result, yields are within about a half-percentage point of record lows, and are approaching zero after factoring in the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation. That’s dimming Treasuries’ appeal for some. Investors may look to build more of their portfolios with emerging-market debt or agency, asset-backed and corporate debt, which offer extra yield above U.S. government securities.
“Yields are going to stay low for longer in the U.S., and the bar is very high for the Fed to tighten rates,” said Jack McIntyre at Philadelphia-based Brandywine Global Investment Management, which oversees $75 billion in mostly bonds. “Even if inflation trends higher, the Fed is going to be slow to respond to that in order to avoid having us going down the same path as Japan and Europe.”
McIntyre says he’s moved away from Treasuries over the past year, though he does like 30-year bonds. He’s been buying sovereign debt of Indonesia, Mexico, Malaysia, Brazil and Colombia -- where 10-year yields can be around 3% or higher. He sees an opportunity for price appreciation in those assets, something he expects will be scarcer in developed markets.
McIntyre helps manage Brandywine’s $2.9 billion Global Opportunities Bond Fund, which trailed most of its peers with a 6.9% return during the past year. He says the fund lagged amid a strong dollar, but could do better should the greenback weaken and provide a tailwind.
The U.S. and global economies will avoid a downturn over the next three years due to monetary and fiscal-stimulus worldwide, in his view. But he says growth won’t be enough to boost domestic inflation consistently above 2% or to get the Fed to hike anytime through 2028. The last increase was in December 2018. Long-term, inflation will be capped by demographics, technology and globalization, similar to how these forces have impacted Japan and Europe, he says.
He expects U.S. yields to be largely range-bound, with the 10-year around 1.5% to 2.5% over the next three to five years in his base-case scenario of no recession. However, a downturn would put a 1% yield on the 10-year “clearly into play,” he said. That would take it below the record low of 1.32%, set in 2016. It’s about 1.8% now.
This outlook on rates is far from universal: Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). are among firms anticipating a Fed hike in the next two years, though the median expectation in a Bloomberg survey is for no change. The consensus for U.S. yields is for a steady, albeit modest, drift higher, even if inflation isn’t expected to budge much above 2%.
Traders see the Fed’s next move as a cut, potentially by the end of 2020. Fed officials, for their part, are signaling policy is likely to be on hold.
Western Asset Management Co. agrees that the Fed’s 2019 rate cuts are unlikely to be undone soon, though its forecasts don’t go as far out as 2028, says portfolio manager Julien Scholnick.
The firm, which manages $453 billion in mostly fixed income, is positioning for a Fed that stays on hold even if the economy improves and inflation drifts up to 2% -- by taking a “barbell approach” favoring 2-, 5- and 30-year Treasuries for now.
Those maturities should see limited sell-offs with front-end yields pinned around current levels during the Fed’s pause at a 1.50%-1.75% fed funds rate target, even if growth accelerates, Scholnick said. And he sees little catalyst for long-dated yields to climb absent meaningful inflation.
Scholnick helps manage the $31 billion Western Asset Core Plus Bond Fund, which returned 11.7% in the past year, outpacing most competitors.
For Western Asset, in Pasadena, California, a U.S. recession isn’t the most likely outcome, although the median forecast in the latest Bloomberg survey has one starting in 2021. But Scholnick says a decade without a Fed hike can’t be ruled out if a downturn hits.
“We’re in a low-growth and low-inflation environment not only here but on a global basis, and we don’t think Fed officials are going to be reversing what they’ve done with rate cuts over the next year,” he said."

The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial indexes all pulled back from records as the conditions underscored lingering concern about future progress in negotiations. Treasuries climbed earlier after a gauge of underlying inflation rose less than forecast.
“There was a lot of optimism built up and now this just throws a whole new wrench into that optimism and a lot of questions moving forward,” said Ryan Nauman, a market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence’s Zephyr.
The two sides have an understanding that no sooner than 10 months after the signing of the agreement at the White House Wednesday, the U.S. will review progress and potentially trim tariffs now in place on $360 billion of imports from China, according to people familiar with the matter said.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index closed higher, while earlier in Asia, stocks were slightly higher.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 01:48PM ET</span>",Boeing net orders slump to lowest in decades,"(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) reported its worst annual net orders in decades on Tuesday, along with its lowest numbers for plane deliveries in 11 years, as the grounding of its 737 MAX jet saw it fall far behind main competitor Airbus (PA:AIR).
Boeing's gross orders plunged 77% to 246 in 2019, while net orders after cancellations or conversions were just 54 airplanes compared with 893 the previous year.
After an accounting adjustment representing jets ordered in previous years but are now unlikely to be delivered, Boeing said its net total for orders this year sank to a negative 87 airplanes.
As a result, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio, which measures orders against deliveries, came in at a negative 0.23 in 2019.
Boeing said unidentified customers canceled orders for three 787-9s in December and another customer canceled an order for a 787-8.
Ten months after the MAX was grounded in March following two fatal crashes, Boeing still has a backlog of more than 5,400 orders for its long- and short-distance commercial jets.
By comparison, Airbus said earlier this month it racked up a net 768 orders last year after cancellations and delivered a record 863 planes.
The aviation industry is seeing a slowdown in orders, as fears of an economic downturn linger and global economies slow amid an ongoing U.S.-China trade war.
(Graphic: Boeing loses its crown to Airbus png click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/BOEING-DELIVERIES/0H001QXW2BE3/eikon.png)
Boeing said on Tuesday deliveries fell by 53% to 380 planes over the whole of last year, as the MAX's grounding made it impossible for it to deliver the planes to customers, forcing it to halt production last month and lose the top spot to its European rival for the first time in eight years.
Planemakers receive most of their revenue when aircraft are delivered - minus accumulated progress payments - making final delivery crucial for their finances.
Analysts estimate that Boeing has been losing around $1 billion a month because of the grounding and it reported an almost $3 billion negative free cash flow in the third quarter. Fourth-quarter figures are due on Jan. 29.
Boeing parted ways with Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg last month as it became increasingly clear that he was making little headway in resolving the crisis.

The company is still working to fix the MAX and there is little clarity on when Boeing is likely to get the green light from regulators to bring the airplane back into service, making analysts and investors jittery about the company's prospects in 2020.

Investing.com – Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) may not draw the level of fanfare as its more illustrious social media peers like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), but the online scrapbook company surged on Tuesday as data showed it has surpassed Snapchat as the third-biggest social media platform.
Pinterest saw 9.1% growth last year to 82.4 million users, surpassing Snapchat's 80.2 million users, according to data from eMarketer data.
Pinterest stock surged 10%
Snapchat ceded position to Pinterest despite seeing a rebound in user growth last year in the wake of the successful launch of an Android app and new virtual reality filters.
“While Snapchat has a young core audience that it caters to, Pinterest has a more universal appeal, and it's made significant gains in a wide range of age groups,” eMarketer junior forecasting analyst Nazmul Islam said.
The trend will likely continue into the future, eMarketer suggested, estimating Pinterest to rack up 90.1 million users by 2022, above Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) 86.1 million.
Advertisers are beginning to take taking notice.
Pinterest grew year-on-year sales 47% in the third quarter last year, above Facebook’s 28% ad sales growth and Google's 17%. But the online scrapbook company has yet to turn a profit.
For 2019, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) expects to report an adjusted loss in the range of $10 million and $30 million. It reported a third-quarter net loss of $124.7 million."

423,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo's new chief pledges more cost cuts as profit slumps,"By Imani Moise and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co's (N:WFC) profit slumped 55% in the fourth quarter as new boss Charles Scharf set aside another $1.5 billion for legal costs related to the bank's sales scandal and promised ""fundamental changes.""
The bank racked up operational losses of $1.9 billion in the final quarter of the year, partly for reserves to cover pending litigation related to its fake-account scandal that erupted more than three years ago.
Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. lender by assets, has leaned on cost cuts to stabilize its bottom line while its revenue growth has been sluggish. However, a raft of fines and costs relating to sales abuses first uncovered in 2016 have been hard to control.
Scharf said the bank's cost structure is simply too high, and pledged to improve performance once he gets through regulatory issues that need attention.
""There is no reason why we shouldn't have best-in-class efficiency with these businesses at this scale, and that ultimately will be our goal,"" the new chief executive said on a call with analysts.
He declined to give specific targets or a time frame for reaching them.
Wells Fargo shares fell about 4% to $50.01.
Cost-cutting was also a cornerstone of former CEO Tim Sloan's recovery plan, but the bank acknowledged last year that technology and compliance costs would remain high as it tried to satisfy regulators.
Wells Fargo's non-interest expenses jumped 17% in the fourth quarter compared with the year-earlier period, due to the litigation costs, as well as higher compensation expenses.
It spent 78.6 cents for every dollar of revenue it generated, up from 63.6 cents a year earlier, and far above Sloan's targeted range of 55-59 cents per dollar, or rival JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) 55.9 cents.
Investors watch that ratio closely to determine how well a company manages expenses.
Wells is operating under heavy scrutiny as it tries to rebuild its reputation, including an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve and frequent criticism from prominent U.S. politicians.
Its problems began to unfold in September 2016, when the bank revealed that employees had opened potentially millions of bogus accounts in customers' names without their permission to hit sales targets set by management. Since then, Wells Fargo has found other problematic practices that cost customers money or otherwise harmed their financial well-being.
Scharf is the fourth CEO in place since that time, and investors are hopeful he can finally get his arms around the problems.
Although the bank has reached settlements with some regulators and private parties, there are still outstanding probes by U.S. authorities, including the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. It also operates under consent orders with regulators, as well as the Fed's asset cap.
Scharf would not provide guidance on when Wells Fargo might resolve its regulatory issues.
Wells Fargo's profit fell to $2.55 billion, or 60 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $5.71 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier.
Its adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share compared with analyst estimates of $1.12, on average, according to Refinitiv. Revenue of $19.86 billion came in below expectations of $20.12 billion.
The bank's net interest income fell 11% as the Fed lowered interest rates three times last year to support the economy.
However, its mortgage business benefited from lower rates, with income rising to $783 million from $467 million.

Wells Fargo also continued to add deposits in the most recent quarter, with interest expense linked to deposits jumping 17%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will meet on Feb. 25 to determine the probable cause of the 2018 fatal crash of a Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) vehicle in Mountain View, California, the agency said.
The board will hold a hearing on the 2017 Tesla Model X crash that killed the its driver, 38-year-old Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineer Walter Huang, who was using the vehicle's advanced driver assistance system known as Autopilot.
The NTSB and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are investigating a number of crashes in which Autopilot is believed to have been in use.
The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system's ability to detect hazards, especially stationary objects. There are mounting safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.
NTSB makes safety recommendations but cannot compel action, while NHTSA can order a recall if it deems a vehicle poses an unreasonable safety risk.
Last week, NHTSA said it was launching an investigation into the Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla (O:TSLA) Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana. 
That crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA's special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects Autopilot or another advanced driver assistance system was in use. It is the third Tesla crash NHTSA has said it was investigating in recent weeks.
Autopilot had been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016, including the 2018 Mountain View crash. Tesla did not immediately comment.
NHTSA is also probing another Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Model S Tesla in Gardena, California. In that incident, the vehicle exited a freeway, ran a red light, and struck a 2006 Honda Civic, killing its two occupants.
The NTSB has criticized Autopilot's lack of safeguards. It said in September that its probe of a 2018 Culver City, California, Tesla crash found the system's design ""permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task.""
Tesla and NHTSA both advise drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot. Tesla says Autopilot ""enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane,"" but does not make the vehicle autonomous.
Some drivers say they are able to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods when using the system.

The benchmark S&P 500 fluctuated with declines in technology and energy shares offsetting increases in financials and industrials. Gains in JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Corp. pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average into the green. Treasuries climbed after a gauge of underlying inflation rose less than forecast.
“We’re seeing a mixed bag of results from big banks to start earnings season,” said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial. “There is a lot to live up to this earnings season since Q3 was so robust.”
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was set to close higher, while earlier in Asia, stocks were slightly higher.
The Chinese yuan held most of its surge from Monday, when Washington lifted its designation of the country as a currency cheat. The dollar held its gains after the inflation data, while the pound flirted with a possible sixth day of declines, which would be the longest losing streak since May.
Investors are catching their breath after a surge in optimism ahead of the signing of the first-phase trade deal between the world’s biggest economies.
“The next step is really whether the two countries adhere to the trade agreement and what the details of that trade agreement are,” Laura Foll, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, told Bloomberg TV. “And following on from that, how phase two of the negotiations go.”

American, the largest U.S. airline, announced last month it was canceling about 140 flights a day through April 6.
Once the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gives 737 MAX approval to return to service, American will need at least 30 days to prepare the jets and its pilots for commercial flights, airline and union officials have said. 
Boeing 737 MAXs have been grounded worldwide since March 2019 following an Ethiopian Airlines Co crash, the second of two fatal crashes in five months that killed 346 people.
Reuters has reported the FAA will not approve the return of the MAX until February and it could slip until March or later. Last week, Boeing said it would recommend requiring all pilots to undergo simulator training before resuming flights, which may also push back the resumption of commercial flights.
Last month, United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) extended cancellations of its MAX flights from March until June 4.
Without the 737 MAX, United said it was cancelling about 56 flights a day in January and February, which tend to be slower travel months, with daily cancellations rising to 80 in March and April and 108 in May and the early part of June.
Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), the largest operator of MAX airplanes worldwide, said in December it was removing roughly 300 weekday flights from its total peak-day schedule of more than 4,000 daily flights through April 13, nearly double the amount it had canceled through March 6.

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) posted its biggest-ever annual profit on Tuesday as its bond trading business bounced back in the last three months of the year, setting an upbeat tone for the big U.S. banks reporting this week.
Revenue rose at all but one of JPMorgan's four main businesses, beating analysts expectations and sending the bank's shares 2.2% higher. Executives were positive and clear-eyed about the outlook for 2020, as well. 
""Our outlook heading into 2020 is constructive, underpinned by the strength of the U.S. consumer,"" said JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak on a call with analysts. ""In spite expected slower global growth and the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, we remain well-positioned.""

At JPMorgan, the only business to post a decline was commercial banking, which reported revenues fell 3% on lower net interest income and higher expenses due to investments in the business.The bank's bond trading revenue jumped 86% compared to a year earlier when financial markets were walloped industry-wide by a sell-off driven by trade and global growth concerns. Revenue from equity markets rose 15% to $1.5 billion.
Piepszak conceded that its returns in bond-trading benefited from ""a favorable comparison against a challenging fourth quarter last year,"" but said there were examples of strength across the business. 
Debt underwriting fees in the investment bank rose 11 percent year over year, in part thanks to the increased activity in bond issuance which made for competitive pricing conditions, she said.
Overall revenue at JPMorgan's corporate and investment banking unit, which houses its trading and underwriting businesses, surged 31% to $9.47 billion.
The consumer and community banking business, which accounts for almost half of the bank's revenues, reported a $14 billion, or 3% rise, over last year. 
Chase credit card customers used their plastic to the bank's benefit this holiday season. The bank reported credit card, merchant services and auto revenue surged $6.3 billion or 9%, with credit card loans up 8%. 
But revenues were under pressure this quarter from lower deposit margins because low interest rates meant that the bank earned less on deposits it loaned out. Home lending revenue was also down 5% to $1.3 billion.
Total loans, excluding home lending, rose 3% in the quarter. Home loans were down 17%.
Deposits flowed into the consumer bank in the fourth quarter, helping to offset a decline in loans, as Chase opened around 100 new bank branches 2019 in many new cities where it previously had not been located. Deposits grew 5% compared to a year ago.

""There's no question that we're picking up new customers, but that's not the main driver of our performance,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian told Reuters, citing a strong brand and customer loyalty at a time when air travel demand continues to rise.
Demand is rising at a time when the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX is keeping much-needed capacity off the U.S. market, enabling airlines to charge higher fares. Delta profits from that more than most because it has no 737 MAX aircraft.

Delta wants to remain a customer of both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) but Bastian said the longer Boeing takes to decide on the NMA - its new midsize plane - the fewer options the airline has. Airbus' A321XLR and A330 could be alternatives to the new Boeing jet, he said.

Comparable sales were down 25%. The company also forecast a loss for the current fiscal year, when it reports at the end of March.
8:40 AM ET: Aecom Technology (NYSE:ACM) stock was up 4.1% at a new all-time high after a Bloomberg report saying that Canadian professional services company WSP Global had approached it about a deal.
8:32 AM ET:   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) stock was up 0.5% after its fourth-quarter revenue and earnings came in 3% ahead of expectations. The results were driven by a 49% rise in fixed-income trading revenue in the quarter. The bank’s global consumer division also posted an $8.5 billion increase in revenue.
8:27 AM ET: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock was down 0.1% after reports that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is seeking a court order to block it from working on a $10 billion Cloud computing contract from the Pentagon.
According to Reuters, who cited a court filing, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to file a motion for a temporary restraining order on Jan. 24 and a federal court will issue its decision on Feb. 11.
8:21 AM ET: Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) rose another 10.3%, extending a rally that has already seen it rise 50% since the end of last year.
There’s been no single catalyst for the increase, but a number of analysts have flagged what they see as an inevitable march toward mainstream status for plant-based meat alternatives in their outlooks for 2020.
The stock is still over 50% below where it peaked in the euphoria after its IPO last year.
8:17 AM ET: Visa (NYSE:V) stock was up 0.2%, on course for a fifth straight record high, after announcing the acquisition of fintech startup Plaid for $5.3 billion. The acquisition reflects the company’s efforts to ensure that its dominant position in global payments today isn’t eroded by new technologies that bypass cards.
8:10 AM ET: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock was 1.1% higher, coming back off earlier highs, after convincingly beating forecasts for fourth-quarter revenue and earnings. Earnings per share rose nearly 30% on the year, a comparison flattered by volatility in global markets at the end of 2018, but 8% annual growth in consumer loans showed the bank’s core business was still going strong.
  Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC) stock was down 2.8% after missing expectations on both top and bottom lines, as litigation-related expenses drove it to an operating loss. Income from the bank's core business also fell in the fourth quarter, while risk provisioning rose.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock was up 3.4% after strong demand for travel and lower fuel costs helped it to beat forecasts for fourth-quarter earnings per share by over 20%. The company has escaped disruption to its schedules by virtue of not having the grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX in its fleet. However, the midpoint of its earnings guidance range for 2020 - $7.25 a share – represents a slight drop from 2019’s $7.31."

438,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",Instacart to expand grocery pick-up service to all 50 states by end of 2020,"(Reuters) - Instacart plans to expand its grocery pick-up service to all 50 states of the U.S. by the end of this year, the company said on Tuesday, as it doubles down on an increasingly popular ""click and collect"" shopping habit among consumers.
""Click and collect"", a service offered by retailers where customers order goods online and pick them up at a nearby store, has had a boom in popularity over the last few years as shoppers see the appeal in avoiding shipping costs and waiting for deliveries.
""The growth and expansion of Instacart Pickup is being driven by the rapid customer adoption we're seeing for the product as well as the significant benefits that it offers our retail partners,"" the company said.
U.S. sales through ""click and collect"", for all companies that offer the service, rose 35% in November and December compared with a year earlier, outstripping a 13.1% increase in total online sales, according to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics.
As part of the expansion of the service, which is currently offered in 30 states across 50 grocers, Instacart said it will add new pick-up features to its shopping app and named company executive Sarah Mastrorocco as head of Instacart Pickup.
The expansion of the service also comes at a time when the company is facing increasing pressure from its freelance ""gig"" workers, who make home deliveries to customers, over inequalities in pay structures that they say are getting worse every year.
Workers who pack orders for the company's pick-up service are part-time employees of Instacart and are different from delivery workers, who are independent contractors.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global markets experienced a slight bout of weakness on Tuesday as traders cashed in on recent record highs, awaited a long-anticipated U.S.-China trade deal and began to digest the first Wall Street earnings of the new year. 
It was smooth sailing in Asia; MSCI's world stocks index set a new record high after reassuring Chinese data and Washington had said it no longer deemed Beijing a currency manipulator. But Europe's session saw the currents turn.
Dealers struggled to put their finger on the exact cause but London, Frankfurt and Paris all saw an early wobble which left the regional STOXX 600 (STOXX) down as 0.5%, and bonds and other safe-haven assets suddenly back in demand. [GVD/EUR]
""You had some good news in terms of China coming off the list of currency manipulators and so you would have expected bond prices to extend losses,"" said Andy Cossor, a rates strategist at DZ Bank in Frankfurt. 
""So, I think it might be a case that people got ahead of themselves yesterday and are covering short positions.""
Wall Street futures weren't look any brighter either. The S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq were all expected to open lower, though quarterly earnings from U.S. banks JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Citigroup  (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) were starting to be digested. (N)
A number of heavyweight emerging-market currencies were on the ropes too. The highly-sensitive South African rand hit a three-week low and Turkey's lira took its biggest tumble since mid-December as it dropped 0.4%. [EMRG/FRX] 
China's yuan also backed off, having hit its highest level since July overnight after the U.S. Treasury Department said it had removed the currency manipulator tag it had imposed on the country in August.
Beijing had done its part by fixing the yuan's official level at its firmest level in more than five months. It has also pledged to buy almost $80 billion more of U.S. manufactured goods over the next two years and more than $50 billion of energy supplies, according to a source briefed on the trade deal.
The moves coincided with the arrival of a Chinese delegation in Washington ahead of Wednesday's scheduled signing of the Phase 1 trade agreement, seen as calming a dispute that has upended the world economy.
""There have been a number of false starts,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics at Mizuho Bank in Singapore, of the expected deal signing.
""The fact that this is really coming to the moment when the rubber hits the road is the most tangible evidence of traction in starting to resolve issues."" 
In contrast to Europe's dip, Japan's Nikkei (N225) had added 0.7% overnight to hit its highest level in a month. Australian shares rose by the same margin to close at a record (AXJO) 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) and Shanghai blue chips (CSI300) also hit multi-month peaks before running out of steam.
NEW SEASON 
In reaction to the pull-back in risk appetite, gold climbed up off a two-week low although it was still around 0.2% weaker for the day at $1,543 per ounce. [GOL/]
Ten-year U.S. Treasury note yields (US10YT=RR), the benchmark for risk-adverse fixed income markets also rallied, dropping roughly three ticks to 1.835% compared with the 1.863% they had touched in Asia. 
In currency markets, the Japanese yen stabilised near 110 yen-per-dollar, while another safety play, the Swiss franc, hit its highest level against a lifeless euro since 2017 and rose 0.4% against the dollar. [/FRX]
In contrast to China, Washington slapped the currency manipulator tag on Switzerland on Monday. 
Besides the expected trade deal, investors are also looking to U.S. inflation data due at 1330 GMT, with consensus expectations for it to hold steady at 0.2% in December. 
At the beginning of the fourth-quarter U.S. company results season, JPMorgan posted what looked to be, at first reading, a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit, as strong results at its trading and underwriting businesses offset weakness in consumer banking. 
Consumer lending is expected to propel profits for big U.S. banks is the results this week, though stress in corporate lending and uneven capital markets may cast a shadow.

440,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Set for Losses Despite JPMorgan Beat,"
By Peter Nurse 

Investing.com - Wall Street is set to open lower Tuesday, as investors bank recent gains and look to the start of the earnings season with a degree of caution despite an impressive lead from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).

Futures for the S&P 500 were trading 2 points, or 0.1%, lower by 07:15 ET (12:15 GMT), futures for the NASDAQ were 11 points, or 0.1%, lower, while the DJI futures contract outperformed, up 4 points, or 0.1%.

This push back comes after the major U.S. equity indices posted new highs on Monday. The broad-based S&P 500 cash index gained 22.78 points, or 0.7%, to close at 3288.13, a new high. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite also ended the day at a record, climbing 95.07 points, or 1%, to 9273.93. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 83.28 points, or 0.3%, to close at 28,907.05, just 0.2% below last week’s record high.
All eyes now are on the start of the U.S. reporting season, starting today with banking giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) and   Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC). The banks are often taken as a rough proxy for the health of the broader economy, and are thus likely to set the tone of the overall earnings season. 

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) impressed with its fourth-quarter release, with earnings per share coming at $2.57, compared with $2.35 expected, and revenue was $29.21 billion, above the expected $27.96 billion. Its shares climbed 1.8% in premarket trading.
These banks have had to cope with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates three times last year. Lower rates reduce what banks can charge on loans, but they also cut what they have to pay for deposits.

Still, any market pullback is unlikely to be severe as global economic sentiment remains healthy. There was a boost to this overnight as the U.S. revoked its decision, taken last summer, to call China a currency manipulator - just days before the two countries are set to sign phase one of a trade deal.

This phase one deal would prevent any further tit-for-tat tariffs and roll back some existing U.S. tariffs in Chinese goods, although it would leave many others still in place and will also not address major concerns about China's treatment of intellectual property and its extensive subsidies for state-owned companies.

Elsewhere, crude oil bounced while gold futures lost ground as investors left the safe haven amid broadening optimism.
U.S. Crude Oil WTI Futures traded up 0.7% at $58.51 by 06:55 AM ET (11:55 GMT). International Brent Oil Futures also climbed 0.9% to $64.78. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX fell 0.4% to $1,544.05."

PARIS (Reuters) - Retailer Auchan [AUCHF.UL] said on Tuesday it planned to cut 517 jobs in France as part of efforts to reduce costs to cope with fierce competition from the likes of Amazon (O:AMZN) as well as changing shopping habits.
Unlisted Auchan Retail, the retail arm of the Auchan group, said the plan, which also includes a greater focus on e-commerce and local products, involves the voluntary departure of head office and support services staff in France. Auchan employs about 75,000 people in France. 
Auchan, like French rival  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), has suffered because of its heavy reliance on large hypermarket formats when customers have been shifting to shopping more locally and online.
""Volume retailing, born in the 60s and 70s to make the broadest offer accessible to the greatest number of people is now being shaken up by new entrants,"" Auchan said in a statement. The company said the advent of online as well as emphasis on healthy and sustainable eating had had an impact on the food retail business in general.
Rival Carrefour is already in the middle of a five-year plan to cut costs, boost e-commerce and accelerate expansion into convenience stores and locally sourced food. 
In August 2019, Auchan Retail said it aimed to achieve an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin of 6% by 2022 and for that it would need to seek additional savings of 1.1 billion euros.

U.S. online giant Amazon announced earlier this month it will create more than 500 jobs with the opening of a new fulfillment center in Senlis, north of Paris, in May 2020.

Here is a summary of European airlines that have gone bankrupt since 2017 (in chronological order):
AIR BERLIN
Germany's second-largest airline filed for bankruptcy on Aug. 15, 2017, after shareholder Etihad Airways withdrew funding following years of losses.
The German government granted a bridging loan of 150 million euros ($163.3 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany.
In October, Lufthansa agreed to buy parts of the insolvent company. [https://reut.rs/2llUI6P] [https://reut.rs/2lNYlCQ]
MONARCH
Britain's Monarch Airlines collapsed on Oct. 2, 2017, affecting around 900,000 passengers.
Hurt partly by a weakened pound, its finances deteriorated in 2016 after security concerns deterred travel to Tunisia, Turkey and Egypt and brought increased capacity on routes to Iberia.
The company, based at Luton Airport north of London, had been in business since 1968. [https://reut.rs/2nq1rgD]
PRIMERA AIR
The Danish airline ceased operations on Oct. 1, 2018. Forced to cancel flights earlier that year, citing delays in receiving aircraft from Airbus, it later faced complaints about poor service and late refunds. [https://reut.rs/2lmsRDx]
GERMANIA
Germany's Germania declared bankruptcy on Feb. 4, 2019, after it failed to secure financing to navigate a short-term cash squeeze. [https://reut.rs/2nvZUpp]
Founded in Berlin in 1986, it mainly flew German tourists to more than 60 destinations in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
FLYBMI
The UK regional airline ceased operation on Feb. 16, 2019, blaming Brexit uncertainty as one of the reason for its collapse.
It said its prospects had ""been seriously affected by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process, which has led to our inability to secure valuable flying contracts in Europe and a lack of confidence around bmi's ability to continue flying between destinations in Europe."" [https://reut.rs/2nwj0Md]
WOW AIR
Iceland's WOW air became another budget airline casualty on March 28, 2019, after failed efforts to raise funds, which included merger talks with rival Icelandair.
WOW controlled a quarter of the fast-growing low-cost, long-haul transatlantic market in 2018. The airline's collapse negatively affected Iceland's economy, which was largely dependent on tourism. [https://reut.rs/2CH1KZl] [https://reut.rs/2lT1b9v]
THOMAS COOK
The world’s oldest travel company, Thomas Cook, collapsed on Sept. 23, 2019, sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history, with about 600,000 people including 150,000 Britons abroad at the time of the collapse.
The company, which failed to secure a deal with creditors or a government bailout, ran hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million people a year. [https://reut.rs/2mUg5w8]
AIGLE AZUR
The French airline ceased all activities on Sep. 27, 2019, after a commercial court rejected financial rescue offers. Aigle Azur was put under bankruptcy protection on Sept. 2 and halted operations days later, leaving 19,000 passengers stranded. [https://reut.rs/2o2a812]
ADRIA AIRWAYS
Slovenian airline Adria Airways filed for bankruptcy and cancelled all flights on Sept. 30, 2019, after grounding most of its flights in the previous week.
Government officials have said European Union rules on state aid prevented the government helping Adria. They added it would also not have helped the company under its current ownership, which they called ""irresponsible"". [https://reut.rs/2nh5yvL]
XL Airways
French airline XL Airways was ordered on Oct. 4, 2019, to go into liquidation after a last-minute rescue bid was rejected by a French court. [https://reut.rs/2tgZiqG]
XL Airways operated four Airbus A330 aircraft and provided mainly long-haul flights to the Caribbean, the United States and France's Reunion island.
FLYBE
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Jan. 14 the government would do what it could to help struggling regional airline Flybe because of its importance for transport links.
The government could cut air passenger taxes on all domestic flights to help the airline following media reports that it urgently needed new funds to survive through the winter when demand for travel dips."
443,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>","Delta posts profit beat on loyal, new customers as rivals battle 737 MAX crisis","By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) posted on Tuesday a fourth-quarter profit that beat Wall Street forecasts, boosted by customers gained from rival airlines' 737 MAX cancellations and what CEO Ed Bastian said was a growing preference for the Delta brand.
Airlines that own Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX are together cancelling more than 10,000 monthly flights as the aircraft remains grounded following two deadly crashes. Delta does not operate the MAX, enabling it to grow its flight capacity and capture new customers while peers like Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co have had to scale back.
Atlanta-based Delta's net income rose 8% to $1.1 billion in the quarter to Dec. 31 from a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share hit $1.70, beating analysts' expectations for profit of $1.40 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Total operating revenue rose 7% to $11.4 billion. 
""There's no question that we're picking up new customers, but that's not the main driver of our performance,"" Bastian told Reuters, citing a strong brand and customer loyalty at a time when air travel demand continues to rise. 
Bastian sees the trend continuing in the first quarter with estimated revenue growth of 5% to 7% year-on-year as demand continues to rise ""at record levels.""
The carrier sees non-fuel unit costs growing 2% to 3% in the first quarter and revenues per available seat mile, a closely-watched metric, flat to 2% higher.
Delta, with 204 million passengers in 2019, generated $4.2 million of free cash flow for the year, a number it expects to repeat this year, allowing it to invest more in new technology to improve passenger experience.
As for new aircraft, Delta is still interested in Boeing's proposed new midsized airplane, known as the NMA, despite the planemaker's delayed decision on whether to launch the new aircraft as it continues to deal with the 737 MAX fallout.
Delta wants to remain a customer of both Boeing and Airbus SE but Bastian said the longer Boeing takes to decide on the NMA, the less options the airline has. Airbus' A321XLR and A330 could be alternatives to the new Boeing jet, he said. 
The airline is also still interested in investing around 100 million euro ($111.34 million) in the rescue of Italian flagship carrier Alitalia as the Italian government works on a new consortium, Bastian said.
Separately, Delta is working with regulators in South America on anti-trust immunity after closing this month the acquisition of a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group, he said.
Following the LATAM stake purchase, Delta unwound its partnership with Brazil's GOL, a move it said boosted fourth-quarter adjusted EPS by 9 cents.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 07:11AM ET</span>",Musk nears $346 million payday as Tesla market value soars,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk is coming close to earning the first $346 million tranche of options in a record-breaking pay package, after the electric vehicle maker's stock more than doubled in the last three months.
Shares of Tesla surged 9% to a record high on Monday. They need to rise another 6% to put Tesla's stock market value at $100 billion and then be sustained at that level for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock.
Musk has already hit an operational target that is also necessary for the options to vest.
For Musk's subsequent tranches to vest under the terms of the 2018 package, the company's market cap would have to continue to sustainably rise by $50 billion increments over the agreement's 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla's market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the electric car maker achieves several revenue and profit targets.
A full payoff for Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives, according Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisor that recommended investors reject the pay package deal at the time.
Musk receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla's market cap and milestones for growth.
""This is the very definition of pay for performance,"" said Ian Keas, senior director at Longnecker & Associates, an executive compensation consulting firm. ""But is he the only individual that could serve in that seat as CEO and deliver that value to shareholders? That's the billion dollar question.""
Musk's potential payout compares to the $638 million received by  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) founder Evan Spiegel in 2017 after the social network company's initial public offering. In 2018, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) CEO Robert Iger earned stock grants worth as much as $149.6 million, including awards related to Disney's purchase of film and television assets from Twenty-First Century Fox.
GRAPHIC: Tesla's rising market cap - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/942/939/TESLA.jpg
Musk has transformed Tesla from a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories. So far it has stayed ahead of more established rivals including BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
Last week, Tesla's stock market value hit nearly $89 billion, eclipsing the sum of General Motors' and Ford's for the first time, fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter.
Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth, however. More Wall Street analysts rate Tesla ""sell"" than ""buy,"" and the company's stock has been one of the most shorted on Wall Street.
Tesla was valued at about $53 billion when shareholders approved the pay package in January 2018 and faced a cash crunch, production delays and increasing competition from rivals. It was viewed as massively ambitious because it implied the company's value could grow as much as ten-fold in 10 years.
Last year, Musk hit two operational milestones, pulling in revenue above $20 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $1.5 billion over four straight quarters. Tesla's ""adjusted"" EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation, which in the first nine months of 2019 reached $617 million.
Musk currently owns about 34 million Tesla shares, equivalent to 19% of the company. His compensation package would let him buy another 20.3 million shares if all of his options vest.
When Tesla first unveiled Musk's package in 2018, it said Musk could in theory reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. Tesla has since awarded stock to employees and last year sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds."

Investing.com -- JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) earnings blew past expectations in the final quarter of 2019, rising 30% from a year earlier to $2.57 a share, a full 10% above consensus forecasts.
Revenue likewise far exceeded expectations, rising 9% on the year to $29.21 billion.
Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $27.87 billion.
The results were helped by an 8% increase in consumer loans, reflecting the sustained strength of U.S. spending.
“The U.S. consumer continues to be in a strong position and we see the benefits of this across our consumer businesses,” chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.
The bank’s corporate and investment bank also chipped in handily, with total markets revenue rising 56% on the year to $5.0 billion.
Reported net income edged down from the previous quarter to $8.5 billion, due in part to the sale of home loans.
Return on tangible common equity, a core measure of profitability, was 17% - down from 18% in the previous quarter but up from 14% in the final quarter of last year, which was marked by extreme volatility in global markets.
""JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is continuing to see strength in its consumer and investment banking units,"" said Haris Anwar, an analyst with Investing.com.

""As long as the economy and consumer spending remain robust, there is no major threat to the U.S. lenders, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),"" he added.
JPMorgan's shares were up 1.8% in premarket trading after the results, just shy of the record high of $141.10 that they hit at the start of the year. The shares have risen 30% since August, as the threat of a U.S. recession has dimmed.

MADRID (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) could receive its first deliveries of up to 10 grounded 737 MAX aircraft from Boeing (N:BA) by April, Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said on Tuesday, but cautioned the timing was dependent on regulators.
That is earlier than indicated by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary this month when he said the airline might not receive its first 737 MAX until October.
The 737 MAX, Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft, has not flown since last March following two crashes which claimed 346 lives. Ryanair has up to 210 of the planes on order, but none in service.
""We now think we will get it in March or April this year, looks more like April than March, and we think we will get up to 10 MAX aircraft,"" Jacobs told a news conference in Madrid. 
""It could still mean less than ten and the date could still change ... It has been a moving feast and the dates have slipped up to now for the past months,"" Jacobs said, adding all European airlines' orders were in the hands of regulators.
""We still think the MAX is a great aircraft. Our focus, their (Boeing's) focus now is just to get the MAX flying.""
Ryanair last month cut its passenger traffic forecast for the year to March 31, 2021, to 156 million from 157 million after scrapping some planned summer operations due to the MAX delays.
That forecast was based on Ryanair receiving 10 MAX aircraft in time for the summer season. It previously cut expectations to 20 from the 60 originally scheduled.

However, the airline has also since raised its profit forecast for the year to the end of March 2020 after a better-than-expected performance over Christmas and New Year.

The Safety Advisory Council will include representatives from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), and ""It's On Us"", a public awareness campaign launched by former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2014.
Lyft and rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc in the past have faced criticism over safety on their platforms and have been slapped with related lawsuits.
The move by Lyft comes after the release of Uber's first biennial U.S. Safety Report in December, in which the company said it received over 3,000 reports of sexual assault related to its 1.3 billion rides in the United States in 2018.
Lyft said the council will be led by Eman Barhoumeh, its vice president of safety and customer engagement."

LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock (N:BLK) Chief Executive Larry Fink has warned company boards to step up efforts to tackle climate change, marking a significant shift in the public stance of the world's biggest investment manager amid mounting concerns about global warming.
In his annual letter to CEOs, Fink said they must act or face increased wrath from investors concerned about how unsustainable business practices might curb their future wealth.
He said BlackRock would exit investments that presented high sustainability-related risk, including thermal coal producers, as it participated in what he described as a ""fundamental reshaping of finance"".
Fink's intervention comes at a time when investors are increasingly pressuring financial firms to do more to combat climate change.
The shift in global investing trends towards large asset managers such as BlackRock, with its $7 trillion in assets, has made it a potentially powerful lever for forcing wider corporate action.
But BlackRock and peers such as Vanguard Group and  State Street  Corp (N:STT) have been criticised for not doing enough to guide the firms they invest in, with a Reuters analysis in October finding they rarely challenge company management. 
Activists in December said they would be monitoring Fink's letter closely for signs of greater engagement with the climate crisis. 
BlackRock is also strengthening its commitment to transparency in its stewardship activities, with portfolio managers ""increasingly disposed to vote against management"" if they felt companies were not making ""sufficient progress on sustainability-related disclosures"".
""We don't yet know which predictions about climate change will be most accurate nor what effects we have failed to consider. But there is no denying the direction we are heading,"" the veteran investor said in the letter.
Fink's letter specifically aligns BlackRock with the goals of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, in contrast with the recent stance of the United States which under President Donald Trump has backed away from the climate accord.
""Every government, company and shareholder must confront climate change,"" Fink said. 
As well as applying pressure on companies through campaigning, activists in recent months have succeeded in winning over major investors in the financial sector to their cause.

 Barclays  (L:BARC) investors, at the urging of lobby group ShareAction, earlier this month submitted a motion that would force the lender to phase out fossil fuel financing faster.

Ford Vietnam, established in 1995, said the expanded factory would boost the U.S. automaker's annual capacity in Vietnam to 40,000 vehicles from current volume of 14,000 units per year.
The company reported it sold 32,175 cars in 2019, up 31% from a year earlier. 
The additional investment, which will bring the company's total investments in Vietnam to more than $200 million, will come in two stages over a two-year period starting this year.
Deputy Trade Minister Do Than Hai said he expected the expansion would reduce Vietnam's reliance on imported vehicles and therefore lower the country's trade deficit.
The construction will expand the facility across an additional 60,000 square meters of land, bringing the total area to 226,000 square meters.

Investing.com -- The broader market may be exhausted after the rally of the last few days, but mining stocks show no sign of slowing down, fired by hopes that the China-U.S. trade truce will finally put a bottom under Chinese demand for key industrial commodities.
  Glencore   (LON:GLEN) and   Antofagasta   (LON:ANTO) were both among the biggest gainers in the U.K. FTSE 100 in early Tuesday trading in London, rising 2.3% and 2.5% respectively, and not only because the continued weakness in sterling is inflating the value of their dollar earnings.
The pair are among the world’s largest producers of copper, the metal that historically shows a reliable correlation to global industrial activity. Copper, conspicuously, has been on a tear since the start of December, rising 9% in just over a month at the prospect of peace breaking out between the world’s two largest economies.
Copper futures for delivery on the London Metals Exchange hit $6,298.50 a ton on Tuesday, their highest since May 2019.  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO), a purer play on copper than the more diversified  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), is meanwhile at its highest since April.
Glencore’s rebound in the last month has been more modest, held back by a welter of legal investigations in the U.K., U.S. and Brazil. The company’s stock hit a three-year low in November on news that the – often toothless – U.K. Serious Fraud Office was investigating suspicions of bribery by the company, its employees, agents and associated persons.  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) said it will cooperate with the inquiry.
Tuesday’s outperformance is more notable for coming on the day that Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), the world’s biggest portfolio investor, said it will attach greater importance to sustainability and climate risks in its investment decisions in future. The mining sector is vulnerable to such concerns given the energy intensity of its business and the emissions generated by refining the raw materials it extracts.
Some of the biggest U.K.-listed miners have already seen the writing on the wall:   Rio Tinto   (LON:RIO) has already sold its thermal coal assets, citing its contribution to climate change, while BHP Group (LON:BHPB) has announced plans to exit the business.  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), by contrast, has only said it won’t increase coal production, while  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) has yet to commit to a date to exit the business.
By 5 AM ET (1000 GMT), the benchmark STOXX 600 had overcome some early weakness to trade 0.2% higher at 419.02. The German DAX was also up 0.2% while the French CAC 40 was flat."

LONDON (Reuters) - Stricken regional airline Flybe is important for Britain's transport links and the government will do what it can to help the company, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday ahead of a government meeting that could decide the airline's future. 
With Flybe's finances at breaking point, government officials will meet later to discuss potentially cutting air passenger taxes on all domestic flights to help rescue it. 
""It is not for government to step in and save companies that simply run into trouble, but be in no doubt that we see the importance of Flybe in delivering connectivity across the whole United Kingdom,"" Johnson told BBC television. 
""We're working very hard to do what we can.""
Flybe's flights appeared to be operating as normal on Tuesday, a day after news reports emerged suggesting it needed to raise new funds quickly to help it survive through the winter when demand for travel is lower.
Talks between Britain's finance department and Department for Transport (DfT) could lead to a cut to air passenger duty (APD) and a possible deal to allow Flybe to defer a payment of more than 100 million pounds ($130 million) for three years, according to Sky News. 
Under the plan, Flybe's owners, a group which includes Virgin Atlantic and which themselves rescued Flybe financially last year, would be required to invest tens of millions of pounds of new equity as a condition of any deal. 
CONNECTIVITY PROMISE
Rumours about the possible demise of Flybe have heaped pressure on Johnson's newly elected government. In December, his Conservative party won seats across regions served by Flybe, helped by a promise to improve connectivity outside London. 
Flybe's network of routes include more than half of UK domestic flights outside London. Based in Exeter, south west England, it carries eight million passengers a year between 71 airports in the UK and Europe. 
The aviation industry has long opposed APD, a tax of at least 13 pounds ($17) levied on passengers departing from UK airports.
Flybe has said its business is disproportionately harmed by the tax as it makes its flights more expensive versus its rail and road competitors, because passengers traveling on return flights within the UK will pay it twice. 
The DfT and Flybe declined to comment on the talks, while the finance department could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Should the government cut APD for domestic UK flights, other airlines such as easyJet (L:EZJ) and British Airways (L:ICAG), which fly routes such as London to Edinburgh, would also benefit. 
Flybe has 68 aircraft and about 2,000 staff and was already struggling financially when it was bought last year by Connect Airways, a consortium created by Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group (L:STOB) and investment adviser Cyrus Capital. 
It has suffered as the fuel price has risen in recent months, and news stories about its demise could cause a cash flow squeeze as potential customers stop booking. 

Should Flybe collapse, it would be the second high-profile failure in Britain's travel industry in less than six months after Thomas Cook went into liquidation last September, stranding thousands of passengers.

454,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 04:34AM ET</span>","China to ramp up U.S. car, aircraft, energy purchases in trade deal: source","By David Lawder and Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China has pledged to buy almost $80 billion of additional manufactured goods from the United States over the next two years as part of a trade war truce, according to a source,
likely giving a much-needed boost for planemaker Boeing.
Under the terms of the trade deal to be signed on Wednesday in Washington, China would also buy over $50 billion more in energy supplies, and boost purchases of U.S. services by about $35 billion over the same two-year period, the source told Reuters on Monday.
The Phase 1 agreement calls for Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods to increase by some $32 billion over two years, or roughly $16 billion a year, said the source, who was briefed on the deal.
When combined with the $24 billion U.S. agricultural export baseline in 2017, the total gets close to the $40 billion annual goal touted by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The numbers, expected to be announced on Wednesday at a White House signing ceremony between Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, represent a staggering increase over recent Chinese imports of U.S. manufactured goods, raising some skepticism over how it would be achieved.
BEYOND THE FARM
Two other sources familiar with the Phase 1 trade deal agreed with the rough breakdown of the purchases, without providing specific numbers.
A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office could not immediately be reached for comment.
Lighthizer on Monday called the deal a ""huge step forward"" for U.S.-China trade relations and ""a really, really good deal for the United States."" He told Fox Business Network that Beijing's compliance would be monitored closely.
""We expect them to live up to the letter of the law. We'll bring cases, we'll bring actions against them if they don't,"" Lighthizer said.
When the Phase 1 trade deal was struck on Dec. 13, U.S. officials said China had agreed to buy $200 billion in additional U.S. farm products, manufactured goods, energy and services over the next two years, compared to the baseline of 2017.
They said they would publish targets for the four broad areas, but would keep details of specific products classified to avoid market distortions.
The $32 billion agriculture increase over 2017 was confirmed by Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's head of international affairs, who spoke to reporters on Monday in Beijing.
While seeing room for China to boost purchases of wheat, soybeans, sorghum, dried distillers grains and some corn, analysts and traders doubted whether it could absorb such a big increase. Relying on the United States so heavily could expose China to price and supply risks, they said.
Trump had mainly touted the increased farm exports, which would benefit a major political constituency that has been battered by Chinese retaliatory tariffs during his 18-month trade war with Beijing.
Company executives have been waiting eagerly for details of what other U.S. goods China would be buying more of, aside from farm products, after 18 months of tit-for-tat tariffs that have stalled U.S. business investment.
MANUFACTURING CHALLENGES
The $80 billion increase for manufactured goods includes significant purchases of autos, auto parts, aircraft, agricultural machinery, medical devices and semiconductors, said one of the sources, without giving the names of any specific suppliers.
The aircraft would likely be built by  Boeing Co  (N:BA), the No. 1 U.S. exporter, whose new sales to China have ground to a halt over the past two years. That would be a welcome shot-in-the-arm for the aerospace giant, which has seen shares and earnings plummet as its best-selling 737 MAX aircraft remains grounded due to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.
The source providing the purchase figures expressed skepticism about manufactured goods pledges by Beijing since the U.S.-China trade deal does not address any of the non-tariff barriers that have kept these U.S. goods out of the Chinese market for decades, including procurement rules, product standards and subsidies to Chinese state-owned firms.
With Chinese car sales flagging and excess domestic assembly capacity on the rise, it's difficult to see the need for China to purchase significantly more U.S.-built cars. Among the most popular U.S.-built vehicles sold in China are BMW (DE:BMWG) and Mercedes-Benz (DE:DAIGn) sport-utility vehicles.
China also has major industrial policy goals to dominate the very manufacturing sectors in which it has pledged to pump up purchases of U.S. goods, further fueling skepticism.
Many economists and experts are dubious that the Phase 1 trade agreement will be implemented as written, despite what U.S. officials describe as an important enforcement clause in the deal.
That enforcement mechanism allows grievances to be aired through escalating consultations that would reach Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
If a U.S. claim of Chinese non-compliance cannot be resolved, Washington would have the right to reimpose tariffs on Chinese goods in proportion to the economic damage alleged. But nothing would preclude China from retaliating, returning the two sides to the current status quo, people familiar with the deal said.
Oil traders and analysts were also doubtful whether China would be able to purchase an extra $50 billion of energy products, including crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and imports of petrochemical raw materials such as ethane and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
Beijing-based SIA Energy analyst Seng Yick Tee said the target was ""too aggressive and unlikely to be achieved""."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Big e-commerce firms should not offer steep discounts, must disclose discounting policies and ensure they do not drive brick-and-mortar rivals out of business, India's antitrust chief said as his commission launched a probe into Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart's Flipkart.
The remarks come ahead of a visit by Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos to India this week - one likely to marked by much tension with the country's small business owners planning protests in 300 cities as they step up their campaign against what they see as unfair business practices.
In particular, the shopkeepers accuse the two U.S. giants of indulging in heavy discounts and giving preferential treatment to select sellers.
Openness about discounting policies and how companies use customers' data is essential, said Ashok Kumar Gupta, chairman of the Competition Commission of India (CCI). 
""If you are absolutely clean, come out, put it (details) on your website. So that everybody knows and there is nothing opaque,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
""Otherwise there will be complaints, we will inquire - why do you want to subject yourself to this type of investigation if you are open about it."" 
He did not refer to the companies by name. But just hours after his comments, the commission on Monday said it would be investigating Amazon and Flipkart, noting allegations of deep discounting and promoting ""preferred sellers"".
Bezos will likely participate in an Amazon event in New Delhi, sources have said. He has also sought meetings with the prime minister and other government officials, according to one source.
Amazon has committed $5.5 billion in India investments, while Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in 2018 pumped in $16 billion to buy a majority stake in Flipkart, its biggest deal.
Groups representing more than 70 million brick-and-mortar retailers say both firms violate India's foreign investment rules which were aimed at preventing sharp online discounts. The companies deny the allegations.
Gupta said there was nothing wrong in giving discounts if you were an insignificant player, but ""once you acquire market power, you cannot continue with these practices because you will start hurting the incumbent players.""
The CCI has said India is the world's fastest growing e-commerce market, expected to grow at an annual rate of 51% between 2017 and 2020. It estimates the sector will generate revenues of $120 billion this year.
""This sector has got us a lot of benefits ... We want this sector to grow, no doubt about it,"" Gupta said.

The CCI has asked its investigations arm to complete the probe within 60 days but typically such probes take much longer.

TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in  Renault  (PA:RENA) recovered some lost ground on Tuesday after the French carmaker and its Japanese partner Nissan Motor (T:7201) rejected media reports that their alliance was in danger of being dissolved.
Growing concerns about the state of the 20-year old French-Japanese alliance, forged by former boss turned fugitive Carlos Ghosn, had sent Renault and Nissan shares skidding to multi-year lows on Monday. 
At the opening of trading in Paris on Tuesday, Renault shares rose 1.3 percent, before falling back slightly to trade up 0.49 percent by 08:23 GMT.
The alliance, which also includes Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), is ""solid, robust, everything but dead,"" the chairman of Renault, Jean-Philippe Senard, told Belgian newspaper L'Echo.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire also weighed in, saying reports some executives wanted to break up the alliance were ""malicious.""
Speaking to France's CNews TV, he also said he expected Renault to name a new chief executive within days to replace Thierry Bollore, a Ghosn-era appointee who was ousted in October.
Luca de Meo, who stepped down as the head of Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Seat brand last week, is seen as a frontrunner for the job, although a stringent non-compete clause in his contract firm may prove a hurdle, sources have told Reuters. 
Nissan, in response to ""speculative international media reports,"" said it was ""in no way considering dissolving the alliance.""
""The alliance is the source of Nissan's competitiveness,"" the Japanese automaker said in a statement. 
""Through the alliance, to achieve sustainable and profitable growth, Nissan will look to continue delivering win-win results for all member companies.""
Concerns emerged about the future of the Renault-Nissan partnership after the November 2018 arrest in Japan of Ghosn, the man who did more than anyone else to hold together the disparate alliance of often-contrasting carmaking cultures.
Those worries were given new momentum after Ghosn last month fled Japan where he was awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct -- which he denies --, flew to Lebanon, and told the media the alliance was riven with mistrust.
Renault shares hit six-year lows on Monday as investors worried the French group's 20-year cost-sharing alliance with Nissan was headed for a break-up without Ghosn to hold it together.
A Financial Times report on Monday that Nissan executives were making contingency plans for a split with Renault appeared to accelerate a sell-off in the French manufacturer's shares.
Nissan shares tumbled to their lowest in 8-1/2 years on Tuesday in Tokyo.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - SoftBank-backed (T:9984) Oyo Hotels and Homes is laying off hundreds of employees in India, according to a source and an internal memo seen by Reuters, as the loss-making hotel chain cuts costs in pursuit of profits.
The move is part of a larger priority to drive profitability and sustainable growth, following a cash-guzzling expansion spree that took Oyo to dozens of new markets including China and the United States, an email from Chief Executive Ritesh Agarwal to Oyo employees on Monday showed.
""Some roles at OYO will become redundant as we further drive tech-enabled synergy, enhanced efficiency and remove duplication of effort across businesses or geographies,"" Agarwal wrote.
""As a result, we are asking some of our impacted colleagues to move to a new career outside of OYO.""
The email did not disclose the number of layoffs. However, a person briefed on the matter said the layoffs impact more than 1,000 employees in India across senior, mid-level and junior positions.
Four Oyo employees in the Indian cities of Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and the company's headquarters in Gurugram confirmed that employees were being asked to leave.
Local media have reported that Oyo was laying off anywhere between 1,000 and 2,000 employees in the country.
An Oyo representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The cost-cutting effort comes as Oyo's biggest investor SoftBank faces setbacks in some of its marquee investments, such as office-sharing startup WeWork, which it is bailing out after a failed public listing.
Other investments by the Japanese technology giant, including Uber (N:UBER), have also seen their valuations drop sharply.
Oyo, founded by Agarwal in 2013, has in particular been hit by a volley of unfavorable headlines in recent months.
It faces a growing backlash from several of its hotel partners, while internal projections have shown that Oyo may not make a profit in its two biggest markets until 2022, even as losses spiral.
Oyo's rapid growth was fueled in part by questionable practices, that included giving free lodging to police to deter trouble over illegal rooms, the New York Times reported https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/technology/oyo-softbank-india.html this month.
""We take all the allegations very seriously and are looking into each and every one,"" Agarwal wrote in Monday's email.
He also said the company would focus on ""profitable locations and buildings, and avoid growth that dilutes our margins"" and that Oyo would work to ""further reduce operating costs."""

By Peter Nurse 

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed lower Tuesday, as investors took a cautious view ahead of the start of the earnings season.
At 03:35 ET (08:35 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 21 points, or 0.3%, lower, France's CAC 40 was 49 points, or 0.8%, lower, while the DAX dropped 62 points, or 0.5%. The pan-Europe Euro Stoxx 50 index fell 30 points, 0.8%.
European earnings results will begin in earnest next week, but there are a number of U.S. reports due this week, starting today with banking giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) (NYSE:JPM),   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) (NYSE:C) and   Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC) (NYSE:WFC). The banks are often taken as a rough proxy for the health of the broader economy, and are thus likely to set the tone of the overall earnings season.

There was limited impact from news that China’s dollar-denominated exports and imports were both sharply higher than expected in December. Exports rose 7.6% on-year, against a 1.3% drop in November, while imports were 16.3% higher than a year ago, Reuters reported, citing data from the Chinese customs authority. Chinese export growth still hit a three-year low last year overall, as trade suffered from the expansion of U.S. import tariffs.
Strong import data from China tend to be positive news for European stock markets as the EU is China’s largest trading partner. Most of this trade is in industrial and manufactured goods.
Additionally, sentiment had received another boost overnight as the U.S. revoked its decision, taken last summer amid tensions between the two economic superpowers, to call China a currency manipulator - just days before the two countries are set to sign phase one of a trade deal.
The news helped raised optimism ahead of the U.S. and China signing the first phase of their trade deal on Wednesday. This phase one deal would prevent any further tit-for-tat tariffs and roll back some existing U.S. tariffs in Chinese goods.

Elsewhere, crude oil edged lower as investors kept a wary eye on tensions in the Middle East. However, gold futures lost ground as investors left the safe haven amid positive signs on the trade deal.
U.S. Crude Oil WTI Futures traded down 0.4% at $57.87 by 3:35 AM ET (08:35 GMT). International Brent Oil Futures also fell 0.3% to $64.03. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX fell 0.3% to $1,545.75."

Jose Luis Bernal, Mexico's ambassador to China, said that over the past year and a half his office has seen more interest from Chinese firms looking to make cars in Mexico.
Bernal, speaking at an event in Mexico City, listed Chongqing-based carmaker Changan, electric car maker BYD, and Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co, known as JAC, as actively eyeing production facilities in Mexico.
Changan and BYD do not yet have production facilities in Mexico, and while JAC does, Bernal said the firm is considering an expansion.
He added that the companies are aiming to begin the expanded Mexican operations sometime in the next year.
The firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

BEIJING/MANILA (Reuters) - China's appetite for high-grade iron ore this winter looks set to drop from the peaks hit in recent years as steel mills try to cut costs and prop up profit margins weighed down by the nation's slowing economy, industry sources said.
Demand for high-grade iron ore, which produces more molten iron than the same amount of lower grades of the steelmaking raw material, typically climbs from November to March, when China's winter anti-smog campaign forces smokestack industries to curtail output and use cleaner inputs to help clear the air.
But authorities in the world's top steel producer are taking a more lenient stance on emissions while the Chinese economy sputters, allowing mills room to cut costs by using more lower, cheaper grades of ore and fewer high-grade supplies.
(GRAPHIC: China's iron ore prices - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/655/655/price%20spread.png)
This trend impacts ore exporters like  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), BHP and Vale and is captured by the narrowing price spread of grades having between 65% and 62% iron content. So far in 2020 that price difference has been 20% narrower than it averaged in January 2019.
Miners in top global ore producer Australia are expected to benefit most from this switch as they mostly produce medium and low-grade ores, said Erik Hedborg, senior iron ore analyst at CRU consultancy.
Brazil's Vale SA, dominates the high-grade market, along with small miners in Canada, Ukraine and Sweden.
MARGIN SQUEEZE
China's trade war with the United States slowed its economy and sapped metal demand, prompting the penny-pinching by the Chinese steel mills.
A 60% surge in ore prices in early 2019 after a dam collapse at one of Vale's mines in Brazil also hurt steelmakers, pushing production margins well below where they averaged in 2018, when robust construction and manufacturing fueled a steelmaker boom.
Rebar margins in China's main steel hub in the north averaged 241 yuan per ton during the second half of 2019, roughly 70% below 2018's average of 788 yuan per ton, according to brokerage Jinrui Futures.
(GRAPHIC: Profit margins for rebar and HRC at Chinese mills - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/557/557/profits.png)
Sources say that even if China and the United States reach a trade deal, steel margins are not likely to rebound to their former peaks any time soon.
""Profitability in the steel industry may bounce back slightly from today's low level, but it's certainly not returning to the elevated 2018 levels,"" CRU's Hedborg said.
UNCLEAR OUTLOOK
While Beijing rolled out measures to prop up the economy in 2019, it's unclear how much additional stimulus may emerge in 2020 to boost steel demand, said Wu Shiping, an analyst with Tianfeng Futures.
China's steel use is seen dropping 0.6% this year, and iron ore demand by 3.1%, dragged down by slowing real estate and car sales, according to government consultancy China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute.

""Overall iron ore demand in the first quarter should be relatively stable,"" said an executive at a big steel mill in central China.
""But as profits are sliding, and downstream demand remains uncertain in spring, mills are relatively cautious on restocking,"" he said, requesting anonymity as he is not allowed to speak to media.

(Reuters) - U.S. venture capital-backed companies raised $23 billion in the last quarter of 2019, down 42.5% from the same period a year ago, according to a report by CB Insights and PWC released on Tuesday.
The report came as concerns about valuation rise, sparked by flops of several high-profile technology IPOs and the meltdown of office-sharing startup WeWork.
Despite the lower funding, startups last year received $108 billion in investments from U.S. venture capital firms, making it the third-biggest year ever, according to the report. Startups received $118 billion in 2018 and a record $119 billion in 2000, the year before the tech bubble burst.
The number of U.S.-based unicorns marked a new record of 199 at the end of 2019, up from 149 at the end of 2018. Unicorns are privately held companies valued at $1 billion or more.
Mega-rounds, deals that are $100 million and bigger, also dropped in the fourth quarter to 38 with a total $7.3 billion raised, from 54 in the fourth quarter of 2018 with a total $25.3 billion raised, according to the report.
Softbank Group Corp (T:9984) participated in four of the five biggest rounds, including an investment in WeWork, which scrapped its IPO in September amid a public shareholder-founder dispute.
The fourth-quarter drop in funding and mega-rounds followed that event."

Speaking at a conference in Singapore on Tuesday, Mark Haefele said investors should expect a low-return environment where they will have to work for their dollar harder, potentially moving into equities. The search for yield has compelled large institutions to rebalance portfolios toward stocks and private investments, and that’s one of the reasons why markets have been so strong in January, he added.
“As central banks flood the markets with liquidity, that pulls forward a lot of your returns,” the Zurich-based executive said. “That’s simply the way it is.”
Haefele joins his Wall Street counterparts in voicing concerns over returns this year after the MSCI All-Country World Index surged 24% in 2019.
Investors will likely face muted equity performance, coupled with about $11 trillion in negative-yielding debt globally, according to UBS Global Wealth Management’s 2020 outlook. While it sees earnings growth of 10% and returns of low to mid teens for Asia ex-Japan shares, it expects a mere 5% profit growth at U.S. companies and a 3% contraction for those in the euro area.
Haefele recommends dividend-paying stocks and companies with greater profitability, lower financial leverage and less earnings volatility than the overall index. “A dividend strategy can provide that supplemental income and help protect your portfolio even if you’re forced to move into equities,” the investment chief said.
The money manager, which oversees more than $2.5 trillion of assets, also recommends investing in 5G technology and gene therapy as themes for the decade.
“There’s going to be massive investments” in 5G, particularly in Asia, Haefele said. “You’re going to have rates of return in that sector that are greater than global GDP growth.”"

The consortium's application, which Meng and the Attorney General of Canada opposed, sought to record and broadcast the ""double criminality"" portion of the proceedings set for Jan. 20, according to the ruling issued by the Supreme Court of British Columbia.
The consortium, consisting of 13 media organizations, says the ""double criminality"" portion of the proceedings will involve only a question of law, and that question will not directly engage Meng's fair trial rights since it does not pertain to her guilt or innocence.
A crucial test in Canadian extradition law is ""double criminality"", which means conduct must be illegal in Canada as well as in the country seeking extradition.
One of the reasons Meng was against media's request was because she thought broadcasting of the hearings could compromise her fair trial rights in the extradition proceedings, and in a trial in the U.S. if she is extradited.
The Attorney General backed Meng and said there were risks of distorting the public perception of the proceedings and of disturbing the serenity of the court process, and the cumulative effect of those factors on Meng's right to a fair trial in the U.S.
Meng, 47, was arrested at the Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018, at the request of the United States, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading the bank HSBC about Huawei's business in Iran."

Consumer prices rose 7.35% last month, exceeding the 6.7% median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, official data late Monday showed.
The inflation jump, largely driven by food prices, risks stalling the recent rally in the nation’s bond markets. With high consumer prices limiting the ability of the Reserve Bank of India to cut rates further to revive economic growth, the government may be forced to spend more.
“In the short term, sentiment on the benchmark 10-year will be hit,” said A. Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. in Mumbai. Yields may rise as much as seven basis points at the open, he said.

Separately, the RBI said that it swapped debt with the government on Monday, selling 419.2 billion rupees ($5.9 billion) worth of bonds maturing in 2020 in exchange for longer-dated notes.
The debt swap could significantly lower the probability of further Twist operations by the RBI, said Prasanna.

1. Banks Get Earnings Season Going
The banks kick off earnings season in earnest this week, with three big names reporting before the bell tomorrow.
Financials have had a strong run and valuation is in focus, so guidance will be especially important.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is expected to report a profit off $2.35 per share on revenue of $27.87 billion, according to analyst forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Net interest income is forecast to come in between $58 billion and $60 billion, with net interest margin down to 2.37% from 2.41% in the previous quarter.
  Citigroup   (NYSE:C) also weighs in ahead of trading. The bank is expected to post earnings of $1.82 per share on revenue of $17.89 billion.
And   Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC) rounds out the big financial reports.
Analysts predict that  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) earned $1.12 per share with revenue of $20.11 billion.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is also scheduled to report ahead of trading.
Analysts are looking for a profit of $1.40 per share with revenue of $11.34 billion.
2. Retail Inflation Arrives
Inflation highlights the economic calendar tomorrow.
The Labor Department will issue the December consumer price index (CPI) at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists expect the CPI to have risen 0.3% last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast show a 0.2% rise for the month.
Year on year, the core CPI is expected to be up 2.3%, the same as in November.
3. API Inventories on Tap Amid Oversupply Concerns
Crude oil stumbled again today as traders worried about an oversupplied market.
They’ll get more information on that front after the bell tomorrow when the American Petroleum Institute releases its inventory numbers.
API’s snapshot of U.S. oil inventories comes out at 4:30 PM ET (21:30 GMT). While not perfectly correlated the numbers do give a indication of where Wednesday’s official government data may be leaning.
Last week the API reported a drawdown of about 5.9 million barrels.

Visa closed 0.8% higher on Monday and shares were up slightly in after-hours trading.
Plaid, valued at roughly $2.65 billion in a 2018 funding round, produces products to enable consumers to conveniently share their financial information with thousands of apps and services such as Acorns, Betterment, Chime, Transferwise and PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo. 
The acquisition of Plaid is expected to open new market opportunities for Visa, both in the U.S. and internationally, deliver enhanced payment capabilities and related value-added services to fintech developers and enable the financial company to work more closely with fintechs through all stages of their development, Visa (NYSE:V) said.
“We have strong relationships with both Visa and Plaid. The combination of Plaid’s capabilities with the security and scale of Visa’s global network will provide us with exciting opportunities to enhance our products,” said Dan Schulman, president and CEO of PayPal.
“We believe Visa’s acquisition of Plaid is an important development in giving consumers more security and control over how their financial data is used,"" said Gordon Smith, co-president, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and CEO of Consumer and Community Banking. ""Protecting customer data and helping them share that information safely has long been a top priority for Chase. We look forward to partnering with Visa to continue building a great experience for our shared customers.” 
The transaction, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the next three to six months.

476,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 04:01PM ET</span>","Stocks - S&P, Nasdaq Hit All-Time Highs as Tech Continues to Shine","Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at record highs on Monday, as sentiment on U.S.-China trade received a boost on reports that the White House will no longer label China a currency manipulator. That comes just days ahead of the expected conclusion of the phase one trade deal.
The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.04% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.28%, 
The White House plans to remove its designation of China as a currency manipulator, according to published reports.
The U.S. government last summer tagged China with the label of currency manipulator when tensions between Washington and Beijing threatened to boil over.
The news helped raised optimism ahead of the U.S. and China signing the first phase of their trade deal on Wednesday.
The phase one trade deal would halt any escalations in tit-for-tat tariffs and roll back some existing U.S. tariffs in Chinese goods.
The positive sentiment on trade coupled with bullish calls from Wall Street on tech heavyweights like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) helped tech stocks continued their march higher.
Apple closed at record highs after DA Davidson hiked its price target on the tech giant amid expectations it will roll out 5G iPhones later this year.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended the day more than 1% higher after Credit Suisse raised its price target on the tech giant to $180 from $155.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged 9%, topping $500 for the first time, underpinned by a target price hike from Oppenheimer to $612 from $358
Industrials, meanwhile, also played a part in the broader market rally, led by gains in   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) on bullish remarks from Deutsche Bank
""We see the potential for GE to deliver a beat in 4Q19 and 2020 guidance that suggests upside to current consensus at the midpoint of the range,""   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) said.
Healthcare, however, proved an exception to broader rally as news that presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had taken the lead in Iowa raised concerns about the private healthcare insurance market.
Sanders has backed proposals for a universal Medicare plan, where people could be guaranteed coverage without using private insurance. 
Cigna (NYSE:CI) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) slipped about 3%, while   Centene   (NYSE:CNC) fell about 2%.
Energy, meanwhile, was roughly unchanged as oil prices slipped to five-week lows, down 1.6%, as oversupply worries resurfaced amid softer seasonal demand."

 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) shares climbed 4.6% in afternoon trading.
Needham analyst Lara Martin wrote that among the takeaways from CES in Las Vegas, she and her team are raising active account estimates for the end of 2019, tied to Disney+ adoption, Briefing.com reported.
Roku will get higher economic share as its U.S. platform grows and the company will benefit from increased ad spending from Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and others as the “DTC Customer Acquisition War” heats up, Martin added.
Also in the sector, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) rose 2.9%.
Last week J.P. Morgan said it was bullish on subscribers for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) following an update of its model.
“Net-net, we come away with increased confidence in Netflix's multi-year international growth potential, and we are raising our longer term global paid streaming subscriber estimates,” J.P. Morgan said. “We now project 300 (million) global streaming subs in 2024.”"

Needham analyst Ari Shusterman upgraded Nvidia to hold from underperform, sending the chipmaker's shares up 3%.
""Gaming is showing signs of positive momentum as attach rates for ray tracing games have accelerated. Hyperscalers have also begun to spend again on AI workloads,"" Shusterman said.
The upgrade from Shusterman marked a turnaround from a year ago, when he raised concerns that Nvidia would experience slowing sales of consumer graphics cards and hyperscaler spending amid a global economic slowdown.
The then-bearish call, however, failed to materialize as Nvidia oversaw an ""aggressive"" channel refill, the analysts said.
Looking ahead to the first half of the year, the path for Nvidia is somewhat easier as it faces easy year-over-year comparisons, particularly in graphics and data center, he added.
Needham is not the only one on Wall Street touting growth for Nvidia's gaming business.
Benchmark analyst Ruben Roy recently increased the target price on Nvidia to $275 from $240 on expectations that the chipmaker will benefit from a ""reacceleration of data center spending, coupled with an improving demand environment for GPUs in gaming end markets.""
""Potential catalysts for Nvidia shares in 2020 include positive bias to estimates on contnued data center demand improvement, visibility into its 7nm product road map, and the closing of the pending Mellanox acquisition,"" Roy added."
479,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 02:41PM ET</span>",U.S. Budget Deficit Widens 11.8% in First Quarter of Fiscal Year,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. budget deficit widened to $356.6 billion in the first three months of fiscal 2020 as spending rose more than revenue, keeping the federal shortfall on pace to exceed $1 trillion by year-end.
The gap increased 11.8% from the $318.9 billion in October-December of the previous year, the Treasury Department said in its monthly budget report Monday. Government outlays increased 6.7%, while receipts rose 4.6%. The U.S. posted a $13.3 billion deficit in December alone compared with $13.5 billion a year earlier.
The three biggest spending categories are social security, national defense and Medicare, which all increased in the quarter. Outlays rose to $285 billion for social security, to $187 billion for the military and to $393 billion for Medicare and Medicaid. Those overshadowed corporate income taxes, which jumped by 23% to $65 billion, and individual taxes which were about 3% higher at $385 billion.
Spending for mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid is expected to increase along with an aging population, and interest payments will form a greater share of total payments, according to the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, a non-partisan government body.
Meanwhile, U.S. tariffs charged on imports from China and other nations increased by almost 20% to $21 billion in the first quarter of the fiscal year from the same period the previous year. The levies are paid by U.S. importers.
The fiscal deficit is set to surpass $1 trillion in fiscal 2020, according to the CBO. That would be the highest since the financial crisis, when the government significantly boosted spending. As a share of gross domestic product, though, the total deficit will only be about 5%, compared with double that in the recession."

On Friday, Selzer & Co. released a poll of likely voters in the Iowa caucuses that showed Sanders in the lead at 20%.
Sanders was followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 17%, Pete Buttigieg at 16% and former Vice President Joe Biden at 15%.
Sanders is a harsh critic of private health insurers and is running on a promise to provide a Medicare for All healthcare program.
That would be a “single-payer, national health insurance program to provide everyone in America with comprehensive health care coverage, free at the point of service” with “(n)o networks, no premiums, no deductibles, no copays, no surprise bills,” according to the candidate’s website.
Among the insurers, Cigna (NYSE:CI) fell 3.7%, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) lost 3.1%, Humana (NYSE:HUM) was down 2.6% and Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) dropped 3.2%.

481,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 02:22PM ET</span>","Energy Shares Are ‘Downright Cheap,’ David Rosenberg Says","(Bloomberg) -- Energy stocks are cheap among S&P 500 peers, and there’s already plenty of bad news baked into the sector, according to David Rosenberg.
“In a world where everything looks so expensive, energy stocks look downright cheap,” Rosenberg, the chief economist & strategist of newly formed Rosenberg Research and Associates, told clients in a note.
His call comes as oil markets weigh geopolitical risk, while U.S. shale companies attempt to lure investors back after extended underperformance.
Energy stocks staged a mid-December rally, but have cooled alongside crude oil and eased U.S.-Iran tensions. The sector risk-reward looks more balanced after such events,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) told clients early Monday, downgrading the exploration & production group to “in-line.”
“At a minimum, the group is priced for a much weaker oil environment than what we have on our hands,” Rosenberg said.
In addition to the sector’s valuation, investors have expected negative events for some time. “There are few sectors in the equity market that have this characteristic of having bad news priced in at this moment,” he wrote. “But in the energy space, perhaps in the overall materials sector as well, all that has to happen is for something bad not to happen and there will be a positive rerating as the end-result.”

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index to all-time intraday highs. Gains extended after the U.S. was said to plan to lift its designation of China as a currency manipulator. Earnings from some of the biggest U.S. banks kick off the season Tuesday, amid forecasts that overall corporate profits will show the smallest growth in three years.
“Our expectation is a solid earnings season -- nothing extraordinary but nothing really terrible,” Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, told Bloomberg TV. “The environment is so accommodative that it really is supportive of risk assets, including equities, even if we have a lackluster earnings season.”
The pound led declines among Group-of-10 currencies after another Bank of England official pointed to a potential vote for a U.K. interest-rate cut this month and data showed the economy unexpectedly shrank. Germany’s benchmark bund yield headed for least negative closing level since May. The offshore yuan strengthened past 6.9 per dollar for the first time since July.
The dollar edged higher and Treasuries fell across the curve as the completion of the first trade deal nears; President Donald Trump has said the U.S. and China will sign the accord on Wednesday. The U.S. in August first formally labeled China a currency-manipulator, a move that further escalated the trade war with Beijing after the country’s central bank allowed the yuan to fall in retaliation to new U.S. tariffs.
“The consumer is super strong, the economy is strong, but slowing. The Fed’s on the sidelines. China’s on the sidelines now as a headline, and we dodged the giant bullet with Iran, no pun intended,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management. “And so what you have is no news and everything is kind of OK.”

485,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 01:06PM ET</span>",Vanguard’s 1% U.S. Growth Call Is Rooted in Bond Market’s Wisdom,"(Bloomberg) -- Vanguard is more bearish on the U.S. economy than most forecasters, heeding what it says is a warning sign from the Treasury market.
The $5.7 trillion asset manager expects lingering trade tensions, unpredictable government policy and a drop in consumer spending to drag down growth to just 1% in 2020, from an estimated 2.3% expansion in 2019. The call is among the most bearish on Wall Street, trailing the median estimate among economists for a 1.8% increase in gross domestic product, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Treasury yields near multiyear lows are helping to underpin Vanguard’s forecast, according to Joseph Davis, the firm’s chief economist and global head of the Vanguard Investment Strategy Group. The $16.7 trillion Treasury market is pricing in 2% growth “at best” this year, while the equity market’s rally is projecting a figure closer to 3%, he said. For a tried-and-true reading on where the U.S. economy is heading, Davis said he prefers to listen to signals from the bond market.
“History tells us the bond market is generally smarter,” Davis said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “If I had to pick one market, I’d pick the bond market.”
U.S.-China trade tensions and three Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts pushed down benchmark 10-year Treasury yields by roughly 77 basis points in 2019, the biggest drop since 2014. U.S. equities rallied in tandem, with the S&P 500 Index climbing nearly 29% for the gauge’s best year since 2013.
That dynamic has continued in 2020’s first few trading days. The S&P 500 has added roughly 1.8% year-to-date, while 10-year yields have pushed lower by about 6 basis points to trade near 1.85%.
Of course, the bond market isn’t “infallible,” Davis says. Vanguard isn’t calling for a recession in 2020, despite August’s yield curve inversion, which is often considered a harbinger of a U.S. economic downturn beginning in the next 18 months.
With growth cooling and low risks of an inflation spike, Davis is modestly long on fixed-income duration. Additionally, while not anticipating a global growth rebound, he expects overseas equities markets to outperform U.S. shares.
“Our outlook is not pessimistic,” Davis said. “It’s reasonable.”"
486,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 01:01PM ET</span>",StockBeat : Apple Continues March Into Record Territory on Upgrade,"Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continued its ride higher into record territory Monday after DA Davidson hiked its price target on the tech giant amid expectations it will roll out 5G iPhones later this year.
DA Davidson raised its price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $375 from $300, forecasting a near-20% rise from current prices. Apple rose about 0.9% after hitting an intraday record high of $313.38. 
With the iPhone maker expected to release 5G featured phones later this fall, DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte said: ""there is enough complexity and hype when it comes to 5G that we believe Apple can exploit this multi-year opportunity.""
This year’s iPhones are expected to come in new sizes, one with a 5.4-inch display, two with a 6.1-inch displays and one with a much larger 6.7-inch screen. 
Apple's run to all-time highs has been supported by a slew of recent upgrades from Wall Street.
Just last month, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) raised its price target on Apple, estimating that 5G iPhones will drive consistent 200 million iPhone sales during 2020 to 2022. The bank also highlighted the continuing strong demand for the existing iPhones that were unveiled in September last year.
The upcoming launch of Apple's 5G iPhone has been touted as an important upgrade cycle as the tech giant's most recent slate of smartphones has not generated the fanfare and record sales that were once commonplace.
Some on Wall Street have suggested investors temper their expectations for the pace of 5G adoption.
""Ultimately, this is a massive opportunity for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), huge play on 5G, but it’s going to take a while for networks to roll out coverage,"" Gene Munster, co-founder of research-driven venture capital firm Loup Ventures, said in December.
Those claims were backed up somewhat by TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said that countries with little to no 5G coverage will receive phones with 5G disabled to save on manufacturing costs.
Ming-Chi Kuo forecasts that Apple will sell between 80 and 85 million iPhones that feature 5G connectivity."

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index higher. The Stoxx Europe 600 swung from a gain to a loss, while major indexes in Asia closed higher. Earnings from some of the biggest U.S. banks kick off the season Tuesday, amid forecasts that overall corporate profits will show the smallest growth in three years.

496,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 09:26AM ET</span>",Russian Billionaire Loses Lawsuit Against Nordic Banks,"(Bloomberg) -- A group of Nordic banks sued by a Russian oligarch aren’t required to accept his business, according to what may prove to be a landmark ruling by a court in Finland.
Russian billionaire Boris Rotenberg, an associate of President Vladimir Putin, lost his lawsuit against four Nordic banks and was ordered to pay more than 500,000 euros ($556,000) to cover their legal fees, the Helsinki District Court ruled on Monday.
The court said that forcing the banks to accept business from Rotenberg, who is on the U.S. sanctions list, would have subjected them to significant financial risk which they, by law, are prohibited from taking.
The lawsuit targeted   Svenska Handelsbanken   AB (ST:SHBa) for refusing to accept cross-border deposits from Rotenberg, and Nordea Bank Abp (SIX:NDB), OP Group and   Danske Bank   A/S (CSE:DANSKE) for not processing payments to vendors for basics including Rotenberg’s electricity bills.
Jakob Dedenroth Bernhoft, a Copenhagen-based lawyer who specializes in compliance and money laundering issues, said the decision would set an important precedent.
“All the other banks will look at this decision from the court for guidance on what to do in a similar situation,” Bernhoft said by phone before the verdict was delivered.
At stake was the banks’ access to the U.S. dollar market, which is crucial to their ability to operate.
The case comes against a backdrop of money-laundering scandals in the region, with regulators ratcheting up compliance requirements. Banks are also under increasing pressure to identify dodgy customers. According to documents provided to the court, Rotenberg has a current account at Handelsbanken, which the bank has supplied on the recommendation of the Finnish Financial Ombudsman Bureau.
Rotenberg had argued that his status as a dual citizen of both Russia and Finland meant that banks based in Europe must process his transactions. But the court said Rotenberg failed to prove he resides in a European Economic Area country, and thus has no such rights to basic banking services as mandated by law.
The court’s panel of judges ruled unanimously, but the verdict can be appealed. Rotenberg has seven days to express his dissatisfaction with the ruling, the court said."

Under the terms of the offer, shareholders would ultimately receive 0.36 Class A shares in Brookfield Renewable for each share they hold. That would be worth $17.29 at Friday's close for Brookfield Renewable.

8:42 AM: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was up 0.7%, just under half of the gain it needs to crack a market capitalization of $1 trillion for the first time.
There's no market-relevant news flow out of the company this morning, but shares have been on the rise since the news that Google CEO Sundar Pichai would take over as CEO of the holding company too, following the departures of co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Its market cap at the close Friday stood at $985 billion.

The deal will allow the two companies to rationalize as they try to cope with the fallout from Boeing’s grounded 737 MAX.
Under the terms of a deal styled as a ‘merger of equals’, Woodward shareholders will end up with 55% of the combined company, as Hexcel shareholders receive 0.625 Woodward shares for each Hexcel share they own.
Hexcel chairman and CEO Nick Stanage will become CEO of the combined company, while Woodward chairman and CEO Tom Gendron will serve as executive chairman until a year after the deal closes. He’ll stay on the board as non-executive chairman for a further year after that. 
8:14 AM ET: Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock rose 0.4% after reporting a 26% drop in sales in China last year, the third year in a row that its sales have fallen there, but a slower decline than in 2018. The company also said it expects the Chinese market to keep shrinking this year.
8:11 AM ET: Anixter (NYSE:AXE) and Wesco International (NYSE:WCC) stock were both in focus after the companies agreed to a cash-and-stock merger that values the former at around $100 a share, 1.5% above Friday’s closing price.
Under the deal, Anixter shareholders will have the right to receive $70 per share in cash, with the balance made up by Wesco stock valued at $15.89 a share.
The deal will leave Wesco’s existing shareholders with 84% of the combined company, and Anixter shareholders with 16%.

499,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 07:56AM ET</span>",Goldman Readies a Hiring Spree and Capital to Meet Its China Ambitions,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.
The news swept through Goldman’s offices around China, changing everything.
On a Friday afternoon in late 2017, an official in Beijing announced that the world’s most populous nation would let Wall Street banks expand across its markets. Goldman had spent more than a decade waiting in frustration for that chance. Regional bosses including James Paradise and Todd Leland urgently worked the phones, pinning down details to inform headquarters in New York.
Since then,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). has spoken publicly only in broad strokes about its strategy for China as the gates come down this year. But inside the firm, a massive effort is taking shape. Three months ago, a team of executives presented a five-year plan for China to the board, calling for the bank to take control of a joint venture it set up with a Chinese securities firm in 2004. Infused with hundreds of millions of dollars in new capital, the unit would embark on a hiring spree to double its workforce to 600 and ramp up a wide variety of businesses.
The strategy -- described by senior Goldman executives and others familiar with the plan -- shows how Chief Executive Officer David Solomon and President John Waldron are taking up the mantle once carried by former CEO Hank Paulson, betting China will finally make the world’s second-largest economy a more level playing field for foreign investment banks. Last year, they traveled to China seven times to meet senior officials, laying the groundwork. Another round of visits is set for 2020.
“We’re increasingly optimistic that we’re going to have the opportunity to actually move more in the right direction, maybe even faster than we thought,” Waldron said in an interview last week. “If you’re going to have a successful business in China, you need to have an appropriate relationship with the government because so much happening in China relates to the government.”
Revenue Pressure
Global investment banks have been stymied from expanding in China amid its economic rise this century. Its laws required foreign firms do local securities business through joint ventures with Chinese partners, who kept controlling stakes. That put U.S. and European firms in the uncomfortable position of risking their capital without the final say on strategy or deals.
Now, a growing number of banks are seeking permission to take over those entities. Goldman applied in August to increase its stake in Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co. to 51% from 33%. Internally, executives talk about owning the entire business as soon as possible.
China is opening at a key moment for Goldman, offering the bank another frontier as it faces mounting pressure to find ways to boost revenue. Analysts estimate the bank will confirm this week that revenue fell in 2019. It’s expected to brief investors on its broader strategy in coming weeks.
Still, its plan to ambitiously ramp up the venture is striking after a decade in which top executives said they didn’t want to “overinvest” in winning investment banking mandates from China amid its restrictions. In that time, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and UBS Group Inc. both established a larger presence than Goldman inside the country.
Goldman intends to add to its advisory, markets and merchant banking operations on the mainland. And in a twist, its executives are especially excited about what Waldron calls the potential for “gigantic” growth in its nascent business of tending wealth there. “The biggest opportunity in China is actually not in investment banking,” he said. “The biggest opportunity in China is to be an asset manager for all the savings.”
Long Wait
It would be understandable if the bank were less enthusiastic about expanding in China, given how long it’s waited.
As the country’s economy took off in the 1990s, Goldman was among global banks that seized the opportunity, reaping fees by advising government-backed entities on billions of dollars of stock listings. A decade later, the bank made another bundle as China desperately sought to recapitalize its lenders. By 2006, Paulson arranged what was then Goldman’s biggest-ever principal bet -- a $2.58 billion investment in Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. that produced an estimated $12 billion in dividends and proceeds by the time the firm unloaded it in 2013.
But hopes of running a wholly owned securities division inside China kept getting thwarted.
Paulson made at least 70 trips to China as the firm’s leader, for a time becoming the most famous foreigner there who wasn’t either a head of state or pop star. When he set up the bank’s joint venture with Beijing Gao Hua Securities in 2004, he declared the company was entering “an exciting new chapter.”
But not too long after Paulson stepped down in 2006, cracks started forming in markets that led to a global credit crisis in 2008. Goldman’s star in China faded and officials became highly skeptical of all foreign banks’ practices, products and advice, people familiar with their thinking said.
Paulson’s successor, Lloyd Blankfein, didn’t travel to China as often. Instead, he spent much of his tenure guiding the firm through the fallout of the crisis, adjusting strategy for an era of stiffer regulation and capital requirements. While Blankfein publicly proclaimed this as China’s century, he and other bank chiefs struggled to persuade reluctant Beijing officials to open their market. After the government took some steps, its suspicions of banks such as Goldman flared anew in 2015 when the nation’s stock market swooned. The expansion Paulson sought to set up for Blankfein never materialized.
The result is that Goldman has booked relatively paltry profits onshore, instead focusing mainly on helping Chinese clients tap markets abroad. Inside China, the bank’s best year was 2015, when it generated roughly $120 million in revenue from investment banking, asset management and brokerage operations with its Chinese partner, according to filings by Gao Hua Securities Co. Its onshore revenue in 2018 equates to far less than 1% of what the country’s entire securities industry generated that year.
China’s Surprise
Blankfein happened to be in Beijing with President Donald Trump in November 2017 as China prepared to make its surprise declaration about opening its market for financial firms. Somewhat famously, Trump didn’t know it was coming. Blankfein boarded a plane before the announcement, and if he knew about it, he didn’t let on. Inside Goldman, executives who had worked directly with the government and suspected something was afoot were caught off guard.
“There was an instant reaction internally,” Paradise recalled in an interview, snapping his fingers. He and Leland oversee Goldman’s businesses in the Asia-Pacific region except for Japan. “And the first people to see and read that news were people in this time zone.”
Banks such as Goldman are hoping that breakthrough will be followed by a regulatory and legal framework in China that will let them sell more sophisticated products and services on the mainland, akin to what’s available in other parts of the world. Offering ways to hedge or diversify investments, for example, can be lucrative for securities firms, but it could also help make China’s capital markets more robust. The pace of Goldman’s expansion will depend on how that develops, Paradise said.
For years, Goldman had been lobbying the government and soliciting regulators’ thoughts on proposed products, Leland said. But the conversation has since reversed as officials show interest in giving Chinese companies access to more capital and financial tools. “Now, it’s them asking us: ‘Would you do this, could you do that?’” Leland said. “That encourages us to move quicker.”
The bank has been working with authorities to teach them about financial products not yet widely available in China, such as derivatives. The thinking is that young Chinese companies will need to shift from focusing solely on grabbing market share to generating reliable profits to attract foreign shareholders. And for that, they will need to hedge risks.
Tending Wealth
The country’s burgeoning wealth makes asset management a priority, too. High-net-worth people there still have relatively few investment options.
Should China continue its reform pace, Goldman estimates its private bankers will be able to grow the assets they manage at an average percentage rate in the mid-teens over the next five years, which would potentially double onshore revenue, according to Ron Lee, Asia Pacific head of investment management. “If we add bankers, and there’s a growth rate, we can grow even faster,” he said. “We’re looking to do both.”
Once it gains control, the bank will rebrand its wealth business to feature only its own name, rather than including Gao Hua. It also plans to expand its footprint outside of Beijing and Shanghai to the surging metropolis of Shenzhen, home to legions of factories and more than 20 million people. The firm is already interviewing bankers and finding office space there, Lee said. Yet there are limits to how quickly it can add private bankers.
“The reality is we’re finding that because the wealth management landscape is relatively nascent in China, the talent pool is relatively limited, so we have to be a little more patient,” Lee said. “We’re looking for a high, but steady, growth rate.”"

The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index rose as much as 1.9% to 120,899.69 on Monday, surpassing the benchmark’s record closing high and adding to their advance after emerging as the surprise winners last week amid the fallout from the Iran-U.S. crisis. Shares in Turkish banks and steelmaker Eregli (IS:EREGL) led the benchmark index higher.
Istanbul stocks are trading at a discount of almost 50% to their emerging-market peers. The imminent signing of a partial U.S-China trade deal is stoking optimism, adding to upbeat sentiment from the ebbing of Middle East tensions. Gains in the local currency and positive news on the economy encouraged the flow of cash to Turkish assets, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank.

“The stronger Turkish lira and current account data released this morning gave a solid basis for the stock rally, even though the data fell slightly short of the market expectations,” said Ozkardeskaya. “Cheap valuations also give an additional boost to the upside move, making long positions more appetizing for investors as they become convinced that it may be the right time and the right price to enter the market.”
Overall, the environment for emerging market equities is quite positive, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists including Mislav Matejka wrote in a note on Monday. “Episodes of geopolitical uncertainty were historically buying opportunities, rather than the reasons to start selling,” they wrote, adding that emerging market stocks are trading at relative valuation levels that are near multiyear lows.
Turkish stocks have climbed 44% from the last low touched in May, as 1,200 basis points of central bank rate cuts that spurred the economy and dulled the allure of deposit accounts combined with a relatively stable lira and a revival in risk-on sentiment fueled gains. The main index set its record high in January 2018 after a 48% jump during 2017 supported by a flow of loans to companies from the national Credit Guarantee Fund.
The Borsa Istanbul 30 Index, a gauge of local blue-chip stocks, surged 8.4% in dollar terms last week, while the benchmark index jumped 8.3%, making them the top performers worldwide as upbeat guidance from some of Turkey’s largest banks for 2020 and the relative easing in oil prices highlighted the appeal of stocks in the net importer of crude.
“The downside correction in energy prices and stronger lira should continue giving support to Turkish stocks in the coming days, especially if production data confirms improved activity in November and the central bank goes ahead with another rate cut on Thursday,” Kardeskaya said.
The main Turkish index traded 1.5% higher at 120,393 points as of 1:58 p.m. in Istanbul."

The Iranian authorities may be under pressure from domestic protests over the downing of the Ukrainian passenger plane last week, but fears of major military action in the Middle East have dimmed. At the same time, news that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s chief trade negotiator will sign a 'phase one' trade deal with the U.S. on Wednesday has boosted sentiment. 
Friday’s disappointing nonfarm payrolls release took some of the froth off the U.S. stock markets, but this increases the chances of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates at very low levels for the foreseeable future. And investors are reacting positively to the combination of cheap money and global growth.
Attention will soon turn to the new earnings season, with a number of big banks set to report tomorrow. For Monday, eyes will be on Boeing (NYSE:BA) as new Chief Executive David Calhoun takes over at a planemaker struggling to recover from the worldwide grounding of its 737 MAX model series. Additionally, eyes will be on the market reaction to the news that former Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg, who was fired in December, has left the company with $62 million in compensation and pension benefits."

504,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 05:16AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Wirecard's Mini-Bounce Shows Trust Slow to Return,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- German payments company Wirecard enjoyed only a mini-bounce in confidence on Monday after replacing its chairman, suggesting it still has plenty of work to do to regain investor trust after allegations about its accounting practices.
Shares in the company recovered only 1.9% to 112.83 euros by 5:15 AM ET (10:15 GMT), in response to an announcement on Friday that long-serving chairman Wulf Matthias will step down with immediate effect “for personal reasons”. He’ll be replaced by Thomas Eichelmann, who joined the supervisory board as an independent director midway through last year. Matthias will continue to serve on the board until his contract expires next year.
The move suggests that management is belatedly taking a more constructive approach to addressing concerns about its historic accounting practices, which have been attacked in a series of disclosures by the Financial Times over the last two years. The FT’s findings suggest the company used various tactics to inflate its sales and profits – suggestions that the company denies.
Wirecard ultimately commissioned an independent review into its accounting by KPMG in October, only days after Matthias had said that such a step was unnecessary. The FT reported that Eichelmann had been instrumental in securing an independent review.
The outcome of the KPMG review is likely to have a big impact on the company’s shares. Wirecard was a darling of retail investors during the period of its fastest growth, and its inclusion in the benchmark DAX index made it a must-hold for thousands of institutional accounts. However, investor confidence in the company has been shaken not just by the allegations themselves, but also by the company’s apparent recalcitrance in addressing them.
Wirecard repeatedly accused the FT of being in league with short-sellers, who have increasingly targeted the stock. Some 6.5% of the company’s free float stock was sold short as of the end of last year, according to data compiled by Shortsqueeze.com.
The shares are currently 41% below their all-time high, posted in September 2018, when its market capitalization briefly exceeded that of   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn). However, the shares still look expensive by some metrics, with its market value at over 5.6 times the last 12 months’ revenue and its enterprise value 15 times the management’s forecast for next year’s EBITDA.
Wirecard was the best-performing stock in the DAX on Monday on a day still overshadowed by the weak U.S. labor market report on Friday. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.1% at 419.48, while the FTSE 100 was up 0.5%, thanks largely to hopes of a rate cut from the Bank of England, which weighed on sterling."
505,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 03:36AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Opens Higher as Macro Backdrop Improves,"Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher at the open Monday, continuing the positive tone seen on Wall Street for most of last week as attention turned away from tensions in the Middle East and back towards global growth.
Germany’s DAX was up 0.2% by 03:30 PM ET (08:30 GMT), while the CAC 40 in France gained 0.2%. In the U.K., the FTSE 100 traded 0.4% higher, due in part to a further fall in sterling after another Bank of England policymaker added his voice to calls for an interest rate cut in an interview at the weekend.
Among the biggest gainers were German payments company Wirecard (DE:WDIG), which rose 2.8% after its chairman stepped down to make way for an independent director who has strongly supported an independent review into allegations about its accounting practices. At the bottom of the table was French carmaker   Renault   (PA:RENA), which fell 2.6% after a report saying that Nissan (T:7201) is planning to loosen or even break up the companies' long-standing alliance. 
The U.S. and China are expected to sign the long awaited phase one trade deal at the White House on Wednesday. This should allow the world’s two largest economies to move on from a trade war that has troubled the financial markets and hindered economic growth for the past 18 months.
Under the terms of the accord, Beijing will increase imports from the U.S. in exchange for the suspension of the December tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. and a partial rollback of some existing tariffs.
Economic data of note this session includes the release of U.K. monthly gross domestic product numbers for November. This is expected to be flat on the month, but there could be downside risk given the downbeat statement from the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney towards the end of last week."

Shares rose in Seoul and Hong Kong, reversed losses in Shanghai and slipped in Sydney. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday. European futures were little changed, while U.S. futures gained after the S&P 500 dropped from record levels Friday with the latest jobs report delivering mixed signals on the strength of the economy. The yen and gold retreated. The offshore yuan rose past 6.9 per dollar for the first time since July.
Geopolitics remained on the radar over the weekend, with Iran admitting it downed a Ukrainian jet after mistaking it for a cruise missile. North Korea said it won’t trade its nuclear weapons for a lifting of sanctions. Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen won a landslide victory over a China-friendly challenger to clinch a second term.
In the Philippines, trading in stocks and FX was suspended because the Taal volcano to the south of the capital is belching out ash.
Looking ahead, the U.S. and China are still expected to sign the first phase of their trade deal, which President Donald Trump said will take place on Wednesday.
“Even getting to this phase-one agreement, when we weren’t sure we would get here, really shows that there’s political will to de-escalate trade tensions between China and the U.S.,” Lucy Meagher, investment adviser at Evan’s & Partners Pty., told Bloomberg Television. “We expect that to be a positive and certainly to continue that positive Asia and emerging-markets theme.”
Meanwhile, U.S. earnings season gets underway this week, with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH). and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). among S&P 500 companies reporting in the next several days.

509,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 01:16AM ET</span>",Electric Car Stocks Jump as China Signals Lull in Subsidy Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle makers including Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co. jumped after the government signaled it won’t continue reducing subsidies for the industry at the same pace this year.
Miao Wei, the minister for industry and information technology, told an audience in Beijing on Saturday EV-purchase subsidies won’t be cut July 1, like they were on that date last year.
“Please rest assured. There wont be a further cut on July 1 this year,” Miao said in a speech at an industry forum. The audience, which included representatives from major automakers, was thrilled enough to applaud.
Though the minister later clarified his comments, investors and the industry interpreted his remarks as good news for EV manufacturers that were hit by subsidy reductions last year. Sales of new energy vehicles have dropped for six straight months in China since the government scaled back handouts in July.
A few hours after his speech, the minister’s amended statement was aired on China National Radio and the forum’s organizers asked reporters to refer to those comments.
“In order to stabilize market expectations, and ensure the industry’s sustained development, subsidies on new-energy vehicles will stay relatively stable this year, and they won’t be scaled back significantly,” the radio station quoted the minister as saying.
Shares of BYD and competitor BAIC BluePark New Energy Technology Co. surged by their daily trading limit of 10% Shenzhen and Shanghai, respectively.
The minister didn’t say whether the subsidies will be fully gone by 2021, which is what the government has stated before. Wan Gang, a vice chairman of China’s national advisory body for policy making and an EV pioneer, told the forum that regulators should refrain from making subsidy changes this year so that carmakers can prepare for next year when they will be completely phased out.
China, which began subsidizing EV purchases in 2009 to promote the industry, has been gradually reducing handouts in the past few years to encourage automakers focus on innovating and competing on their own.
Other EV companies competing in China include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., which started delivering locally built electric sedans this month that also qualify for subsidies, and local sport-utility-vehicle maker NIO Inc. Both companies’ shares are traded in the U.S.

“No additional shares are being offered into the market today and the stabilizing manager will not hold any shares in the company as a result of exercise of the over-allotment option.”
Aramco initially raised a then-record $25.6 billion in its IPO in December by selling 3 billion shares.

512,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 12:11AM ET</span>",Taiwan Stocks Rise After Tsai Election Victory Boosts Sentiment,"(Bloomberg) -- The landslide election victory for President Tsai Ing-wen has reinforced a winning run for Taiwan’s financial markets.
Traders on Monday had their first chance to react to the victory of Tsai’s Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party -- which advocates for Taiwan’s formal independence. The Taiex stock benchmark rose as much as 0.6% in early trading, while the local dollar strengthened 0.3% to its highest level since June 2018.
Saturday’s result is helping extend what has been a positive period of investor sentiment toward Taiwan. Stocks have recently touched the highest levels in nearly three decades. Taiwan’s dollar strengthened for an eighth week last week in its longest winning streak since 2013 and government-bond yields remain near all-time lows.
“Investors will pay attention to beneficiary stocks in the short-term,” said Shelly Lee, chairman of Mega International Investment Services Co. “With the upcoming trade deal signing and expectations of Federal Reserve easing, the bullish trend will continue for Taiwan’s markets.”
Taiwan Raises GDP Outlook as Investment Trumps Trade War
If recent history is any guide, Taiwan’s stocks are poised to extend gains in the coming month. The benchmark Taiex index has climbed by an average of 7.4% in the 30 days after the results of the past six presidential elections, as investor concern about political risk fades. This week’s planned signing of an initial trade accord between China and the U.S. is also expected to give a boost.
“Taiwan stocks tend to rise after an election, as uncertainty is removed,” said Li Fang-kuo, chairman of President Capital Management. He sees the Taiex index hitting a record high by April, helped by continued inflows and a strong outlook for Taiwan’s technology sector.
Analysts have turned the most bullish on Taiwan stocks since 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Efforts by the government to lure further capital and incentivize local firms to invest at home have helped Taiwan stay resilient in the face of the U.S.-China trade war. This has helped encourage strong foreign inflows into its technology sector, which in turn have helped boost the Taiwan dollar. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Taiwan’s largest stock, reports earnings later this week.
Money Pours Into Taiwan’s Markets as Election Nears
The local currency is seen rising to 29.5 per U.S. dollar by year-end, driven by the appeal of companies related to 5G and further repatriation of investment, according to Cliff Tan, head of global markets research for East Asia at MUFG Bank Ltd. Government bonds are expected to be boosted by limited supply under Tsai’s leadership, said Kevin Shih, a trader with Jih Sun Securities Co.
Profit-taking pressure may emerge nearer the Lunar New Year holidays, say analysts, while the outcome of the expected trade deal signing and recently heightened Middle East tensions will also be factors.
“But any pull-back would be a good entry point,” said President Capital Management’s Li."

515,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2020 10:54AM ET</span>","As Amazon.com flexes its muscle, Seattle moves to curb corporate political donations","By Gregory Scruggs
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seattle, the Pacific Northwest city where home-grown online retailer Amazon.com has increasingly flexed its political muscle, is expected to approve on Monday legislation banning political contributions by companies with at least 5% foreign ownership.
The move is likely to trigger renewed debate on the legality of corporate donations in U.S. elections while drawing an immediate court challenge.
A six-member committee of Seattle City Council has already unanimously approved the measure, making it almost certain that the full nine-member council will pass it on Monday.
The bill is widely viewed as aimed at reining in political spending from companies such as Amazon.com (O:AMZN). Amazon, Seattle's largest employer, donated a record $1.5 million to back a slate of pro-business candidates in the November council elections - a campaign that was largely unsuccessful.
At least 9% of Amazon’s stock is owned by foreign investors, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. 
A spokesman for Amazon, which has been butting heads with the city for two years over attempts to levy more taxes on the company, declined to comment.
“What they are proposing is likely an unconstitutional backdoor ban on U.S. companies speaking about local elections,” Jim Manley, an attorney with the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, told Reuters.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling struck down limits on political contributions by corporations or unions. Companies and unions may not give money directly to campaigns but may spend unlimited amounts on ads and other means.
The legislation before the Seattle City Council says that companies that have at least 5% of their shares held by foreigners, or 1% by a single foreigner, are subject to foreign influence and therefore cannot participate in elections. 
Amazon's $1.5 million political donation for Seattle's November elections represented more than half of the nearly $2.7 million raised by a Super Pac for those elections. Four years ago, Amazon donated $25,000.
Super Pacs may accept unlimited contributions from any non-foreign source.
Amazon began to prominently flex its political muscle in May 2018 when the Seattle council approved an employee ""head tax"" on the city's largest companies, in order to combat a housing crisis. Just four weeks later, the City Council repealed the tax after a coalition of businesses, with Amazon at the forefront, mounted a well-financed campaign for a referendum to repeal the tax. 
Seattle is not the first city to take aim at campaign spending. St. Petersburg, Florida, approved a similar ordinance on foreign-influenced corporations in 2017 that has not yet been challenged in court.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2020 10:04AM ET</span>",Peugeot family aims to quickly raise PSA-Fiat Chrysler stake: newspaper interview,"PARIS (Reuters) - The  Peugeot  family, which will own a 6.2% stake in the new carmaker resulting from PSA (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  Chrysler's (MI:FCHA) merger, aims to increase its holding as soon as possible, a representative said in a newspaper interview.
PSA and Fiat Chrysler reached a binding agreement last month on a $50 billion tie-up that will create the world's No. 4 carmaker after the deal is completed in 12-15 months.
Under the terms of the deal, the Peugeot family can increase its shareholding by up to 2.5% only by acquiring shares from French state investment bank Bpifrance Participations and China's Dongfeng Motors, which are both also PSA shareholders.
Asked by regional French newspaper L'Est Republicain if raising the stake was a major objective, Jean-Philippe Peugeot, who heads the family's Etablissements Peugeot Freres holding company, replied that it was.
""There was a complex negotiation in order to obtain this possibility. It wasn't necessarily a foregone conclusion. Once the merger is complete, my family will give favorable signals,"" Peugeot told the newspaper.
A PSA spokesman told Reuters that Peugeot's remarks were ""in line with what had been indicated"" when the deal signed. FCA declined to comment.
Peugeot also said that he expected the French state, represented through Bpifrance, to eventually exit the new company.
""I think that it is not meant to be there forever. It will undoubtedly remain long enough to make sure that (French) jobs are safe over time,"" he said.
However, he added that it was unlikely that Dongfeng would totally sell out of the new group even though it plans to reduce its shares in PSA.
""Partially, perhaps, but I don't think all of it. Sure, PSA's business in China has not met our expectations, but for Dongfeng it's a minor issue when you look at China's long history,"" he said."

518,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2020 09:13AM ET</span>",Pressure for 2020 as U.S. companies report end of weak profit year,"By Caroline Valetkevitch and Noel Randewich
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As major U.S. corporations prepare to close the books on a lackluster year of profit growth, they may need to shore up confidence that 2020 will show significant improvement to keep the stock market's rally going.
Wall Street surged to record highs last week, partly reflecting growing hopes for a resolution to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff war with China.
Investors are anxious to find out whether that will bolster the case for a pickup in earnings growth after the S&P 500's (SPX) 29% gain in 2019 occurred despite anemic profit growth in the first three quarters.
Fourth-quarter S&P 500 earnings are expected to have declined 0.6% year-over-year, which would mark the second straight quarterly decline, or a profit recession, the last of which occurred in 2015-2016. Yet, earnings are seen climbing about 10% in 2020, and strategists say that growth is needed to sustain Wall Street's rally.
""If the outlook we're getting for 2020 is similar (to 2019), maybe we will hit a point where investors decide to take a pause,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. ""But we'll need several large companies to indicate some type of slowing.""
(Graphic: S&P 500 earnings by quarter since 2015 link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-RESULTS-OUTLOOK/0H001QXTVB9F/eikon.png)
With JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM),  Citigroup  (N:C) and other big banks kicking off the fourth-quarter reporting season this week, investors are likely to focus less on recent earnings and more on corporate outlooks for 2020 in light of Trump's so-called Phase 1 trade deal, which is scheduled to be signed this week.
Investors got a potential early preview on Monday, when semiconductor industry bellwether Microchip Technology (O:MCHP) said it believes the December quarter represented the bottom of a downturn it has been suffering, ""barring any negative developments on the U.S./China trade front or unexpected fallout from geopolitical events.""
That has helped push the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) up 0.7% last week after surging 60% last year.
If most companies end up beating analysts' earnings forecasts, as often happens, the S&P 500 could end up posting a small profit gain for the fourth quarter.
Still, the stock market's strong performance, also super-charged by expectations of continued low interest rates, has stretched earnings multiples.
""We better enter 2020 with a running head start on earnings because there certainly was not much last year,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago.
""Given that we are not going to get much P/E expansion this year – we can't do that twice in a row unless we continue to slash rates – we are going to need to see outlooks improve.""
The benchmark index is trading at the equivalent of 18 times earnings expected over the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv's Datastream. That is up from a forward earnings multiple of 16 in early October and roughly 14 at the end of 2018.
After surging 50% in the past 12 months, the S&P 500 technology sector (SPLRCT) has a PE above 21, up from 19 in early October. Tech led gains among sectors last year.
""We still don't have the profits to subtantiate the market's recent performance. But if we get more chip companies coming out and saying that things are getting better, that would be huge,"" said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager who specializes in tech stocks at Synovus Trust in Atlanta.
(Graphic: Earnings optimism is rising, along with Wall Street link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/878/876/Market%20PEs.jpg)
Tariffs imposed on imports from China and other trading partners have cost U.S. companies $46 billion since February 2018, and U.S. exports of goods hit by retaliatory tariffs have fallen sharply, according to an analysis of Commerce Department data.
Strategists say uncertainty about the trade situation has caused some companies to be cautious with their big investments in buildings and equipment.
S&P 500 capital expenditures grew just 3.3% in the third quarter of 2019 versus the year-ago quarter, and growth is well off the gains in 2018, which was helped by the U.S. tax cut package. The tax cuts also boosted corporate share buybacks to record levels, according to S&P Dow Jones data.
Investors may also be watchful for comments from energy companies on the impact of recent tensions between the United States and Iran, which caused a brief jump in oil prices.
Energy sector earnings are expected to jump 23.8% in 2020 after an estimated drop of 29.4% in 2019."

Aramco initially raised a $25.6 billion, which was itself a record level, in its December IPO by selling 3 billion shares at 32 riyals ($8.53) a share. But it had indicated it could sell additional shares through the over-allotment of shares.
Aramco shares were flat at 35 riyals shortly after the market opened, according to Refinitiv data.
A greenshoe option, or over-allotment, allows companies to issue more shares in an IPO when there is greater demand from participants in the initial offer. Investors were allocated the additional shares during book-building, Aramco said.
""No additional shares are being offered into the market today and the stabilizing manager will not hold any shares in the company as a result of exercise of the over-allotment option,"" Aramco said.
Aramco shares have been volatile amid heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, which lies across the Gulf from Saudi Arabia.
Aramco shares fell to 34 riyals on Jan. 8, its lowest since trading began on Dec. 11, but closed at 35 riyals on Thursday.
Thursday's closing price valued Aramco at $1.87 trillion, above the IPO price but below Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's coveted $2 trillion target for the IPO."

Central Huijin Investment Ltd [SASAWH.UL], an investment arm of country's sovereign fund, China Investment Corp (CIC), purchased 60 billion yuan of shares in the sale, and Shandong Financial Asset Management, a local government-backed financial asset management firm purchased 36 billion yuan of shares.
Singapore's United Overseas Bank (SI:UOBH) and other investors bought the remaining 4 billion yuan in shares, it added.
Concerns over Hengfeng were rekindled last year by the state seizure of Baoshang Bank, and the state rescue of Bank of Jinzhou, which sharpened concerns about the health of hundreds of small lenders as China's economic growth slows to near 30-year lows."
522,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 12, 2020 01:36AM ET</span>",Treasury Bulls’ Swagger Undiminished as Focus Shifts to Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond investors may get a chance next week to contemplate the soft spots in the U.S. economy rather than a geopolitical precipice. Either way, Treasury bulls have little to fear.
For now, haven buying of government debt has subsided as the U.S. and Iran appear to have backed away from escalating their conflict. The 10-year Treasury yield, the world’s borrowing benchmark, is around 1.82% -- the midpoint of its roughly 20-basis-point range this month. Yields sank on Friday, with the trigger coming from weaker-than-expected American jobs data.
The coming week features the signing of the so-called phase one of a U.S.-China trade deal and the expected beginning of President Donald Trump’s Senate impeachment trial. Both are unfinished business, but they may not have much market-moving potential. That puts the spotlight on economic news, even the best of which -- such as strong services-sector figures -- hasn’t done much to roil Treasuries lately. Next up: inflation data and an update on retail sales.
“The market has increasingly come around to the view that some of the forces that have pulled down rates in other developed markets have been at work in the U.S. as well,” said Steven Friedman, senior macroeconomist at MacKay Shields LLC. “So any backup in yields could certainly see buying interest.”
Concern over the growth outlook has dissipated since trade-war anxiety peaked in early September, but Treasuries still seem more sensitive to disappointing data than to positive surprises. Ten-year yields fell about 3 basis points Friday after the U.S. jobs report, and Friedman said lackluster wage growth was the driving force.
In his view, the next crop of price indexes poses little threat to yields at these levels, given that the Federal Reserve has signaled it will take a pretty profound swing in the inflation trend to shift to a more hawkish stance.
“It’s becoming increasingly clear just how patient the FOMC is going to be when it comes to inflation,” Friedman said. “They want to see a sustained and meaningful pickup in inflation before they would consider raising rates.”
Consumer prices are expected to have risen at a 2.4% annual clip in December. While that would be the fastest pace in more than a year, the Fed’s preferred gauge is still running well below its 2% target.
Friedman said market expectations for inflation over the longer term are likely to remain low until the Fed demonstrates it’s prepared to tolerate stronger pressures to make up for a decade of weakness. In his view, that could take another rate cut this year.
“Markets are really in a ‘show-me-the-money’ mood when it comes to inflation,” he said.

“Equity positioning, like the market itself, has run far ahead of current growth asinvestors price in a global growth rebound,” strategists Parag Thatte, Srineel Jalagani and Binky Chadha wrote in a note Friday. It “is now in the 96th percentile on our consolidated measure, with a wide variety of metrics very stretched.“
Systematic strategies have raised equity exposure to the top of their ranges -- to where the only time it was higher was in January 2018, prior to the large February sell-off, the strategists said. In addition, discretionary investors are now “clearly overweight” at the highest levels since October 2018, and equity futures long positioning for asset managers and leveraged funds combined is near record highs, they said.
The S&P 500 is up 1.1% already year-to-date and closed at a fresh record on Thursday, shrugging off geopolitical concerns as U.S.-Iran tensions soared. That comes after the benchmark soared 29% in 2019, its best performance since 2013, as central bank policy generally supported markets and the global economy appeared to be coming out of a soft patch.
Chadha is relatively bearish among strategists tracked by Bloomberg, expecting the S&P 500 to end 2020 at 3,250 versus Friday’s close at 3,265. That’s notable in two respects: One, because it’s a turnaround from 2019, when his prediction was the most bullish on the Street; and two, because he was the most accurate last year, as the gauge closed out the year at 3,231.

524,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 11, 2020 04:59AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.

1. BofA Hails Citi as ‘Pick of the Decade’
Bold calls in the world of investing can leave many with egg on their face. But Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) turned heads earlier this week when it hailed rival bank   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) as its ""pick of the decade.""

Bank of America is betting big that Citi's U.S. consumer business will start churning out the growth required to match that of its rivals in the coming year, boosting its stock valuation, which has traded at a discount for years.
Its consumer business has lagged behind rivals in terms of profitability and share of deposits. But that weakness has been much of its own doing as Citi was the one big bank not expand its deposit rates during the financial crisis.
The bank has since plotted a course to turn around its U.S. consumer business.
In August 2018, it announced a string of changes at the top within its global consumer banking division and moved to a regional model, replicating a formula that worked well in its businesses in Asia and Mexico.
In the ensuing months, further management changes followed, and the bank streamlined its businesses, overhauling its investment and stock trading operations.

The bank has also zoned in on its U.S. credit card business, which accounts for the bulk of its global consumer banking revenue, to grow deposits by promoting its checking and savings accounts to card holders.
These ""sweeping management changes"" combined with continued efficiency initiatives will drive consistent improvement in return on equity, and end the stock's longtime valuation discount, BofA said.
The bold claim is not without merit.
Citi reported higher-than-expected earnings in the third quarter, with a return on tangible common equity – a key measure of profit – of 12.2%, above the goal of 12%.
The earnings beat was led by its global consumer business as north American consumer deposits grew 5% from a year earlier, nearly 2% faster than consumer deposits at Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.

With Citi's fourth-quarter results due as soon as next week, BofA need not wait long for further signs that its pick of the decade is headed in the right direction.

2. Tesla Market Cap Tops GM, Ford (Briefly)
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) did something impressive this week that may or may not have been overshadowed by CEO Elon Musk dancing up a storm at a presentation in China Tuesday (depending on your social media feeds).
The next day the company’s market cap surpassed that of the next-largest, and iconic, U.S. automakers combined.

Tesla shares rose nearly 5% on Wednesday and by the close its market cap was almost $89 billion, more than the market caps of General Motors (NYSE:GM) ($50 billion) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) ($37 billion) combined.

But the electric automaker lost its title by a whisker as the week ended. Tesla closed Friday with a market cap of $86.18 billion.
GM ended with its market cap at $49.51 billion and Ford at $36.68 billion, for a total of $86.19 billion.

Tesla is still ahead of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), which ended Friday valued at $82.69 billion.

But to get to the top valuation, Tesla would need to more than double. Toyota Motor (T:7203) ended Friday with a market cap of $195.23 billion.
Back when Ford went public in 1956, the automaker debuted with a valuation of $3.2 billion, good enough to put it at No. 3 in the Fortune 500, behind top dog Standard Oil and No. 2, GM.

3. Low-Wage Industries Seeing Pay Gains
There was some consternation about the wages information in the December employment report issued by the Labor Department Friday.
For the headline number, average hourly earnings for the month rose 0.1%, which was below economists’ expectations for a rise of 0.3%. On an annual rate, the rise in average hourly earnings edged down to 2.9%, below forecasts for 3.1%.
That can be encouraging for equity investors looking for tame wage inflation to keep the Federal Reserve at bay for 2020 and even longer.
But for those looking at the economy a whole, stagnant wages have been a persistent weak spot in the recovery.
Digging into the December numbers, though, there is a positive.
“Those average wage growth numbers may be rough, but the decline seems to be concentrated in higher-wage industries,” Nick Bunker, economist at placement firm Indeed, tweeted. “Wage growth (is) still strongest in low-wage industries.”
Construction and manufacturing both saw average hourly earnings rise in December from November, while financial activities saw a dip."
525,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 08:02PM ET</span>","Alphabet legal head Drummond exits, giving its new CEO chance to shake up team","By Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Alphabet's new Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on Friday gained the opportunity to reshape the leadership of Google's parent with the exit of Chief Legal Officer David Drummond, whose outsized strategic role was overshadowed by employee concerns about his personal relationship with a subordinate.
Drummond, also senior vice president of corporate development, had been with Google since its start in 1998. He incorporated the company as outside counsel, winning the business of co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He later spent nearly 18 years as the company's top lawyer and one of its few black executives.
Scrutiny centered on Drummond as the board last year investigated the company's handling of sexual misconduct complaints throughout its workforce, and he became a lightning rod for criticism about what some employees viewed as tolerance for poor behavior. 
Pichai now has his first big chance to make his mark on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) leadership since Page and Brin left him day-to-day reins of the company last month.
Drummond's last day is Jan. 31, and a replacement has not been decided yet, Alphabet said.
""With Larry and Sergey now leaving their executive roles at Alphabet, the company is entering an exciting new phase, and I believe that it’s also the right time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders,"" Drummond said in an email to employees shared by Google. 
Some employees had questioned Drummond's role at the company after the New York Times in 2018 reported on an extramarital affair he had with subordinate, Jennifer Blakely, starting in 2004. She told the paper that she was effectively forced to transfer teams to comply with Google's workplace dating policy. 
Blakely had a son with Drummond, but in August 2019 she publicly criticized him for not providing support. Drummond responded in a statement calling himself ""far from perfect."" Blakely did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Some shareholders have urged Alphabet to make changes that had been within Drummond's purview, including greater financial transparency, bigger share buybacks and a management shakeup. Alphabet shares have risen 6.5% this month as analysts expressed optimism about possible changes.
In a departure from company norm, Drummond is not receiving an exit pay package. In recent weeks, Drummond sold more than $200 million worth of his Alphabet shares, leaving him with about $90 million in company stock.
He remains a defendant, alongside other executives, in a lawsuit shareholders brought last year accusing Alphabet leadership of covering up sexual harassment scandals within the company including by awarding lavish exit packages to two top executives found responsible for misconduct.
""While we are glad to see Mr. Drummond is no longer with Alphabet, we still intend to hold him accountable for fiduciary breaches through our litigation,"" said Julie Goldsmith Reiser, attorney for the lead plaintiffs.
The board completed an internal investigation last month, but has not publicized findings. The litigation is in mediation, and the board's findings and resulting actions may become known as it goes on.
Pichai in 2018 said Google made mistakes in some cases and introduced new procedures aimed at creating equity and transparency in harassment investigations. 
""I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society… and, yes, here at Google, too,"" said Pichai, who at the time was Google CEO and had not yet gained the additional title of Alphabet CEO. 
The #MeToo movement has forced major shake-ups in management and harassment policy across corporate America. 
Through blog posts, congressional appearances and media interviews, Drummond's presence was felt in nearly every public battle the company fought as it crippled traditional businesses in media and telecoms on its way to online dominance.
Drummond has described himself as a diversity advocate, telling Fortune in 2017 that he ""pushed"" the company to do more on the issue. He encouraged Google to publish data about the demographics of its workforce, and in 2014 he marched into a companywide meeting and spoke alongside colleagues frustrated by police violence against young black men. 
BIGGER ROLE
When Google re-organized under the Alphabet umbrella in 2015, Page elevated Drummond's role beyond managing the company's legal and regulatory problems to overseeing its investment funds and far-off ventures.
Earlier in his tenure, he beat a lawsuit lodged by insurer Geico that would have undermined the company's now-massive search ads business. He settled with Viacom  a copyright infringement lawsuit that could have crushed YouTube on its way to becoming the top online video destination. And he fended off five major book publishers to enable Google to make their copyrighted works searchable online.
Drummond tussled on behalf of Google with rival  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) for a decade on executive poaching, anticompetitive conduct and patents, with each company taking its share of licks. 
As Google's lead dealmaker, Drummond oversaw billions of dollars' worth of acquisitions including of YouTube, DoubleClick and Motorola (NYSE:MSI). 

Drummond for a time served as the public face of strong stands against governments around the world. He has regularly advocated for freedoms of speech, and in 2010, he called for trade sanctions on countries that censor the internet, such as China and Turkey.

527,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 04:08PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow Reverses Course, Loses 130 After Hitting 29,000","Investing.com – The Dow wiped out gains and ended lower after hitting a historic level in intraday trading Friday, pressured by a downturn in financials as Treasury yields fell sharply on a weaker jobs report.
The S&P 500 lost 0.29%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.27% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.46%. The Dow reversed course after hitting 29,000 for the first time.
The U.S. created 145,000 jobs last month, undershooting economists' forecast of 164,000.
The jobs report also showed weak wage inflation, pressuring Treasury yields, which led to a slump in financials, mostly banks. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) fell about 1%, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ended the day just below the flatline.
Falling U.S. Treasury yields weigh on a bank's ability to generate net interest margin income – the difference between the rates they charge on loans and the rates they pay on deposits and borrowings.
Industrials also played their part in the broad-based decline, partly driven by pressure from   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) and Boeing (NYSE:BA). 
GE fell 2% as JPMorgan reiterated its underweight rating and $5 price target on the stock.
Boeing fell 2% as its reputation continued to come under fire after documents released on Thursday to Congress showed employees raised doubts about 737 Max's ability to fly safely.

The Andean country ordered Uber to cease operations after a judge said it violated competition rules.
Uber said it will use all legal avenues to defend the rights of 2 million users and 88,000 drivers in the country. 
In a statement, Uber also blamed a lack of regulation for ride-hailing apps in Colombia for its exit. 
""Uber was the first company to offer the country an innovative and trustworthy mobility alternative. Today, six years later, Colombia is the first country on the continent to close its doors to the technology,"" the company said. 
Entrepreneurs have said Colombia's regulations are out-dated and may threaten its status as the region's second-most popular destination for entrepreneurial investment after much larger Brazil.
Uber sent a letter this week to the government's legal agency to say it was considering suing under the terms of Colombia's free trade agreement with the United States, a source from the agency said.
A spokesperson for Uber told Reuters the contents of the letter were private. 

The company has also faced regulatory issues in the United States, including a recent measure in California that makes it harder for companies to qualify their workers as contractors rather than employees. Uber has repeatedly said that its drivers are properly classified as contractors.

530,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Aurora Sinks as Analyst Slashes Price Target to $1,"Investing.com – Aurora Cannabis slumped Friday after an investment bank slashed its price target on the cannabis company to just $1 amid concerns about the burning hole in its finances and regulatory hurdles in Germany that had halted sales.
Piper Sandler downgraded its rating on Aurora (NYSE:ACB) to sell from hold and cut its price target on the stock to $1 from $3. Its shares fell 9%.
With a cash deficit of C$200 million ($153.25 million), Aurora is unlikely to find a savior in the debt market as lenders appear unwilling to loosen the purse strings and fund companies in a struggling industry, Piper suggested. That would likely prompt the company to sells shares to plug the gap, further diluting its share price.
It also doesn't help that Aurora's sales are falling short of expectations.
Piper reduced its revenue forecast for Aurora to C$335 million from C$340 million in fiscal 2020. For 2021, the outlook remains hazy, with sales forecast to come in as low as C$440m, compared with an initial estimate of C$635 million.
With revenue in Canada, Aurora's biggest market, forecast to hit a range of 30% to 35%, only ""about half of consensus,"" Piper is worried that future earnings reports will miss expectations, likely leading to more misery for the cannabis company's share price.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Online food ordering company Takeaway.com has won the battle for Britain's Just Eat with a 6.2 billion pound ($8 billion) share offer that will create one of the world's largest meal delivery companies.
Takeaway said that 80.4% of Just Eat shareholders had agreed to its all-share offer, passing a 50% threshold needed to make the offer unconditional.
""I am thrilled,"" Takeaway CEO and founder Jitse Groen said in a statement.
""Just Eat Takeaway.com is a dream combination and I am very much looking forward to leading the company for many years to come.""
Takeaway's bid was worth 906 pence per share at Friday's close. That trumped a rival 800 pence cash bid from tech investment giant Prosus. 
A statement from Prosus CEO Bob van Dijk thanked Just Eat's board and said his company's final offer had been ""appropriate in light of the investment required"" to make Just Eat competitive.
""We have been clear throughout that we would remain disciplined in how we allocate our capital and the price that we would offer,"" he said.
The merged company, which will be led by Takeaway CEO Groen, will have its headquarters in Amsterdam and a listing in London, with 23 subsidiaries mostly in Europe but also in Canada, Australia and Latin America.
Takeaway says the combination will handle orders worth more than rivals including GrubHub, Delivery Hero and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats in a market where China's Meituan is the largest player by volume.
WORK TO BE DONE
While ending a colorful takeover battle, Takeaway's victory starts the difficult task of integrating Just Eat.
As an indication, Takeaway has said the combined company would have had sales of 1.21 billion euros and a loss of 43 million euros on a pro-forma basis in 2018, though both have registered strong sales growth in 2019.
Takeaway says the combination will achieve annual cost savings of about 20 million euros from centralizing orders on its platform, unifying brands and improving procurement.
Prosus, which has investments in delivery services around the globe, including in Germany-based Delivery Hero, may eventually wind up with a consolation prize.
As part of merger plans, Takeaway has said it is likely to sell Just Eat's 33% stake in iFood, Latin America's biggest food site, including its strong Brazilian subsidiary. Prosus controls iFood.
The fight to buy Just Eat began in August when Takeaway struck a management-backed deal that would give Takeaway a 48% stake in the combined company.
That plan was upended when Prosus laid down the first of three unsolicited rival bids in October. All were rejected as inadequate by Just Eat managers. 
Prosus argued that Takeaway was underestimating the investment needed to fend off rivals such as Uber Eats and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Takeaway's Groen responded that food delivery was a low-margin business and his focus was on becoming the dominant ordering platform.
The fight reached a dramatic climax on Dec. 19, when Prosus made its final offer and Takeaway responded minutes later with a higher bid, cutting the share of the merged company that will go to its own shareholders to 42.5%.
Takeaway will have to prove that the business model it has pursued in Germany and the Netherlands, which has led to rapid sales growth and improved core earnings (EBITDA), will eventually lead to lasting profitability for the group.

(Reuters) - Wall Street hovered near all-time highs on Friday, as easing Middle East tensions and technology stocks offset concerns about slower-than-expected U.S. jobs growth in December.
U.S. stocks opened at record highs, brushing off government data that showed U.S. jobs increased by 145,000 last month, below the forecast for a 164,000 rise.

Ghosn fled Japan to Lebanon, his childhood home, last month as he awaited trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.
His dramatic escape has raised tensions between Japan and Lebanon, where Ghosn slammed the Japanese justice system at a two-hour news conference on Wednesday, prompting Japan's Justice Minister to launch a rare and forceful public response.
Lebanon has no extradition agreement with Japan.
Serhan said in the statement that he had met with the Japanese ambassador to Lebanon and reaffirmed the importance of the relationship between the two countries.
He also said that Ghosn's wife Carole will also be questioned by Lebanese prosecutors when authorities receive an Interpol notice for her.
""Carole will be subject to the same procedures that were followed for (Carlos) when the red notice was received from Interpol.""
Tokyo prosecutors on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for Carole for alleged perjury related to the misappropriation charge against her husband.
A spokeswoman for Carole said that she had voluntarily returned to Japan nine months ago to answer prosecutors' questions and was free to go without any charges, adding that the warrant was ""pathetic""."

538,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 11:01AM ET</span>",Soaring SUV sales keep carmakers on collision course with climate policy,"By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Soaring demand for SUVs drove record sales for premium carmakers including BMW and Mercedes last year, leaving the industry on collision course with government efforts to tackle global warming despite big investments in electric vehicles. 
BMW (DE:BMWG) said on Friday deliveries by its main luxury brand rose 2% to a record 2,168,516 vehicles last year, thanks to a 21% jump in sales of its ""X"" branded sport-utility vehicles (SUV) which now make up 44% of the BMW brand's global sales.
At Mercedes-Benz, the world's best selling premium car brand, every third luxury car sold last year was an SUV.
Automakers across the world are investing billions in electric vehicles to try to meet tougher emissions regulations. But the jury is out on how many drivers will buy them. 
""Consumer preferences for SUVs could offset the benefits from electric cars,"" the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in its November World Energy Outlook 2019 report. 
The IEA said a doubling in market share had seen emissions from SUVs grow by nearly 0.55 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) during the last decade to roughly 0.7 gigatons. 
As a result, SUVs were the second-largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions since 2010 after the power sector - ahead of heavy industry including iron and steel, cement, aluminium, as well as trucks and aviation, it said.
There are now more than 200 million SUVs around the world, up from about 35 million in 2010, accounting for 60% of the increase in the global car fleet since 2010, IEA data shows. 
""If the popularity of SUVs continues to rise in line with recent trends, this could add another 2 million barrels per day to our projection for 2040 oil demand,"" it said.
The German carmakers say their vehicles are among the most fuel efficient available, thanks to hybrid and other technologies, adding customers could also choose to buy smaller, more frugal cars instead of SUVs. 
Both BMW and Mercedes-owner  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) say they aim to achieve new sales records this year, and are preparing to launch fully electric SUVs - the BMW iX3 and Mercedes-Benz EQC - which they say shows a commitment to a cleaner future. 
EFFICIENCY GAINS
While acknowledging the growing popularity of SUVs, Germany's powerful VDA auto industry association said much of the demand was for more efficient models. 
""Only just under 5% of SUVs are large luxury class vehicles. The market success of the SUV segment is mainly due to the model offensive in compact and medium-sized SUVs, with correspondingly lower fuel consumption,"" VDA said on Thursday. 
The newly registered SUVs of German group brands had reduced their CO2 emissions by 35% since 2008, it added. 
European Union lawmakers agreed in December 2018 that automakers had to cut CO2 emissions from cars by 37.5% by 2030 from 2021 levels, in addition to a 40% cut between 2007 and 2021, or face fines.
Evercore ISI analysts say the average German auto fleet emission is still too high at around 124 grams per kilometre in Europe, compared with the average limit of 95 grams per kilometre for 2020.
""The current CO2 performance is simply not good enough and we continue to flag that carmakers run the risk of facing considerable fines if more is not done,"" they said in a note.
Electric and hybrid vehicles made up only 3.9% of new European sales in the third quarter of 2019.
BMW plans to launch 25 hybrid and electric cars by 2023, with more than 12 models being fully electric versions. 
By 2025, half of all its cars are expected to be hybrid or electric vehicles, it said. 
Mercedes expects half of its sales to be hybrid or electric by 2030, with Europe reaching the 50% mark in 2025.
Peter Fuss, a partner at EY, said German carmakers pushed sales of higher-margin SUVs last year ahead of the introduction of the more stringent European clean air rules in 2020.
In the fourth quarter of 2019 there was an unusually large rise in commercial registrations in Germany, Italy and Britain compared with figures for private consumers, in a sign carmakers were pushing more polluting models into the market.
""We will not see the same growth rates in this segment as we did last year,"" Fuss said.
Electric car registrations are expected to take off in mid 2020, he added. 

But that will depend on drivers being prepared to buy them, and perhaps also on how cheaply manufacturers are prepared to sell them.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR), plans to lay off more than 20% of the workforce at its Wichita-Kansas base as it grapples with halted production and uncertainty over when 737 MAX jets will return to service, according to a company memo seen by Reuters.
The layoffs, amounting to more than 15% of the company's entire workforce, mark the first major 737 MAX-related disruption at one of the world's largest aerospace companies, and signals more pain ahead as the 737 MAX's safety ban ripples across the program's U.S.-centric supply chain.
Cuts of this magnitude also present a major roadblock for Boeing's longer-term plan to ramp up MAX production once it is cleared to resume commercial flights.
The memo from Chief Executive Officer Tom Gentile said the layoffs would affect 2,800 workers at Spirit's marquee facility in Wichita, with the possibility of more to follow based on what final production rates are agreed with Boeing.
Spirit has some 13,000 employees in Wichita, out of 18,000 total worldwide.
Spirit builds the fuselage, thrust reversers, engine pylons and wing components on the 737 MAX - with the program accounting for more than 50% of its more than $7 billion annual revenue, according to its website.
""Spirit has not yet received notice from Boeing on when MAX production will restart or what production rates will be when it does,"" Gentile said in the memo to employees.
""We are taking these actions to align our cost structure to what we expect will be lower production rates than Spirit’s 2019 levels.""
He added that ""additional workforce actions"" were possible.
Previously Boeing's best-selling plane, the 737 MAX has been grounded since March, following two fatal crashes in five months that killed 346 people, hurling the world's largest planemaker into crisis.
The news of the layoffs comes just days after Spirit said it would offer voluntary layoffs to some employees.
Reuters reported last month that furloughs were likely in Kansas if Boeing failed to compensate Spirit for built and stored fuselages after a planned 737 production halt starting this month.
The employees affected include a mix of hourly and salaried employees and managers, though some 737 MAX employees could be transferred to other programs, Gentile said.
Smaller employment reductions at facilities in Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma were also slated for later this month, he said, though the numbers of employees impacted was not immediately clear."

LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's retail and operations director Simon Roberts has emerged as the internal favorite to succeed Mike Coupe as chief executive if the supermarket group opts to promote from within, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Coupe has been at Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Britain's No. 2 supermarket chain, since 2004 and group CEO since July 2014.
Though no timetable has been announced for his departure, he has faced questions about his future since April when Britain's competition regulator blocked Sainsbury's attempt to take over Walmart (N:WMT) owned rival Asda for 7.3 billion pounds ($9.5 billion).
Coupe was the architect of that deal and Sainsbury's share price has fallen 20% over the last year. Like its big four supermarket rivals, including market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO) and Morrisons (L:MRW), Sainsbury's is continuing to lose market share to German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Despite seeing his grand merger plans thwarted Sainsbury's shareholders overwhelmingly backed Coupe's reappointment in July and the following month, the group reiterated that Coupe had the board's full support. In September, he presented an updated strategy designed to show Sainsbury's could prosper on its own.
Coupe will turn 60 this year.
""Lots of things would point towards it (Coupe's departure) being this year,"" one of the people said.
""The annual general meeting (in July) would make the most logical last day.""
Sainsbury's declined to comment.
Analysts had identified three internal candidates - Roberts, chief financial officer Kevin O'Byrne and food commercial director Paul Mills-Hicks - after the previous frontrunner, Argos boss John Rogers, quit in October to join advertising firm WPP (L:WPP).
Roberts has since emerged as the clear internal favorite, though good corporate governance dictates that Chairman Martin Scicluna would also conduct a thorough external search process, the people said.
Roberts joined Sainsbury's in July 2017 as central retail and operations director responsible for stores, central operation and logistics.
Before that he was executive vice president of Walgreens Boots Alliance (O:WBA) and president of health and beauty retailer Boots. Prior to this Roberts was managing director of Boots UK, where he was responsible for leading retail and pharmacy activities in over 2,500 stores across the UK and Ireland.
Earlier in his career Roberts spent 14 years at Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), where he had roles in stores and operations.
If he does get the job it will mean Britain's two biggest supermarket groups - market leader Tesco and Sainsbury's - will be run by Boots alumni.
Ken Murphy, a former joint chief operating officer at Boots UK & Ireland, will succeed Dave Lewis as CEO of Tesco in the summer.
Sainsbury's updated on Christmas sales on Wednesday. Core sales slipped as a drop in demand for toys and gaming eclipsed a solid performance in food.

It had all the hallmarks of a classic Goldilocks report - not too hot or cold.
Job creation did cool off at the end of the year from a very strong November jump, as expected, but the lower-than-expected rise in nonfarm payrolls still showed decent job creation.
For those keeping score, nonfarm payrolls rose by 145,000 last month, compared with expectations for a rise of 164,000 according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
November payroll growth was revised down to 256,000 from 266,000 and Ocober’s payroll riser was revised down to 152,000 from 156,000.
“Two facts that are useful (because each upsets someone's talking point),” University of Michigan Economic Professor Justin Wolfers tweeted. “1. It's stunning that the recovery has continued this long, this strong, and this robustly. 2. The rate of job growth today is pretty much the same as it has been for each of the past eight years.”
Meanwhile average hourly earnings rose less than expected, up 0.1% for December and 2.9% year on year. That indicates that wage inflation is still not much of a concern and certainly won’t fly onto the radar of the Fed.
So, the job market keeps chugging along without any fear of rate hikes, which look like they could be off the table for the entire year, according to recent remarks from Fed officials
Based on fed funds futures, a rate move isn’t likely until December, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz (DE:ALVG), said the report was balanced by a record low in the more comprehensive U6 employment measure to 6.7% and muted wage growth and flat labor participation.
“In my opinion, the overall net effect of this report is unlikely to change consensus views about the prospects for the #economy and Federal Reserve policy,” El-Erian tweeted.
Looking to the market reaction, the S&P 500 opened slightly below the level it was at before the payrolls report. But a Goldilocks number doesn’t guarantee investors won’t lock in some profits after the news."

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S.-listed online travel giant Ctrip is talking to banks about a planned secondary listing in Hong Kong, putting the group at the head of a queue of Chinese companies expected to follow  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) in establishing an investor base closer to China.
Ctrip, also known as Trip.com Group Ltd, has approached China International Capital Corp, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) for its planned share sale in Hong Kong, said four people with knowledge of the matter.
Ctrip, which had declined to comment earlier, late on Friday said: ""The specific details of the listing reported are not true. The company does not have plans yet for a secondary listing.""
No banks have been mandated, and more banks may be involved, the sources said. 
CICC, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
China's largest online travel firm looks to sell at least 10% of its shares as early as the first half of the year, said two of the people who declined to be named as the information was private.
Based on Ctrip's latest market value of $20.6 billion on Nasdaq, that would help it to raise at least $2 billion. But the sources said the deal was still in the early stages and the details were subject to change. 
The move comes weeks after the successful $12.9 billion secondary listing of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group in Hong Kong in November, which was the city's largest deal since 2010 and the world's biggest ever cross-border secondary listing. 
Charles Li, chief executive of bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, said this week at a Reuters BreakingViews event that he was confident more U.S.-listed companies would follow Alibaba.
""I think just by their nature they will come, because their customers know them and they will potentially get a better valuation re-rate if your customer know your business and wants to become your shareholder,"" he said, noting too that adding Chinese shareholders could help to balance U.S. investor views. 
""A different shareholder base means that you are hedged because the Chinese are going to look at the world very differently from the western investors and as a company you want people to have different views,"" he added. 
Co-founded in 1999 by Chinese businessman Liang Jianzhang, Ctrip first went public on Nasdaq in 2003, as part of an early wave of Chinese tech companies lured by high valuations overseas, at a time when domestic markets were a fraction of their current size.
Both the HKEX and its mainland Chinese counterparts have been trying to coax such companies to their home markets to give Chinese investors access to these fast-growing businesses that have traditionally opted to list in New York.
Apart from Ctrip, U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies, including NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), have also had preliminary discussions with the HKEX about the possibility of a secondary listing in the city, said a separate person with direct knowledge of the matter. 

Baidu and the HKEX declined to comment. NetEase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Swiss company said it was reducing the workforce at the small transformers plant in South Boston, Virginia, by 113 workers, citing a downturn in global demand.
The site, part of the power grids division which ABB is selling to Hitachi (T:6501) in a $11 billion deal, employed a total of 467 people.
""The remaining 75 percent of the local workforce will continue to contribute to the future production of transformers used in the power industry,"" a spokesman said.
""ABB has taken this decision to become a leaner and more competitive organization in South Boston.""
An ABB U.S. spokesman told South Boston News & Record the cuts were due to a global slowdown in demand for transformers.
ABB has been cutting jobs in recent months, mainly at its headquarters, as it aims to reorganize its business after years of underperformance. When the deal to sell the Power Grids business was announced in December 2018, ABB launched a $500 million restructuring project.
The company said the South Boston cuts were not related to the divestment of ABB Power Grids' business to Hitachi, which is expected to close in the first half of 2020."

LONDON (Reuters) - Local government pension schemes in Britain pulled money out of hedge funds last year, shifting cash to infrastructure projects such as wind farms and to private equity, a Reuters analysis of annual reports shows.
Local government schemes, which are among the largest pension investors in Britain, slashed their investments in hedge funds by a third in 2019, amid concern about low returns and high fees, the analysis shows.
The drop reflects a difficult year for hedge funds, with $65.86 billion yanked by investors globally in the year to March 2019 amid flat returns, according to data from eVestment. The FTSE 100 index (FTSE) rose 3.7% over the same period.
Hedge fund investments at the 10 largest local government pension schemes in England and Wales, which together manage 108.7 billion pounds ($141.92 billion), fell to 854.3 million pounds from 1.3 billion pounds, in the 12 months to end-March 2019.
The top 10 local government schemes are collectively bigger than any scheme run by a major private company or university in Britain, providing a key window on the strategy of UK pension managers.
It was the second year in a row that the UK schemes have pulled money from hedge funds, the Reuters analysis showed.
""Hedge funds have come under the spotlight in two areas in the last few years,"" said Colin Cartwright, partner with Aon (NYSE:AON) Hewitt's Global Investment Practice. ""Performance, when you compare them with equity markets has not been great... and a greater focus on fund management fees.""
Hedge funds typically charge both a management and performance fee.
By contrast, the pension plans added 958.6 million pounds to infrastructure investments, an increase of 24% from last year, including to projects such as Clyde Wind Farm in Scotland, one of Europe's largest operational windfarms.
Groups of local government pension schemes (LGPS) have started to pool their assets into large funds following rule changes in 2015, designed in part to boost their investments in infrastructure. The ruling Conservative party has also said it wants to spend more on infrastructure, particularly in the north of England.
Investments in private equity, which have long been favored over hedge funds, also rose by 597 million pounds, a 10.4% gain.
For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2QZM3ma.
Pension funds are important investors because they tend to park their money for the long term, and public pension funds account for about a fifth of hedge fund assets globally.
Hedge funds are often perceived as riskier investments and government-run funds, such as these pensions, generally face pressure to stick to more staid places to put their money.
However, one of the top 10 LGPS, Kent, which did not invest in hedge funds but does invest in private equity, came under fire last year for its additional exposure to unlisted stocks via the now-closed Woodford Equity Income Fund.
Of the five LGPS schemes to invest in hedge funds, three said they had cut back, including South Yorkshire, which continued to reduce its allocation to U.S.-based Permal Group, while one suffered losses.
Lancashire's hedge funds investments dropped 14% to 372.7 million pounds, but they declined to disclose whether they had redeemed cash or suffered losses as a result of poor performance.
Since March 2019, though, hedge fund returns have picked up, and a source at one LGPS said it has increased its hedge fund allocation.
The hedge fund industry made a 4.6% return between the end of March and the end of December, according to data from Hedge Fund Research, outperforming the FTSE 100, which rose 3.6%.
""Given the current environment, we would counsel investors to exercise a degree of caution in drawing too many conclusions on whether to switch out of hedge funds,"" said Benjamin Cooper, head of manager research at investment consultant Cardano."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government plans to push the central bank for a fiscal lifeline in the form of another interim dividend, as it struggles to meet its expenditure commitments amid a steep revenue shortfall, three sources directly aware of the matter said.
The fresh call comes just months after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) approved a 1.76 trillion rupees ($24.8 billion) dividend payment to the federal government, including 1.48 trillion rupees for the current fiscal year.
The RBI largely earns profits through its trading of currencies and government bonds. Part of these earnings are set aside by the RBI for its operational and contingency needs while the rest is transferred to the government in the form of dividend.
It earned a surplus of 1.23 trillion rupees in its last financial year, which was substantially higher than previous years.
One of the officials said the government wants the RBI to consider its demand for an interim dividend given this financial year has been an ""exceptional year,"" with economic growth projected to fall to an 11-year low of 5%. The current fiscal year runs to March 31. 
""We do not want to make an RBI interim dividend a regular thing, but this year can be treated as extraordinary,"" said the source, adding the government is likely to push for a payout of between 350 billion and 450 billion rupees ($4.9 to$6.3 billion). 
If agreed, it would mark the third straight year in which the RBI has agreed to give the government an interim dividend. 
Spokesmen for the finance ministry and RBI both declined to comment on the matter.
India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the annual budget for the next fiscal year on Feb. 1, and is widely expected to announce a fiscal stimulus including more spending on infrastructure and tax incentives to boost consumer demand and investments.
Shaktikanta Das, who was appointed RBI governor by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in late 2018 after the resignation of Urjit Patel, has cut the policy repo rate  five times by a total of 135 basis points and eased liquidity restrictions to support falling economic growth.
Some RBI officials are still reluctant to pay more funds as it could impact provisions to cover sovereign risks, sources said, but the government is hopeful that the RBI board, which include its nominees, will approve the dividend.
A panel headed by former RBI governor Bimal Jalan was set up by the RBI in 2018 to recommend a formula for the sharing of its profits with government.
The panel, whose suggestions were accepted, approved a record dividend and has said an interim dividend could be paid only ""under exceptional circumstances.""
""EXCEPTIONAL YEAR""
New Delhi wants the central bank to extend a helping hand as it faces a shortfall of more than one-third in its revenue target of 19.6 trillion rupees ($276.2 billion) following a severe economic slowdown and cut in corporate tax rates last year.
Modi met officials and economists on Thursday, and sought suggestions for the budget and to make India a $5 trillion economy.
The government is worried about an economic slowdown as the manufacturing sector is projected to grow just 2% compared to 6.9% a year ago, hitting tax collections.
RBI officials have been told the revenue shortfall was currently estimated at between 34-37% of the budgeted target, but using all efforts may be brought down to nearly 25%, the first official told Reuters.

""India is facing a serious crisis. We need all steps even to achieve 5.5% to 6% growth next fiscal year.""

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks set new record highs on Friday and the prices of safe-haven assets such as gold pulled back as investors cheered an apparent de-escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions and looked instead toward prospects of improved global growth.
Markets have swiftly reversed the sharp falls seen at the start of the week after the United States killed Iran's most senior general, as investors have concluded that a full-scale military confrontation is unlikely.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, has quickly resumed its rally and added another 0.12% on Friday to hit a new record high. It is almost 1.5% above the lows seen on Monday. 
(Graphic: MSCI World Equity Index click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/856/854/world%20stocks.png) 
European shares also rose, although not quite hitting new records. The pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 (STOXX50E) gained 0.1% and the German DAX (GDAXI) 0.23%, while Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) was unchanged.
The three major share indexes on Wall Street touched new record highs on Thursday, and S&P 500 futures were 0.28% higher (ESc1), pointing to a stronger open ahead of all-important U.S. non-farm payrolls data due at 1330 GMT.
A Reuters poll of economists is forecasting the U.S. economy will have added 164,000 jobs in December, down from 254,000 in November, typically a strong month for hiring. Investors will also be focusing on underlying wage growth data for a gauge of underlying labour market strength.
Stock markets have got off to a decent start in 2019 despite U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to kill military commander Qassem Soleimani, the second most powerful figure in Iran, in a missile strike in Baghdad.
FULL CIRCLE
""In the space of a few days we appear to have swung full circle; with investors seemingly convinced that the problems in the Middle East appear to have settled down, at least for the time being,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets. 
""Investors now have the opportunity to focus on the signing of the new U.S.-China phase one trade deal next week, as well as the health of the U.S. economy today, and in particular the labour market which has continued to look resilient,"" he added.
Adding to the bullish mood, investors welcomed news that sales of Apple's iPhones in China in December jumped more than 18% on the year. They digested the report as a prelude to the upcoming visit by China's Vice Premier Liu He, head of the country's negotiation team in Sino-U.S. trade talks, to Washington next week to sign a trade deal.
MSCI's emerging market currency index (MIEM00000CUS), although little changed on Friday, hit 1-1/2-year highs on Thursday in what is likely to be its sixth straight week of gains. It has also benefited from three U.S. rate cuts last year.
Safe haven assets extended their drop. 
Gold  eased 0.1% to $1,550 per ounce from a seven-year high of $1,610.90 hit right after Iran's missile attack on Wednesday.
Against the Japanese yen, which investors often buy in times of uncertainty, the U.S. dollar strengthened 0.2% to a two-week high of 109.65 yen .
The dollar was slightly firmer (DXY). The euro dropped 0.1% to $1.1085 (EUR=), its lowest in about two weeks.
Oil prices, which briefly spiked at the start of the week on worries that tensions with Iran would disrupt global supplies, recovered some of their subsequent losses. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) rose 0.3% to $65.57 a barrel, and was heading for its first decline in six weeks and its biggest since October, down around 4.5%.
U.S. crude oil (CLc1) rallied 0.22% to $59.69 a barrel but was also on track for its first weekly drop in six, falling 5.3% from last Friday's close.
Government bond yields, which rose on Thursday as investors' nerves about the situation in the Middle East eased, edged lower on Friday.
The benchmark 10-year German bond yield (DE10YT=RR) fell marginally to -0.221% but for the week remains up 6 basis points, in a strong signal of investors' willingness to pull back from safe-haven government debt for riskier assets.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) slipped to 1.852% but it too remains up more than 6 basis points on the week.

""With risk appetite showing little sign of abating following another resurgent 24 hours in markets, the next potential hurdle to jump is the first payrolls Friday of the new decade,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) macro strategists.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 07:29AM ET</span>","'Designed by clowns': Boeing employees ridicule 737 MAX, regulators in internal messages","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has released hundreds of internal messages that contained harshly critical comments about the development of the 737 MAX, including one that said the plane was ""designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys"".
The messages, disclosed on Thursday, show attempts to duck regulatory scrutiny with employees disparaging the plane, the company, the Federal Aviation Administration and foreign aviation regulators. 
In an instant messaging exchange on Feb. 8, 2018 - when the plane was in the air and eight months before the first of two fatal crashes, an employee asks another: ""Would you put your family on a MAX simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn't"". 
The second employee responds: ""No"".
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after an Ethiopian Airlines flight nose-dived, just five months after similar Lion Air crash. The two disasters killed 346.
In particular, some of the communications reveal efforts by Boeing to avoid making pilot simulator training - an expensive and time-consuming process - a requirement for the 737 MAX.
The plane maker just this week changed tack, saying it would recommend pilots do simulator training before they resume flying the 737 MAX - a major shift from its longheld position that computer-based training was sufficient as the plane was similar to its predecessor, the 737 NG.
The release of the messages, which highlight an aggressive cost-cutting culture and disrespect towards the FAA, is set to deepen the crisis at Boeing which is struggling to get its best-selling plane back in the air and restore public confidence.
The FAA said, however, that the messages do not raise new safety concerns although ""the tone and content of some of the language contained in the documents is disappointing"".
Boeing said the communications ""do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable"".
For a factbox on excerpts from employees' messages, click on https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-737max-factbox/factbox-in-boeing-internal-messages-employees-distrust-the-737-max-and-mock-regulators-idUSKBN1Z90NP
PEARLY GATES CLOSED 
The disclosure, which Boeing said was in the interest of transparency with the FAA, prompted renewed outrage from U.S. lawmakers and puts more pressure on Boeing's new CEO David Calhoun to overhaul the company's culture when he takes the reins on Monday.
House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, who has been investigating the MAX, said the messages ""paint a deeply disturbing picture of the lengths Boeing was apparently willing to go to in order to evade scrutiny from regulators, flight crews, and the flying public, even as its own employees were sounding alarms internally.""
Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the commerce committee leading the senate's probe into Boeing, also said the latest documents ""raise questions about the efficacy of FAA's oversight of the certification process.""
The U.S. Justice Department has an active criminal investigation underway into matters related to the 737 MAX plane. 
Some of the messages pointed to problems with the simulators. Boeing said on Thursday it is confident ""all of Boeing's MAX simulators are functioning effectively"" after repeated testing since the messages were written. 
The messages, however, show Boeing in the past was doing all it could to lobby aviation regulators to avoid the need for airlines to train pilots in a simulator on the differences between the 737 MAX and the 737 NG.
""I want to stress the importance of holding firm that there will not be any type of simulator training required to transition from NG to MAX,"" Boeing's 737 chief technical pilot said in a March 2017 email. 
""Boeing will not allow that to happen. We'll go face to face with any regulator who tries to make that a requirement.""
Before the grounding, pilot training on the differences consisted of a one-hour lesson on an iPad and no time in the simulator, according to the union representing pilots at American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL).
Shukor Yusof, the head of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said Boeing should get credit for disclosing the ""destructive diatribes"".
""Initially the flying public will understandably have reservations but the aircraft - having been completely and responsibly resurrected - will likely be one of the safest planes around,"" he said.
In other emails and instant messages, employees spoke of their frustration with the company's culture, complaining about the drive to find the cheapest suppliers and ""impossible schedules"".
""I don't know how to fix these things...it's systemic. It's culture. It's the fact we have a senior leadership team that understand very little about the business and yet are driving us to certain objectives,"" said an employee in an email dated June 2018.
And in a May 2018 message, an unnamed Boeing employee said: ""I still haven't been forgiven by god for the covering up I did last year.""

Without referencing what was covered up, the employee added: ""Cant do it one more time. the Pearly gates will be closed...""

553,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 07:07AM ET</span>","As U.S. election heats up, investors brace for volatility","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. stock market that has weathered trade wars, weak corporate earnings, and now a U.S.-Iran conflict to continually hit record highs faces a new obstacle: the 2020 U.S. election season.
Investors are bracing for more volatility as soon as early February when Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire kick off the primary season. Clues about which candidates will have momentum heading into next month will emerge on Tuesday, when the Democratic Party holds its next presidential debate.
Stocks could retreat if a progressive candidate scores a few early victories or if seemingly more market-friendly moderates, such as former Vice President Joe Biden, fail to register much support.
The market may face political uncertainty for months if it takes a long time to select the Democratic candidate, who would then face a hard-fought race against President Donald Trump before the November election.
""Investors could potentially sit on the sidelines waiting for more clarity around the election,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in Boston.
""It wouldn't surprise me, especially coming off what has been a very solid year in markets, for investors to kind of take a wait-and-see approach,"" Arone added.
After gaining about 29% in 2019, the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) has kept pushing higher, minting fresh record highs on Thursday, as U.S.-Iran tensions appeared to have abated for now.
Some investors still believe Wall Street is ripe for a pullback.
""The domestic calendar for the primary season is going to be a source of volatility,"" said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. ""I think the market will use it as an excuse to come in a little bit and take some heat out of the market and take some of the froth out of the market, depending on some of these outcomes.""
Levine called the elections a ""sleeper issue"" because stocks are pricing in a market-friendly outcome.
Investors said they are weighing scenarios that would be relatively favorable for stocks overall. These include Trump's reelection and victory by a seemingly moderate Democratic candidate such as Biden or former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
But stocks could fall if U.S. senators Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, who are seen as more likely to push for increased regulations in areas such as healthcare and technology, and for wealth taxes, outperform in the primaries.
""The more Joe Biden and other moderates are overtaken by the progressives, I think the market will very gradually begin to price in more headwinds,"" said Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston.
Shares of healthcare companies were pressured last year by worries that Warren and Sanders would push through a government-run Medicare for All. Those fears have eased, but healthcare is one sector likely to face the election spotlight this year, along with technology, financials and energy.
With no strong favorite currently, Trump's Democratic opponent may not be clear by March 3, when more than a dozen states vote on Super Tuesday.
""Uncertainty is never good for the stock market,"" said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, who added that following Super Tuesday, ""you usually know who the candidates are going to be and this time around there's a good chance that you won't.""
Another factor is control of Congress. Trump's Republican party holds the Senate, while Democrats have a grip on the House of Representatives - split control that investors say is relatively market friendly.
But if there is a Democratic wave in November that also flips the Senate, stocks could be hit, investors said, as presidential and congressional control by one party could pave the way for major policy overhauls.
""The most violent reaction would be to a progressive Democrat with the potential for control of Congress,"" Arone said. ""I give that a low probability, but that's what investors are most concerned about."""

Investors may be taking a closer look at some other attractive factors too. A drop off in foreign interest has left the market with a high valuation discount relative to emerging market peers. In addition, Turkey’s status as an oil importer means a post-crisis drop in oil prices may become a positive catalyst. On top of that, some of the country’s largest non-state-owned banks have just announced upbeat guidance for 2020, spurring optimism among money managers this week.
The historically low levels of international ownership compounded Thursday’s rally, spurring sharp gains in the private banking sector, said Julian Rimmer, a trader at Investec Bank Plc in London. The Istanbul benchmark index trades at 6.5 times estimated earnings, compared with a multiple of 13.1 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
Volumes on the day were driven by the local brokerage unit of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and Turkish broker Yatirim Finansman, who were net buyers of 863 million liras ($147 million) of equities in total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The two institutions each made more than double the value of trades done by the third most active on the day. While not a global name, Yatirim Finansman is well known in Istanbul circles through its market-moving algorithmic dealings since 2016 that have caused it to be known by local traders as “the Dude.”
Here are some more views from traders and money managers on patterns during Turkish stocks’ “super Thursday,” and what could be next for the country’s equities:
Julian Rimmer, Investec:
“The rally was to some extent widespread because of the perceived de-escalation in Middle East tensions, but the immediate catalysts for the Turkish out performance were the upbeat forecasts for 2020 from Garanti and Akbank. They were more sanguine than the market on growth, loans and return on equity.”“Given the extent of the institutional underweight in Turkey, the market could easily rise further in the short term before structural impediments reassert themselves.”Can Oksun, head of institutional trading at Global Securities in Istanbul:
“Aggressive foreign buying from a few brokers who are known to be serving some major algo accounts pushed the market higher, supported by improving risk appetite and possible short covering.”“Continuation of this rally largely depends on the mood abroad, but the rally may go on if the benchmark BIST 100 Index in dollar terms can establish a foothold above the key 20,000 points level.”Anastasia Levashova, a fund manager at Blackfriars Asset Management in London:
“No one is interested in a global war; gold and oil is going to go lower in the coming few weeks, so you need to buy assets that will benefit from that, which is Turkey.”The trajectory for the rally is “Hard to tell, but everything else is also not as cheap, so the move should be lower oil and gold, and higher Turkish assets.”Toygun Onaran, head of equity research at Oyak Securities in Istanbul:
“Turkish stocks once again became the sweetheart of investors, as they search for cheaper options benefiting most from the risk-on mood. Turkey’s five-year CDS retreated to 270 levels, the lowest seen since May 2018, on the back of improving macroeconomic dynamics, as well as de-escalating geopolitical risks. Keep in mind that Turkey has underperformed its EM peers by 37% in the last two years.”“Considering the strong earnings outlook in 2020, MSCI Turkey trades with about a 50% discount to MSCI EM, which is significantly higher than last five years average discount of 35%.”“Although there are some tail risks and headwinds ahead of us, we expect Turkish equities to reverse the last two years’ underperformance and narrow the return gap with its EM peers in 2020.”Oyak expects an increase of about 35% in net income for the companies under its coverage in 2020, as they benefit from improving domestic demand and declining financing costs."
555,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Banks’ Record-Breaking Earnings Streak Has Probably Peaked,"(Bloomberg) -- As banks close the books on another lucrative year, investors are looking for signs the era of record profits might have some more life.
Bank stocks are coming off their best year in more than two decades, outpacing the broader market with a 36% surge in 2019. And fourth-quarter profits at the six biggest U.S. lenders, set for release next week, will challenge the record $120 billion set in 2018, according to analysts’ estimates. Strong consumer units and corporate tax cuts are fueling the gains.
But there are warning signs: Estimates for 2020 are for a combined profit drop of $10 billion as global interest rates remain stubbornly low and geopolitical tensions stay high. Chief executives reviewing their results will help clarify whether those kinds of risks are enough to end the good times.
Next week offers “the first look” at 2020 prospects, Jason Goldberg, an analyst at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, said in an interview. “Anything that impacts economic growth tends to influence banks, so whether it’s at home or abroad, corporate and consumer confidence are important.”
Comments by bank chiefs in recent months have been mostly optimistic, but that was before a flare-up in tensions between Iran and the U.S.
Here’s what else to watch when JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) kicks off earnings season on Tuesday:
Capital Markets
On the trading side, revenue will probably increase at least 20% from a year earlier, according to Susan Katzke, an analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. Results will get a boost from comparisons to the last three months of 2018, when market turmoil took a toll on revenue, she said.
Some of the banks’ top executives said as much in December, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak predicting trading revenue would be up “meaningfully,” especially in fixed income.  Citigroup  Inc. CFO Mark Mason said his bank’s trading revenue was set to rise by a percentage in the “high teens.”
Revenue from investment banking will benefit from a strong end to the fourth quarter, when deal announcements picked up and offered “a further affirmation of macro confidence,” according to Katzke. She expects investment-banking revenue to be “flattish on average.”
Piepszak said in December that she also expects fourth-quarter investment-banking revenue to be virtually unchanged from a year earlier, which was a more optimistic estimate than the decline JPMorgan predicted in October.
Interest Rates
Interest-rate whiplash characterized 2019. Banks expected to reap the benefits of higher rates when the year began, and then as the year progressed, the Federal Reserve embarked on a rate-cutting cycle, bringing net interest income -- one of the banks’ main revenue sources -- down as well. Net interest margin, the spread between lending rates and borrowing costs, is expected to have narrowed in the fourth quarter.
The biggest banks’ total net interest income fell in the third quarter for the first time since 2015, and is expected to have dropped again in the last three months of the year. But the decline was probably cushioned by loan growth, according to Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
Consumer Health
Cheap borrowing costs and low unemployment have been bolstering the U.S. consumer for years, to the benefit of banks that lend to them. Retail banking businesses have driven much of the record profits in recent quarters as capital-markets results came in mixed. Bank executives remained optimistic about this part of the economy as recently as last month.
“The consumer is incredibly strong,” JPMorgan’s Piepszak said last month at an industry conference, citing good credit, a strong job market and healthy consumer sentiment.
Expenses
Even after years of cost reductions and job cuts at banks, pressure on revenue means the efforts will continue this year. There’s room for technology spending to moderate, for example, and branch strategies are being tweaked for further savings, according to Richard Ramsden, an analyst at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Investors are also watching headcount after global banks in 2019 announced the most job cuts in four years.   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) planned to do away with 1,500 jobs, or 2% of its workforce, in a year-end efficiency push, people familiar with the matter have said. Last summer,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) started eliminating 400 people from its trading division.
 Wells Fargo  
Charlie Scharf will directly address analysts and investors Tuesday for the first time since taking over as  Wells Fargo  & Company's (NYSE:WFC) chief executive officer in October. Investors are keen to hear what updates he’ll provide on his ongoing review of the company. The firm has taken a beating in recent weeks, with a series of downgrades pushing analysts’ outlook on the bank to its bleakest since the financial crisis."
556,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 06:27AM ET</span>",Wall Street to Continue Higher,"Investing.com - Wall Street is expected to push higher at the open Friday, judging by the U.S. equity futures, as turn their attention away from the potential for conflict in the Middle East and more towards the likelihood of global growth with a trade deal between the U.S. and China.
Futures for the S&P 500 were trading 9 points, or 0.3%, higher by 0700 ET (1200 GMT), futures for the Nasdaq were 39 points, or 0.4%, higher, while the DJI futures contract was up 65 points, or 0.2%.
As fears of major military action in the Middle East dimmed with the governing bodies of both the U.S. and Iran downplaying the recent tensions, investors have been boosted by the news that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s chief trade negotiator will travel to Washington early next week to sign a phase one trade deal with the U.S.. 
The U.S. launched a trade war against Beijing over a year ago over allegations of unfair trade practices. The phase one deal is expected to cut tariffs and boost Chinese purchases of U.S. farm, energy and manufactured goods while addressing some disputes over intellectual property.
That said, investors will also be keeping a wary eye on the release of the official U.S. employment report before the Wall Street open. This economic release has always been watched carefully by the market given the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to consider both inflation and employment growth. 
It is expected to show nonfarm payrolls  rose by 164,000 in December, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The unemployment rate  is seen remaining at 3.5%, while average hourly earnings, an indicator of wage inflation, are forecast to have risen 0.3% for the month."

""This will make it difficult for us to achieve a better (2020) result,"" Rolf Habben Jansen told reporters in Hamburg in comments on the ban on ships using a sulphur content above 0.5% on risk of fines, which is shaking up oil and shipping.
But with above-market growth rates in transport volumes in 2019, Hapag-Lloyd was on a good course with its profits to help offset the extra costs from more expensive fuel and vessel refits, he added.
The company, the world's fifth biggest container liner, will report 2019 earnings on March 20.
It prepared early for the changes, including the staggered introduction of a mechanism to pass on some additional costs for IMO-compliant fuels to customers.
It also modernized its fleet through its purchase of Gulf peer UASC, switching to more efficient vessels, and continues to analyze all technological options to reduce emissions such as scrubbers and switching to ships run on liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Transport volumes probably grew by 1.5% in full year 2019 compared with an assumed moderate global industry growth rate of around 1%, Habben Jansen also said.
Nine-month transport volumes were up by 1.2% year-on-year at 9,011 twenty foot equivalent units (TEU).
Habben Jansen added that the bulk of IMO-related burdens would become evident in first half 2020 while he was optimistic the expansion of transport volumes could continue throughout the year.
He also said that new ship orders could be considered again this year after a long period of restraint.
""We will have to start replacing ships in our fleet from 2022, 2023,"" he said.
This could include ships with up to 23,000 TEU capacity. Currently, its biggest ships can carry 19,000 TEU."

Retail sales stood at 557,706 vehicles in 2019, hit by a 13.5% slump in China, but in the last six months the firm reported double-digit growth in the country, with overall company sales up 1.3% in December.
""2019 was a year of two halves,"" said Chief Commercial Officer Felix Brautigam.
""Over the last six months we saw a marked improvement in China, where intensive work with our retailers, combined with significant process and product improvements are starting to gain traction."" 
At the start of 2019, JLR announced plans to cut around 10% of its workforce and it has been pursuing measures to reduce costs and improve cash flows by 2.5 billion pounds. 
The company, owned by India's Tata Motors (NS:TAMO), returned to the black in the three months to the end of September 2019, posting a 156 million-pound ($204 million) profit.
JLR, like much of the car industry, has also faced the challenge of stepping up investment in zero and low-emissions vehicles as regulations tighten while simultaneously dealing with a drop in demand for some conventionally-powered models. 

It has paired up with BMW (DE:BMWG) to jointly develop electric motors, transmissions and power electronics which should allow it to share some of the high costs of advancing the green technology.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 04:46AM ET</span>",Big broadcasters in India warn new tariff rules could hit services,"By Shilpa Jamkhandikar and Alexandra Ulmer
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Some of the biggest television broadcasters operating in India joined forces on Friday to criticize new government regulations that impose restrictions on pay-TV charges, saying the move could put some channels out of business.
Senior executives from India's Zee Entertainment (NS:ZEE), Viacom18 Media, Sony Corp's (T:6758) local unit, The Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and its TV network Star India, got together to brief the media in Mumbai and said excessive regulation will also crimp their ability to keep up with technological advances.
""We're evaluating how we can challenge this,"" said N.P. Singh, Managing Director and CEO for Sony Pictures Networks India.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) this month ordered direct-to-home and cable operators to double the number of channels they offer by charging a basic ""network capacity fee"" to 200, and capped the charges for additional channels. It also reduced the price ceilings for some channel offerings.
TRAI's decision, which comes in force from March 1, will reduce customers' monthly bills but adversely hit the revenues and profitability of broadcasters, according to the research arm of ratings agency ICRA.
During Friday's event, industry executives also said the regulations will further squeeze India's paid television industry which was already battling intense competition from video streaming firms such as Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon's (O:AMZN) Prime Video.
""The long term effects of this are going to be extremely destructive. I don’t see a case of existence for the smaller channels ... most of them will have to shut shop,"" said Uday Shankar, Star India's chairman.
TRAI's new tariff regulations come less than a year after it first asked broadcasters to price channels individually, rather than grouping them into packages, so as to allow customers to better make selections.
The move, however, was marred by confusion around implementation and forced the TRAI to review the regulations.
TRAI's chairman, R.S. Sharma, has said the new revised regulations announced this month were merely ""fine-tuning"" of the previous ones, and the regulator was open to hearing the industry's grievances.
A government official said TRAI will review the industry's remarks made on Friday before commenting further.
""TRAI's regulatory prescriptions may kill the paid broadcast TV model, impact a large section of the creative ecosystem and compound India's economic troubles,"" said Vivan Sharan, a partner at India's Koan Advisory Group which advises several big media companies.
Television advertising grew at a slower-than-expected rate of 12.4% in fiscal year that ended March 2019, according to global consultants KPMG, as companies have been spending less due to muted consumer sentiment in the country."

(Reuters) - European shares were little changed on Friday ahead of a key payrolls data from the United States, while airline stocks benefited from weak oil prices as tensions in the Middle East faded. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 Index (STOXX) was 0.03% higher by 0907 GMT and was set to post moderate weekly gains. 
The December non-farm payrolls data from the United States is due at 1330 GMT and is expected to have slowed from November, according to a Reuters poll.
The figure is a key gauge of consumer strength and will help determine whether economic expansion in the world's largest economy is chugging along. 
""I would just put (today's movement) down to a bit of profit taking before the figures,"" said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets in London. 
""We've had a good run, up at all-time highs, sentiment is probably positive - the Iranian issue appears to be put to bed - people are just sitting on their hands ahead of the report.""
Travel and leisure stocks (SXTP) were the best performing sector, led by gains in major airline stocks Ryanair (I:RYA) and Air France (PA:AIRF), as oil prices continued to decline. [O/R]
The travel and leisure index touched its highest level since May 2018, and was set to add 1.4% for the week.
On the other hand, the banking sector (SX7P) was the biggest decliner, with Spain's  Bankia  SA (MC:BKIA) leading losses with a 2% dip.
Data showed that industrial production in Spain and France rose more than expected in November, although analysts said that production had a long road ahead to sustained recovery, owing to languid global demand. 
British retailer B&M (L:BMEB) was the worst performer on the STOXX 600 after it flagged weak sales growth in the key Christmas quarter. 
Laggard holiday sales have weighed on British consumer stocks, with updates from fashion brands Superdry (L:SDRY) and Marks And Spencer (L:MKS) also coming in weak.

""We don't discuss the specific numbers yet, but new smart city, newest technology, clean city, with a lot of AI, that's what I'm interested in supporting,"" Son said in comments reported by local media and confirmed by a company spokesman. 
Son's comments came after Luhut Pandjaitan, Indonesia's coordinating minister for maritime resources and investment, told reporters earlier this week the Japanese billionaire was interested in investing in the country's new capital city, which will replace the megacity of Jakarta. 
Son did not outline specific plans to invest in the new capital, which will be constructed on the island of Borneo.
SoftBank's investments in the world's fourth most-populous country include a $2 billion commitment announced in July via portfolio company Grab, Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing firm.
Those funds will be used to promote the use of electric vehicles in Indonesia, which is seen as a priority by the government as it attempts to improve congestion and air quality in traffic-clogged Jakarta.
SoftBank is also working on a smart city project at a township west of Jakarta, which will introduce technology like traffic monitoring cameras, in partnership with property developer PT  Lippo Karawaci  Tbk (JK:LPKR).
The discussions come as SoftBank faces financing pressure on multiple fronts, with the value of key technology investments deteriorating and the group trying to get a second giant tech fund off the ground.

Latin American delivery app Rappi said it is laying off 6% of its workforce, less than a year receiving a nearly $1 billion investment from SoftBank, becoming the latest portfolio company to cut staff to try and boost business performance.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 02:08AM ET</span>",Mediaset seeks shareholder approval to ease pan-European plan,"By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's biggest commercial broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS) has called a shareholder meeting on Friday over governance tweaks needed to ease a pan-European expansion plan which its second-largest investor  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) is fighting in court.
Controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Mediaset (MI:MS) last year approved a plan to merge its businesses in Italy and Spain (MC:TL5) under a Dutch-based company, called MediaForEurope (MFE). The broadcaster wants to use the new entity to pursue tie-ups with European peers to take on competition from streaming apps such as Netflix (O:NFLX) and web giants like Google (O:GOOGL). But French media group Vivendi, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, opposes the plan saying the governance structure of the new entity would strengthen Berlusconi's grip on the company.
In response to Vivendi's legal challenge, a Spanish court has provisionally put the merger on hold, while a decision by a Milan court over the French group's request to suspend the deal is still pending.
To increase the chances the Milan judge will rule in its favor, Mediaset called an extraordinary shareholder meeting for Jan. 10 to approve changes to the bylaws of MFE suggested by the court.
Vivendi however said in a letter to Mediaset's board last month that the proposed changes failed to address its concerns and called for a broader overhaul.
NO TRUCE
Doubts over the future Mediaset's pan-European plan increased after Mediaset and Vivendi failed to resolve their multiple legal disputes, including the one over MFE, with an out-of-the court agreement.
Vivendi and Mediaset have been at odds since the French conglomerate withdrew from a deal to buy Mediaset's pay-TV unit and then built up a 29% stake in the group, which the Italian broadcaster considers hostile.
Two thirds of that stake is held in a trust following a ruling by the Italian telecoms watchdog over Vivendi's excessive presence in the country's media and telecoms sectors given its 24% stake in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT)
The Berlusconi family's holding company, Fininvest, holds 45.8% of Mediaset's voting rights, meaning it will almost certainly get its way on Friday, despite Vivendi's opposition if it bars the trust from voting as it has done in the past.
Mediaset's board will take a decision on whether to exclude the trust ahead of the shareholder meeting. The deadlock with Vivendi is weighing on Mediaset shares, which fell 5.5% in 2019 against a 27% rise in Italy's mid-cap index (FTITLMS).

Investing.com – Japan’s fast fashion retail giant Fast Retailing Co., widely known as Uniqlo’s operator, said it lowered its full-year outlook for operating profit by 11%. 
The company’s shares dropped 3.12% in Tokyo on Friday morning following the news.  
Fast Retailing Co.’s overseas momentum was hurt by the months-long protests in Hong Kong that sometimes turned violent and the trade spat between Japan and South Korea that turned into boycott of Japanese goods.  
The company reported a 3.6% drop in first-quarter sales for Uniqlo’s international segment. Operating profit for the international business also fell 28%, its first quarterly decline in earnings since 2016.  
Korea has the second-largest number of Uniqlo stores after China. Takeshi Okazaki, Chief Financial Officer of Fast Retailing, said the Korean business has continued to decline and there has been a bigger impact on sales. 
“Korea is a very important segment for us, and it’s not clear how long this situation will continue,” he added.  
Fast Retailing has been relying on its strong overseas sales to support its growth, as the Japanese market alone is too weak to support so.  
“The overseas growth comes with higher risk,” Jefferies analyst Mike Allen wrote in a note to investors. “But risk is always difficult to weigh until it hits you in the face.”

SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Latin American delivery startup Rappi said on Thursday it has laid off 6% of its workforce, less than a year after Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984) invested nearly $1 billion in the company.
Rappi did not specify the number of jobs it is cutting. According to the Brazil Journal news outlet, Rappi employs about 5,000 people, which implies the job cuts could affect at least 300 staff. 
The on-demand delivery app said its ""internal leadership team"" made the layoff decision. The firm's board of directors includes a SoftBank representative.
SoftBank has been facing pressure to make Rappi a success following steep losses at two of its other big investments - WeWork and Uber (N:UBER).
Rappi, which has expanded its footprint in nine countries since its founding in 2015, delivers everything from groceries and restaurant meals to medication and furniture, and has branched out into scooter rental, travel and basic banking services. 
""We are in fact actively hiring a large number of people in our areas of focus for 2020,"" the company said in a statement, describing technology as a priority. 
""We are investing heavily in our tech team, automating some roles, re-balancing areas and embracing high performers,"" Rappi said. It did not say how many employees it plans to recruit.
Rappi is also building up a trove of consumer and sales data from millions of users that is highly coveted by consumer brands, restaurants, supermarkets and stores.
Softbank's investment of nearly $1 billion last April made Rappi its biggest bet in Latin America, where the Japanese conglomerate plans to invest nearly $5 billion. 
When asked how soon Rappi would turn in a profit, co-founder Sebastian Mejia told Reuters his priority was to grow fast, and that investors were on board with the plan.

570,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 09:48PM ET</span>",China’s Small-Cap Rally Is Showing a Bullish Sign on Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.
In China’s stock market, a rally in small caps rarely lasts and typically marks the start of excessive risk taking. This time, it’s signaling optimism about the economy.
The outperformance of the ChiNext Index relative to benchmarks of larger companies has already held for six consecutive months, a feat not seen since 2013. It’s continued to start this year.
The advance is partly due to a global risk-on rally sparked by easing trade tensions between China and the U.S. Mainland investors are also hopeful about an economic recovery after some initial signs of stabilization and an easing bias by the central bank. The result has been steady buying of small caps, which are more sensitive to swings in market sentiment given their size.
“It’s an omen, “said Zhu Chaoping, a global market strategist with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. “Investors are pricing in expectations of a mild economic recovery in the first half” of 2020, and “more broad-based gains could be on the way once we see a more favorable economic environment.”
China’s consumer inflation steadied in December after hitting the highest since 2012 the previous month, the latest encouraging economic reading and potentially giving officials room to further ease monetary policy. The People’s Bank of China on New Year’s Day announced a cut to commercial banks’ reserve-requirement ratios, freeing up 800 billion yuan ($115 billion) in funds at a time investors had been expecting support.
Meanwhile, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He plans to sign the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S. next week in Washington.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said China’s upcoming changes to its Securities Law has also contributed to improved sentiment, and Chinese stock gains the past two weeks, strategists led by Laura Wang wrote in a note. The revisions, effective March 1, include efforts to ease listing rules as well as harsher penalties for violations.
To be sure, there might be hints of excessive investor optimism. The ChiNext is up 35% from June’s low and on Thursday notched its highest close since October 2017. The 14-day relative-strength reading for both the ChiNext and the onshore yuan has reached overbought territory, a technical benchmark which raises the potential of a near-term pullback.
The ChiNext was down 0.3% as of 10:20 a.m. Friday amid a morning pullback in Chinese equities.
Small caps are typically a barometer of market sentiment, and extreme rallies in that part of the market previously prompted regulators to take measures to avoid a repeat of 2015’s market crash.
Big start-of-year rallies have occurred for stocks linked to genetically modified crops as well as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., which has started deliveries of locally made vehicles. “Some investors don’t care if the firms will deliver good earnings, so long as they can find the next buyers,” said He Qi, a fund manager with Huatai-PineBridge Fund Management Co. “I don’t think the gains will sustain” for smaller stocks.
Ken Chen, an analyst with KGI Securities Co., disagrees, noting investors have begun moving money out of blue chips and into smaller names. Large caps have been Chinese market outperformers most of the time since 2016.
“Expectations of a recovery in the economy and corporate earnings are starting to become a reality due to an overall monetary-loosening environment and stepped-up efforts to support growth,” said Chen. “Small caps with good growth stories to tell would benefit more.”

571,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 09:38PM ET</span>",California court says truckers exempt from 'gig worker' law,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California's new ""gig worker"" law does not apply to independent truck drivers because they are subject to federal statute, a Los Angeles judge ruled, handing a victory to one industry that is challenging a state effort to clamp down on labor abuses. 
The law, known as AB5 and which took effect on Jan. 1, makes it tougher for companies to classify workers as contractors rather than employees, a classification that exempts them from paying for overtime, healthcare and workers' compensation.
Truckers have mounted the strongest defense against AB5, which is best known for striking at the heart of high-profile ""gig economy"" businesses like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and Postmates Inc, which depend on freelance workers to provide low-cost transportation and deliveries. 
In a decision on Wednesday, Los Angeles Superior Court judge William Highberger said AB5 ""prohibits motor carriers from using independent contractors to provide transportation services"" and therefore is preempted by the Federal Aviation and Administration Authorization Act of 1994.  
Highberger ruled in favor of NFI Industries' Cal Cartage Transportation Express and other trucking companies that were sued by Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer for allegedly misclassifying truck drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.
Feuer said his office would appeal.
""As the Court itself stated, '... there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion,'"" Feuer said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
Highberger's decision came eight days after the California Trucking Association won a temporary restraining order in a separate challenge to AB5. Another hearing in that federal case is scheduled for Jan. 13.
California is home to 450,000 contract workers. Roughly 70,000 of them are independent big-rig owner-operators who transport everything from ocean cargo containers to strawberries. 
""California cannot simply eliminate that business model and force truck drivers to be employees,"" said Gibson Dunn partner Joshua Lipshutz, who represented NFI.

Uber and Postmates on Wednesday asked a federal judge to issue a temporary injunction. They argue that AB5 is unconstitutional because it singles out their workers in violation of equal protection guaranteed under the constitutions of the United States and California.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 09:25PM ET</span>",U.S. agency considering rule reining in non-compete agreements for workers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), one of two agencies that enforce antitrust law, is considering a rule aimed at reining in corporations from pushing employees to sign non-compete agreements that prevent them from working for rival companies, officials said at a workshop on Thursday.
The practice of requiring workers to sign an agreement barring them from quitting for a similar job elsewhere appears to have begun among white collar professions, like doctors and tech workers, and were aimed at protecting trade secrets and encouraging training of workers. They have since spread to low-wage jobs that require minimal training.
A famous non-compete dispute between the Illinois state attorney general and the fast-food franchise Jimmy John's ended in 2016, when the chain agreed not to enforce a prohibition on workers at its sandwich shops taking jobs with competitors. The state had argued the non-compete agreement was illegal.
Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat on the FTC, said she had not prejudged a decision on a rule but seemed skeptical of such agreements.
""We know that non-compete clauses can limit employee mobility and competition even in states where non-compete clauses are legally unenforceable,"" she said at the FTC workshop.
Any decision on a rule limiting corporate non-compete agreements would be made by the agency's five commissioners, three Republicans and two Democrats.
Noah Phillips, a Republican commissioner, also seemed skeptical of non-compete agreements because of their potential to reduce labor mobility. However, he indicated he was reluctant to have the FTC to tackle the issue due to a lack of specific authority from congress or historical precedent for them to do so.
""Some stakeholders are pushing for the FTC itself to address non-competes through a rule-making,"" Phillips said. ""We heard a little less however about the legal basis for doing so. This is a real issue that gives me, someone who is concerned about non-competes, pause.""

A long list of states, including California, limit or ban the agreements. Eighteen state attorneys general, including from California, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York, urged the FTC in July to stop the use of non-compete agreements, as well as agreements between companies to not poach each others' workers.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 09:12PM ET</span>",China's bid to challenge Boeing and Airbus falters,"By Stella Qiu and Tim Hepher
BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) - Development of China’s C919 single-aisle plane, already at least five years behind schedule, is going slower than expected, a dozen people familiar with the program told Reuters, as the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC) struggles with a range of technical issues that have severely restricted test flights. 
Delays are common in complex aerospace programs, but the especially slow progress is a potential embarrassment for China, which has invested heavily in its first serious attempt to break the hold of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus on the global jet market. 
The most recent problem came down to a mathematical error, according to four people with knowledge of the matter. 
COMAC engineers miscalculated the forces that would be placed on the plane's twin engines in flight - known in the industry as loads - and sent inaccurate data to the engine manufacturer, CFM International, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters. As a result, the engine and its housing may both have to be reinforced, the people said, most likely at COMAC’s expense – though another source denied any modification.
That and other technical and structural glitches meant that by early December, after more than two and a half years of flight testing, COMAC had completed less than a fifth of the 4,200 hours in the air that it needs for final approval by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), two people close to the project told Reuters. 
COMAC, which has been developing the C919 largely in secret since 2008, rarely discloses its targets. Company official Yang Yang told Chinese state media in September that he expected certification by the country's regulators in two to three years, without giving any further details. The company's previous publicly stated target was end-2020. Other COMAC officials have said they are aiming for certification and delivery in 2021. 
COMAC did not respond to Reuters requests for comment for this story. CFM, a joint venture between  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), declined comment. 
COMAC has still not finalised the correct calculations and data to send to the engine manufacturer, which are key to ensuring that the engine does not fail under heavy loads, one of the sources told Reuters. Another said load calculations often evolve during development.
But given the uncertainty, there is no guarantee COMAC will meet Yang's 2021-2022 target, people close to the program told Reuters. 
""Things do not always work out as planned, but I hope COMAC would slow down a bit and try not to rush things,"" one of the sources familiar with the engine issue told Reuters. ""Otherwise there will be tons of issues later on."" 
TIME PRESSURE 
The engine miscalculation does not reflect a lack of theoretical understanding - China has been putting people in space for almost two decades. But it does illustrate the national aerospace manufacturer's lack of experience in designing and building commercial aircraft. 
Problems have not been confined to the drawing board. COMAC found cracks in the horizontal stabilizers of some of the first few aircraft built, two sources said, although that problem has now been fixed. It also found a gearbox attached to the engine was vulnerable to cracking, which caused an engine to shut down during a test flight, three sources told Reuters, a problem that potentially affects all six C919 jets now in test flights. 
Regular inspections of the gearbox to check for cracks and leaking oil have curtailed COMAC's flight test program, they said. 
The gearbox problem, discovered in 2018 and not previously reported, was due to unexpected vibrations, two sources told Reuters. Engineers on the program have found ways to minimize the risks, the sources said. 
Unwanted vibration, which in the worst case can shred parts inside an engine, is a problem faced by even long-established aerospace manufacturers. U.S. engine maker Pratt & Whitney revised software due to destructive vibration on some new engines, Reuters reported in October. 
However, the accumulation of problems has put COMAC significantly behind schedule, which could prove costly. 
The C919 is designed to compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus 320neo families. After Boeing and Airbus struck deals to take over production of rival planes made by Embraer and Bombardier, China’s COMAC is now effectively the third option in the market for planes with more than 100 seats. 
Most industry forecasters now expect the prolonged cyclical boom in demand for commercial planes to fade this year, as business confidence wanes amid geopolitical tensions, meaning a plane that debuts in 2021 or 2022 will likely miss out on orders for years to come. 
COMAC is aware of the time pressure. The last three of its six test flight C919s were put into the air for their first flight before the paint job had been completed, sources told Reuters. 
HIGH STAKES 
Beijing made the C919 an integral part of its 'Made in China 2025' initiative, designed to catch up on sophisticated technologies and help the country become self-sufficient. 
The effort has attracted the attention of U.S. federal prosecutors, who in 2018 charged a group of Chinese intelligence officers, hackers and company insiders with breaking into the networks of 13 aerospace manufacturers around the world, including a company whose description matches CFM, in order to steal sensitive data that might help China build a jet engine. China has denied any involvement in hacking. 
Beijing may not be entirely disappointed if the C919 jet fails to compete immediately in international markets, some analysts say, as the Chinese government can direct its own airlines to buy the jet. 
Chinese state-owned carriers and leasing companies account for the vast majority of the 815 provisional orders COMAC says it has received for the C919. The only overseas buyer so far is the leasing company GECAS, owned by General Electric. Few of the orders have been finalized. 

""The C919's real mission is to conquer a domestic market dominated by its two foreign competitors,"" said Jean-François Dufour, chief analyst of DCA Chine-Analyse. ""Ten to 15 years from now, a next-generation C919, or other models developed by COMAC, may become real competitors on the global scene.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Samsung Group, whose leader faces trials over a bribery scandal involving former president Park Geun-hye, has appointed external experts to a new oversight panel to stamp out criminal conduct, the chief of the committee said on Thursday. 
The move came after a judge overseeing Samsung leader Jay Y. Lee's bribery case in October criticized the top conglomerate for its lack of an effective compliance system, saying one was needed to prevent wrongdoing by executives and its leader.
""The timing Samsung chose to make these changes is not that great... and if this committee fails, I will end up hugely disgraced,"" said Kim Ji-hyung, a former supreme court judge named to head the compliance and oversight committee, told a news conference.
""Our committee will thoroughly monitor legal risks at Samsung’s top management,"" he said.
He said he initially turned down Samsung's offer, because of worries it would end up failing to make improvements and only be used by Samsung to secure favorable court rulings. 
He said Lee, Samsung's de facto leader, pledged to guarantee the panel's autonomy at a meeting, adding that it would monitor potential misconduct at group companies, including flagship Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).
Although Samsung Group already has a compliance program in place, the new panel, which will begin work in February, will be run by seven people, mostly outside experts from legal circles and civic groups. 
The compliance panel will comprise seven members, including two from legal circles, two from academia, two from civic groups and one from Samsung Electronics - a former Samsung communications chief. 
Governance experts aired scepticism, calling the move a gesture to get lenient treatment in court and citing a repeat of criminal offences at Samsung and other family-run conglomerates, despite pledges to improve governance and transparency. 
""An effective compliance program could be operated within the environment, encouraging employees to internally report violation without fearing reprisal. But this is not the case at Korean companies,"" said Lee Chang-min, a specialist in corporate governance at Seoul-based Hanyang University.
A South Korean civic group released a statement that the committee is merely an outside advisory group with no legal responsibility, adding that reforms at Samsung's board should be made first. 
The 51-year-old Lee faces charges that he bribed a friend of former president Park to win government favor over succession planning at the conglomerate. 

In August, the Supreme Court overturned an appeals court ruling that had given Lee a suspended jail term, raising the possibility of a tougher sentence and potential return to jail.

Zuckerberg said he plans to work on a new private social platform, decentralized technology, generational issues and new forms of digital governance among others. 
The move would see him focus more on his role as CEO and the problems that have afflicted Facebook instead of personal goals such as learning Mandarin and reading two books a month.
""Rather than having year-to-year challenges, I've tried to think about what I hope the world and my life will look in 2030 so I can make sure I'm focusing on those things,"" he said. 
Zuckerberg, whose company is under pressure for failing to adequately police content and protect user privacy on its platform, said he expects governments to come up with clearer rules for the internet over the next decade.
""Platforms like Facebook have to make tradeoffs on social values we all hold dear - like between free expression and safety, or between privacy and law enforcement, or between creating open systems and locking down data and access,"" he said.
""I don't think private companies should be making so many important decisions that touch on fundamental democratic values.""
Over the next decade, Zuckerberg plans to fund and give a platform to younger entrepreneurs and scientists to cure, prevent and manage diseases. 
He pointed out that while the internet helped people to connect with each other across the world, it also made people crave for intimacy.

""For the next decade, some of the most important social infrastructure will help us reconstruct all kinds of smaller communities to give us that sense of intimacy again,"" he said.

577,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 05:51PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Royal Dutch Shell seeking buyer for Anacortes, Washington refinery: sources","By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Laura Sanicola
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) is looking to sell its oil refinery in Anacortes, Washington, according to three people familiar with the matter.
If completed, this and other asset sales currently underway would reduce Shell's North American refining operations to large plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, said the people, speaking on condition of anonymity as the talks are private.
Oil and gas major Shell has publicly committed to selling more than $5 billion of assets per year in 2019 and 2020. The Netherlands-based company is trying to use its global scale to build a power business as the world moves toward cleaner energy.
The refinery, located north of Seattle, has the ability to process 144,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
This is Shell's third effort to divest a plant in the past year. In June, Shell agreed to sell its Martinez, California, refinery to independent refiner PBF Energy Inc (N:PBF) for up to $1 billion.
The company retained advisers about a year ago to sell its 75,000-bpd Sarnia, Ontario, refinery.
If all three sales are completed, including Anacortes, Shell would operate only three North American refineries: the 340,000-bpd Deer Park, Texas, refinery, a joint venture with Petroleos Mexicanos, and two refineries on the Louisiana coast that together can process almost 500,000 bpd of crude oil.
Shell has also divested refineries in other regions, selling its 50% stake in the SASREF refinery in Saudi Arabia last year."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes registered record closing highs on Thursday as optimism about a U.S.-China trade deal firmed and as Apple and other market heavyweights posted strong gains.
Also helping the market were easing concerns over tensions between the United States and Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump refrained from ordering more military action, and Iran's foreign minister said the missile strikes on Iraqi bases that house U.S. forces had ""concluded"" Tehran's response.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) gained 2.1% on twin support from data showing iPhone sales jumped more than 18% in China in December, as well as a price target hike by Jefferies on expectations of a strong finish to 2019. The S&P 500 technology sector (SPLRCT) rose 1.1%, the top gainer among sectors.
The financial index (SPSY) ended up 0.77% after bullish brokerage comments on  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) ahead of their earnings next week.
On trade, China's commerce ministry said Vice Premier Liu He will sign a Phase 1 deal in Washington next week.
Trump said his administration will start negotiating the Phase 2 trade agreement soon but that he might wait to complete any agreement until after November's presidential election.
""Some of the things that have been worrying the market have gotten pushed to the side of the table,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
But also, he said, ""in the first part of the year, there's always a lot of money that finds its way into the market.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 211.81 points, or 0.74%, to 28,956.9, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 21.65 points, or 0.67%, to 3,274.7 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 74.18 points, or 0.81%, to 9,203.43.
Investors have been closely monitoring tensions between the United States and Iran after the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general last week and Iran's retaliatory measures this week.
Among the day's decliners was the department store operator Kohl's Corp (N:KSS), which slid 6.5% after reporting lower holiday season sales and warning of full-year earnings coming in at the bottom end of an already lowered forecast.
Smaller rival J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) tumbled 10.8% after disappointing same-store sales numbers.
With the fourth-quarter earnings season kicking off next week, analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies to drop 0.6% in their second consecutive quarterly decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

580,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 04:38PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for Jan. 10,"Investing.com – Here are three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Jobs, Jobs, Jobs
The latest employment report will be the headline event before trading begins tomorrow.
With a phase one trade-deal signing between the U.S. and China looking priced in for stocks and Middle East tensions more in the rearview mirror (although that could change at any time) investors seem to be going back to fundamentals.
Economic data this week has been encouraging as the major indexes hit new records.
The Labor Department will issue its December jobs report at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have risen by 164,000, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The unemployment rate is seen remaining at 3.5%, while average hourly earnings, an indicator of wage inflation, are forecast to have risen 0.3% for the month.
2. Oil Rig Count on Tap
Oil trading has also been taking its cue from fundamentals after the U.S. and Iran looked to cool tensions rather than escalate.
The staggering large inventory build in crude, gasoline and distillate stockpiles the EIA reported this week weighed on a market that was already reversing course on geopolitics.
Tomorrow there will be a look at what oil companies are planning amid high U.S. crude production and a build-up in inventories.
Baker Hughes releases its oil rig count at 1 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
The rig count came in at 670 last week and the trend has been down for the past year.
3. Wholesale Inventories Arrive
Also arriving tomorrow are the latest numbers on wholesale inventories.
The Commerce Department will report on the change in value of inventory held by wholesalers for November at 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that inventories were flat for the month, versus an earlier measure of a rise of 0.1%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com."
581,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 04:17PM ET</span>",Stocks: Wall Street Notches Record Highs as Geopolitical Jitters Ease,"Investing.com – Wall Street closed at record highs Thursday, led by a rally in tech on easing geopolitical jitters amid reports that the partial U.S.-China trade deal would be concluded as soon as next week.
The S&P 500 jumped 0.67%, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 0.81% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.74%. All three indexes closed at record highs. 
China's commerce ministry said on Thursday that Vice Premier Liu He is set to sign the phase one trade deal in Washington next week.
With hopes running high that the world's largest two economies may find a resolution to their months-long trade war sooner rather than later, investors piled into mega-cap tech stocks.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) rose more than 1% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) advanded 2% as it continued into record territory.
An uptick in chip stocks also supported tech, underpinned by a rally in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Mizuho upgraded AMD to buy, saying the 2020 server market could be stronger than current consensus, raising the prospect of higher growth for the chipmaker.
Energy, meanwhile, turned from market foe to friend, ending the day higher as oil prices steadied following a rout Wednesday.
Investors have scaled back expectations for a disruption in Middle East oil supplies following President Donald Trump's decision to opt for sanctions on Iran rather than violence in response to the Islamic Republic's attack earlier this week.
In industrials, meanwhile, Boeing (NYSE:BA) pared some of Wednesday's losses, rising 1.50% as reports that Iran had accidentally shot down the Ukrainian International Airlines 737 jet calmed fears the aircraft maker was facing another operational problem within its fleet."
582,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 04:16PM ET</span>",China’s Small-Cap Rally Is Sending a Bullish Signal on Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.
In China’s stock market, a rally in small caps rarely lasts and typically marks the start of excessive risk taking. This time, it’s signaling optimism about the economy.
The outperformance of the ChiNext Index relative to benchmarks of larger companies has already held for six consecutive months, a feat not seen since 2013. It’s continued to start this year.
The advance is partly due to a global risk-on rally sparked by easing trade tensions between China and the U.S. Mainland investors are also hopeful about an economic recovery after some initial signs of stabilization and an easing bias by the central bank. The result has been steady buying of small caps, which are more sensitive to swings in market sentiment given their size.
“It’s an omen, “said Zhu Chaoping, a global market strategist with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. “Investors are pricing in expectations of a mild economic recovery in the first half” of 2020, and “more broad-based gains could be on the way once we see a more favorable economic environment.”
China’s consumer inflation steadied in December after hitting the highest since 2012 the previous month, the latest encouraging economic reading and potentially giving officials room to further ease monetary policy. The People’s Bank of China on New Year’s Day announced a cut to commercial banks’ reserve-requirement ratios, freeing up 800 billion yuan ($115 billion) in funds at a time investors had been expecting support.
Meanwhile, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He plans to sign the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S. next week in Washington.
To be sure, there might be hints of excessive investor optimism. The ChiNext is up 35% from June’s low and on Thursday notched its highest close since October 2017. The 14-day relative-strength reading for both the ChiNext and the onshore yuan has reached overbought territory, a technical benchmark which raises the potential of a near-term pullback.
Small caps are typically a barometer of market sentiment, and extreme rallies in that part of the market previously prompted regulators to take measures to avoid a repeat of 2015’s market crash.
Big start-of-year rallies have occurred for stocks linked to genetically modified crops as well as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., which has started deliveries of locally made vehicles. “Some investors don’t care if the firms will deliver good earnings, so long as they can find the next buyers,” said He Qi, a fund manager with Huatai-PineBridge Fund Management Co. “I don’t think the gains will sustain” for smaller stocks.
Ken Chen, an analyst with KGI Securities Co., disagrees, noting investors have begun moving money out of blue chips and into smaller names. Large caps have been Chinese market outperformers most of the time since 2016.
“Expectations of a recovery in the economy and corporate earnings are starting to become a reality due to an overall monetary-loosening environment and stepped-up efforts to support growth,” said Chen. “Small caps with good growth stories to tell would benefit more.”

583,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 03:34PM ET</span>","Fiat Will Effectively Fund Tesla’s German Factory, Baird Says","(Bloomberg) -- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s deal to pool its fleet with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. to comply with stricter emissions rules in Europe is in effect funding the electric-car maker’s upcoming Germany factory, according to Robert W. Baird & Co.
The Italian-American automaker reached an agreement with Tesla last spring that could cost Fiat Chrysler an estimated 1.8 billion ($2 billion) through 2023. That breaks out to about $150 million to $200 million per quarter and will pad Tesla’s profit margins starting in the first three months of this year, according to Baird analyst Ben Kallo.
“While we acknowledge investors may want to strip out credits in evaluating operational execution, we do note the credits effectively fund Tesla’s European factory,” Kallo wrote in a report Thursday. While he cut his rating on Tesla to the equivalent of a hold, from a buy, the analyst raised his price target to $525, from $355.
Representatives for Fiat Chrysler and Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk announced in November that Tesla planned to build a plant outside Berlin. The facility is expected to produce Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers starting in 2021.
Fiat Chrysler is going to launch a new version of its Fiat 500 battery-powered vehicle in Europe this year, along with plug-in hybrid versions of its Jeep Compass, Renegade and Wrangler models. That, combined with the Tesla credits, should make the company compliant with Europe’s emissions rules, CEO Mike Manley told analysts in July.
While Fiat Chrysler would otherwise struggle to meet new carbon-dioxide emissions standards in Europe, the so-called open-pool option available in the European Union allows automakers to group their fleets together to meet targets. Compliance has gotten harder for automakers as consumers have shifted toward gasoline cars, which emit comparatively more CO2, following Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s diesel-emissions scandal that first erupted in 2015."

Boeing, which has been hurt by the grounding of its single-aisle 737 MAX planes, said last year it expects to lower the production of its 787 Dreamliners in late 2020 to 12 aircraft per month, from 14 currently, following some order cancellations and weak demand.
China, a major buyer of the 787, hasn't been buying airplanes from Boeing recently, and ""it's hard to see the rate of 12 being sustainable"" beyond 2020 without China in the marketplace, Plueger said at a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) conference.
Plueger said Boeing's momentum to develop a new mid-size airplane (NMA) ""has diminished significantly"" due to the prolonged 737 MAX crisis.
The Boeing NMA is a direct competitor to Airbus A321XLR, its longest-range narrow-body jetliner.

""Until (the 737 MAX) is fixed and flying, forget about everything else,"" Plueger said.

586,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 03:04PM ET</span>",Italian court turns down Vivendi's request to suspend freeze on Mediaset stake,"MILAN (Reuters) - An Italian court has thrown out a request by  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) to suspend a ruling forcing it to freeze two-thirds of its stake in Italian broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS), a court document showed on Thursday.
The decision comes a day before a Mediaset shareholder meeting to vote on governance tweaks to a Dutch holding company set up by Mediaset to pursue tie-ups with European peers..
Vivendi opposes Mediaset's plans on the grounds the changes would give Mediaset's main shareholder, the Berlusconi family, too much power.
In 2017 an Italian watchdog said Vivendi's holdings in Mediaset and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) broke competition rules and ordered it to cut one of the stakes to below 10%.
To comply, Vivendi transferred two-thirds of its almost 30% voting rights in Mediaset to a trust, which was subsequently barred from voting at the Italian broadcaster's shareholder meetings.
The administrative court (TAR) ruling showed Vivendi had asked it to suspend the injunction ahead of Friday's meeting on the grounds it expected Mediaset to exclude the trust.
But the judge argued, without giving further details, that there was no reason for any immediate decision since Vivendi was not at risk of irreparable damage.
According to the document, the TAR will convene a closed-door hearing on Jan. 15 to decide on the merits of the case.
In December, the EU Advocate General said the law leading to the freeze was a breach of European Union rules and last week Vivendi filed a request for the ruling to be suspended.
The French group, which owns 23.9% of Telecom Italia, has been at loggerheads with Mediaset since pulling out of a deal to buy its pay-TV unit in 2016 and then building a hostile 28.8% stake.
Mediaset and Vivendi did not comment on the TAR ruling."

588,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 02:22PM ET</span>","Supporting Trump Tariffs, One Exemption at a Time","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Robert Wetherbee, CEO of steelmaker Allegheny Technologies (NYSE:ATI) Inc., has penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal sporting a headline for the ages:
I Support Trump’s Tariffs But Need An Exemption
It’s tough to know if this is merely a straight summation of the piece (which it is) or the pointed effort of some wag on the copy desk. Either way, as pithy distillations of the tricky trade-offs of tariffs go, it is tough to beat.
Allegheny’s management wasn’t always so down on the trade war. Back in the summer of 2017, some months before President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, Wetherbee’s predecessor Richard Harshman told analysts on an earnings call that tariffs held “direct upside potential” for the company.  By early 2018, however, it became clear that semi-finished slabs from Indonesia needed by Allegheny’s A&T stainless-steel joint venture were swept up by the new trade broom. The company filed for an exemption in March of that year, a request that was denied last April.
Wetherbee’s op-ed looks like another attempt, albeit with different paperwork. After acknowledging the wisdom of Trump’s approach in broad terms (read the headline), it then calls tariffs “blunt instruments” that will force the closure of a Pennsylvania plant, risking 300 direct and indirect jobs in a “vital swing state.” (That sound you just heard is the sledgehammer of subtlety being hurled at the Oval Office.) It goes on to say that only three companies in the U.S. produce those slabs, but that doesn’t help because they are direct competitors who have “zero interest” in helping Allegheny prosper (which sounds par for the course, really). The piece closes with a plaintive “Mr. President, we implore you: Save our jobs.”
On the one hand, the U.S. has legitimate trade grievances with China, and commodity industries such as steel are at the bleeding edge of that. Utilization at steel plants has risen since the trade war began, according to a recent report from ClearView Energy Partners.
On the other hand, decades of globalization championed by the very superpower now decrying it have created webs of supply chains that are fiendishly hard to unravel. Case in point: Indonesian semi-finished slabs — who knew? Hence, while everyone in the chosen field supports the blunt instrument in principle, the complex realities beneath demand an edifice of waivers be built, with tariffs generally agreed to work best when they affect one’s competitors only.
Leaving aside Allegheny’s specific woes, the price of protecting steelworkers from foreign competition via tariffs is, as with most any product, higher prices for consumers. In our populist age, that is a price Americans may be willing to vote for again. Besides that gorgeous headline, Wetherbee’s op-ed is a timely reminder that the recent sigh of relief in financial markets about the phase one trade agreement with China looks premature. Given the depth and breadth of the Sino-U.S. rivalry — with geopolitical aspects far beyond mere tariffs and bipartisan antipathy to Beijing — the deal is more partial ceasefire than treaty.
Moreover, it has sprung up in the middle of Trump’s impeachment saga and the final stretch of the 2020 election. It’s very hard to predict how the president will balance a desire to keep stocks humming with an impulse to deliver on years of tough talk about Beijing. Speaking publicly on Thursday morning, he mentioned again the notion that “phase two” might have to wait until after November. For anyone worried, call your representative. Or write an op-ed."
589,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 01:22PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Tesla Skids as Long-Time Bull Moves to Sidelines,"Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell Thursday after a long-time bull suggested it is time to cash in on the electric automaker's recent rally that has seen its shares more than double in just three months.
Baird analyst Ben Kallo, a known Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) bull, downgraded Tesla to neutral from outperform. Shares fell 2%.
""We are moving to the sidelines, admittedly battle-weary after a hard-fought several years, including (approximately) 20% outperformance over the last year... After several years at an Outperform rating, which included contentious arguments with—evidently—high-conviction bears, we recommend profit-taking,"" Kallo said.
The remarkable turnaround in shares of Tesla, which have more than doubled over 90 days, saw the electric carmaker become the highest-valued automaker in U.S. history, boasting a value of $85 billion, topping the $80.8 billion set by Ford in 1999.
But en route to notching the historic milestone, Tesla shares are now fairly valued, leaving little road ahead in the near term, Kallo added.
""While we remain constructive on (the company’s) long-term prospects, we now believe estimates are properly calibrated—particularly on the buy side—and valuation appears more balanced.""
The electric automaker's red-hot run was spurred by a surprise quarterly profit reported in October last year. Since then, reports of progress in China and record deliveries have continued the momentum.
Tesla delivered a record 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of last year, taking the total to 367,500 deliveries, up 50% from 2018.
But some argued that the upswing in demand in the quarter was driven by consumers eager to make a purchase before subsidies for purchasing electric vehicles expire.
Tesla's move into China, however, has the potential to ramp up deliveries,   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) suggested.
""While bears will likely argue 4Q deliveries benefited from strong purchases ahead of tax credits expiring in various countries, Tesla is just about to start deliveries of locally made Model 3s in the very large China market, at an attractive price point."""

Climate Action 100+ was begun in 2017 and includes nonprofit organizations and investors including units of  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA),  Manulife Financial  Corp (TO:MFC) and the California Public Employees' Retirement System.
With some $7 trillion under management BlackRock has an influential voice on how large corporations act on climate matters such as greenhouse gas emissions.

LONDON (Reuters) - A senior former  Barclays  (L:BARC) banker told a London fraud trial on Thursday that he was ordered out of bed after a heart attack to help save the lender at the height of the credit crisis.
Roger Jenkins is on trial with two other former Barclays executives over how the bank secured around 4.0 billion pounds ($5.2 billion) in rescue financing from the Gulf state in 2008.
Jenkins, who was recommended for a 25 million pound bonus for arranging the Qatari investment over June and October 2008, was briefly rattled when prosecutor Edward Brown asked whether he had merely sought to look after his own interests.
""So in answer to your question, Mr Brown, ... I had a heart attack on August 5 (2008) and I was instructed to get out of my bed, leave my family on August 29 and come back to work to help this bank survive,"" 64-year-old Jenkins told the jury at the Old Bailey criminal court.
Barclays avoided the fate of rivals Lloyds (L:LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) and averted a state bailout by raising a total of 11 billion pounds over 2008.
But prosecutors for the UK Serious Fraud Office allege the three men lied to the market and other investors about 322 million pounds in extra fees paid to Qatar, disguised as ""bogus"" advisory services agreements (ASAs).
Jenkins, the former head of Barclays' Middle East business, Tom Kalaris, who ran its wealth division, and Richard Boath, a former head of European financial institutions, deny conspiring to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation, each carrying a maximum 10-year sentence.
Jenkins, once known as the ""gatekeeper to Qatar"" because of his close personal relationship with Qatar's former prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, said the ASAs were approved by lawyers and designed to provide value for Barclays as an investment for genuine services.
""Value is the umbrella that covers services, advice, introduction, deal flow -- it is that which I hang my hat on,"" he told the jury.
Asked why Gay Huey Evans, a former Barclays manager tasked with building relationships with sovereign wealth funds in 2008, did not know about deals for additional services from Qatar, Jenkins said her evidence was ""very surprising"".
But he said he had been too busy to ""tick boxes"" to check how the investment under the ASAs was being monetized during the febrile atmosphere in 2008, when executives stood to lose their bonuses and jobs and banks stood on the brink of collapse.
""I'm sorry I did not tick the boxes and deal with this. It was done later,"" he said."

A spokeswoman for the prosecutor said on Thursday the indictment of Marek Chrzanowski was sent to a court on Dec. 31.
Chrzanowski, who was appointed by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to run the regulator, was charged in 2018 with corruption, leading to a drop in shares of Polish banks and to criticism of PiS.
PiS has long campaigned on a promise to root out corruption in what it describes as self-interested liberal elites.
The indictment was first reported by Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza. There is no requirement in Poland to inform the public when indictments are filed.
Leszek Czarnecki, the owner of mid-sized Polish lender  Getin Noble Bank  (WA:GNB) and Getin Holding (WA:GTN), had accused Chrzanowski of demanding payments of millions of dollars to a lawyer for ""support"", prompting an official investigation.
Chrzanowski has denied the allegations.
A spokesman for the financial regulator and a spokesman for Getin Holding (WA:GTN) declined to comment.
The office of Chrzanowski's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

BEIRUT/TOKYO (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn's lawyer said he was ""very comfortable"" with legal proceedings in Lebanon on Thursday, after the fugitive ex-Nissan boss was questioned over an extradition request from Japan where he faces financial misappropriation charges.
Ghosn fled Japan to Lebanon, his childhood home, last month as he awaited trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.
His dramatic escape has raised tension between Tokyo and Beirut at a time when Lebanon is seeking an international bailout to help it tackle a deep financial crisis.
Ghosn slammed the Japanese justice system at a two-hour news conference on Wednesday, prompting Japan's Justice Minister to launch a rare and forceful public response.
After questioning in Beirut about Japan's Interpol warrant, two judicial sources said the prosecutor had imposed a travel ban, a step Carlos Abou Jaoude, a Beirut-based lawyer for Ghosn, described as procedural to broadcaster Al Jadeed.
Lebanon has no extradition agreement with Japan.
""He (Ghosn) is very comfortable with the path,"" Jaoude told another broadcaster, MTV, adding that Ghosn was also comfortable in himself ""especially after what he went through"".
One of the judicial sources said authorities had asked Japan for its file on Ghosn, including the charges against him, and would not question him again until the information is received. Ghosn would surrender his French passport on Thursday, he said.
Ghosn said later he was more comfortable with the Lebanese judiciary than that of Japan. ""I will fully cooperate,"" he told broadcaster LBCI.
Japan's Justice Minister Masako Mori said Ghosn's allegations that he had had ""zero chance"" of a fair trial in Japan were unfounded.
""Defendant Ghosn was looking to justify his unlawful exit from Japan by propagating a false recognition of our justice system,"" she said at the second of two news conferences, the first of which was held shortly after midnight.
""I felt that we needed to respond immediately to broadcast a correct understanding to people around the world.""
Ghosn told LBCI her comments were ""ridiculous"".
""Today my concern is clearing my name and reputation because all the accusations against me are fabricated,"" he told Al Jadeed. 
TRIAL IN LEBANON?
Ghosn's arrest after his private jet touched down in Tokyo in November 2018 shook the global auto industry and jeopardized the Renault-Nissan alliance of which he was the mastermind.
The Brazilian-born executive said on Wednesday he was prepared to stand trial anywhere he could get a fair hearing but also that he was ready to stay for a long time in Lebanon. 
A source close to the 65-year-old has said his legal team is pushing for him to be tried in the country.
Ghosn said, however, that he did not want to put pressure on Japan-Lebanon bilateral ties, two days after Japan's ambassador to Lebanon requested greater cooperation from President Michel Aoun in dealing with the case.
The decision by Lebanon's prosecutor, Judge Ghassan Ouiedat, after Ghosn's questioning at Beirut's Justice Palace requires Ghosn to keep the authorities informed of his place of residence, the judicial sources said.
Ghosn was given the same instruction after accompanying questioning over a formal legal complaint filed by a group of Lebanese lawyers who accuse him of ""normalisation"" with Israel over a visit he made there in 2008.
Ghosn said on Wednesday he had made the trip as a French citizen and an executive of  Renault  (PA:RENA) to sign a contract with a state-backed Israeli firm to sell electric vehicles, and had been obliged to go because the board had requested it.
He said he had apologized for the trip and had not meant to hurt the people of Lebanon, which deems Israel an enemy state.
During the visit, Ghosn met Ehud Olmert, who was Israel's prime minister at the time of the 2006 war between Israel and the Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah.

Nearly 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, died in the 2006 war and 158 people died in Israel, mostly soldiers.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",Ackman avoids limelight even as Pershing Square posts record 2019,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Two years ago, investor William Ackman, who pushes corporations to perform better, took his own advice and laid out a plan for a comeback after years of losses.
Over dinner at the New York Public Library, Ackman told investors in January 2018 that he was going back to basics by cutting staff, ending investor visits that were eating into his time, and hunkering down in the office to do research.
Now, Ackman has the numbers to prove his strategy is working.
The Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Holdings portfolio, the biggest at his Pershing Square Capital Management firm, returned a stunning 58.1% last year, making it one of the world's best performing hedge funds. It outpaced not only the benchmark S&P 500 stock index's 29% gain, but also the average activist hedge fund's 18.3% return, data from Hedge Fund Research shows.
Ackman has said privately he was going activist on himself to resuscitate his 16-year-old firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, after suffering double-digit losses in 2015 and 2016 followed by smaller declines in 2017 and 2018.
When Ackman next meets investors over dinner in February, he will be able to report that 2019 was his firm's best year ever. Assets stand at $7.4 billion and he will be able to charge performance fees again.
Despite his undisputed bragging rights, investors say they see a more humbled Ackman, who is sticking with the back-to-basics theme. He is staying out of the limelight while methodically searching for his next bets from new offices overlooking the Hudson River.
Ackman declined to comment.
If there was any secret sauce to last year's gains, it included patiently waiting for changes that Ackman had pushed for, often behind the scenes, to pay off, investors said.
Some big winners, including Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG), which returned a whopping 72% over the last year with a new chief executive, have been in the fund for years.
Engagement at Starbucks (O:SBUX), bought in late 2018 and up 40% in the last year, was out of the public eye. Even an investment in Automatic Data Processing (O:ADP), where Ackman lost a bitter proxy contest in 2017, paid off as Ackman and ADP Chief Carlos Rodriguez discussed potential changes over dinner.
Some investors also saw a changed Ackman when he exited his United Technologies (N:UTX) investment after sharply criticizing its planned merger with  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN). The money could be better invested elsewhere, Ackman said, after having privately mused that he previously had held on to soured bets in drug company Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:BHC) and  Herbalife  (N:HLF) for too long.
To be sure, many activists who - like Ackman - had bet portfolio companies would climb, got a boost from a booming stock market. Other firms, like Elliott Management and Third Point, that pursue activist investments plus a range of other strategies, delivered gains in the single- or low double-digits, their investors said.
It may be tough to repeat 2019 but Ackman has noted that Pershing Square has had five years of gains topping 36%."

TheS&P 500 index was trading 13 points higher, or 0.4%, by 9:45 AM ET (14:45 GMT), with the Nasdaq Composite up 67 points, or 0.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 124 points, or 0.4%, at a new all-time high of 28,869.44.
In a statement Wednesday President Donald Trump drew back from new military action after Iran’s missile strikes, instead stating that he would tighten already strong U.S. economic sanctions against the Middle East power. He did not state in which area these new sanctions would hit.
These comments came a few hours after Iran’s foreign minister said the missile strikes “concluded” its response to the killing of military leader Qassem Soleimani.
Investors have thus turned away from this spat and started to focus once more on the fundamentals surrounding the U.S. economy, including an easing Federal Reserve and strong employment growth. 
Further evidence of the healthy employment situation came with the release of the latest weekly  jobless claims data, which fell more than expected last week, down 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended Jan. 4. Economists had forecast claims would fall to 220,000 in the latest week. This follows Wednesday strong ADP data and comes ahead of Friday’s key official employment release.
Bucking the general positive trend are a number of retail stocks which have suffered disappointing sales figures during the important holiday period.
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (NASDAQ:BBBY) dropped almost 18% after stating after hours Wednesday that it would have to change its fiscal 2019 outlook after its earnings miss. 
Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) also fell sharply, down 9.2%, after posting weak numbers in its key women’s business and stating that its 2019 earnings would be at the lower end of its forecast range. 
JC Penney (NYSE:JCP) also fell back after it said its same-store sales over the holiday period dropped 7.5%. Its shares dropped 5%."

Dassault (PA:AVMD) boss Eric Trappier was speaking as head of French aerospace industry body GIFAS, after 17 parliamentarians objected to Latecoere's acquisition by Searchlight Capital, which took a controlling stake last month.
 Latecoere , based in Toulouse, makes aircraft doors and fuselages and is developing phototronic technologies to deliver on-board internet access with light instead of wifi. Its 2018 sales amounted to 658 million euros ($731 million).
""Latecoere is not alone in the market, and it's not strategic to the point where you could say the sky will fall in if (its) ownership wasn't French,"" the Dassault chief executive said in Paris. ""It's a bit overblown.""
Searchlight last year bought a 26% Latecoere stake from funds including Apollo Capital, before increasing the holding to 65.6% in a public offer backed by the French firm and approved under foreign investment vetting procedures.
The 17 members of the parliament's defense and armed forces committee, most from the governing LREM party, had warned in a November letter that the 365 million euro ($406 million) deal raised ""questions about the preservation of know-how and France's defense industry base"", urging government intervention.
Dassault's Trappier said France and Europe should take a more consistent approach to overseas investment that recognizes their industries' need for foreign capital.
""This goes to the heart of our companies' attractiveness to capital,"" he said. ""We do need international funds to invest in our firms - there's no other solution.""

607,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 08:46AM ET</span>","Frankfurt prosecutors file charges against lawyer, former Maple Bank bankers","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The Frankfurt Prosecutor's Office has filed charges against a former partner at global law firm Freshfields and six former bankers of collapsed Maple Bank over their alleged involvement in a fraudulent trading scheme, a source familiar with the matter said.
The Frankfurt Prosecutor’s office said on Thursday the bankers and the tax lawyer are alleged to have caused tax losses for the German state of more than 380 million euros ($422 million) with the planning and executing of so-called ""cum-ex"" deals. The Prosecutor did not name the people charged.
Ulf Johannemann, a former partner at Freshfields, was arrested in November last year as part of an investigation into the tax scam. He has been released on bail.
Johannemann's lawyer Werner Leitner declined to comment. At the time of Johannemann's arrest in November, Leitner said his detention was completely unfounded.
Maple Bank's administrator was not immediately available to comment.
The Frankfurt case is one in a series of investigations across Germany into a scheme which is alleged to have targeted mainly German companies to generate multiple tax reclaims from phantom dividends, known as cum-ex.
Such trades required a syndicate of big banks and investors to work in tandem to engineer the trades.
German federal police in December arrested two former Maple Bank bankers to prevent the men from leaving Germany. They are part of the group of six bankers charged on Thursday.
These arrests were part of the investigation into Maple Bank, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said at the time.
Frankfurt-based Maple Bank collapsed in 2016 due to its involvement in the cum-ex trades.
In a separate case, two British bankers are being tried in Bonn for their alleged roles in a scheme which one told the court involved ""astronomical"" multi-billion-euro trades.
These trades attracted the attention of German tax authorities after around a decade, who slowly stamped them out.
The revelation of the trades has prompted a heated public debate, a parliamentary inquiry and a pledge from Berlin to get back the 5 billion euros it estimates was lost."

Excluding new Saudi loans and bonds of $15.6 billion, energy-company debt in the oil-rich region tumbled by two-thirds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Lending was particularly sluggish in the second half of 2019, when these companies borrowed just $5.5 billion -- the lowest level in three years. Aramco’s majority-owned Satorp refinery venture alone accounted for $3.6 billion of all second-half debt.
Energy companies in the region may need to take on more debt if oil prices keep falling, said Rory Fyfe, chief economist at U.K.-based MENA Advisors. Benchmark Brent crude slid about 10% last year to an average of about $64 a barrel, and growth in oil demand shows signs of faltering. Access to cheap financing could also stimulate borrowing.
“Gulf issuers are very opportunistic, and if we see lower global rates, we could see oil companies coming back to the market,” he said.
Aramco was the driving force for borrowings in 2019. The company’s $12 billion foray into the bond market in April was responsible for more than half of all regional debt sales in the year.
Saudi borrowing is poised to fall in 2020 now that Aramco has completed its initial public offering and expects soon to finish acquiring Saudi Basic Industries Corp. Aramco’s huge bond sale helped finance the Sabic acquisition."

LONDON (Reuters) - World markets looked to have overcome their new year wobbles on Thursday, as the United States and Iran backed away from conflict in the Middle East.
U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that Iran was ""standing down"" after it fired missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq had helped give Asia its best day in weeks and saw Europe's STOXX index reclaim its all-time high record. [.EU] (T) 
Wall Street futures were also pointing upwards (N) as more confident traders edged out of the yen, gold and government bonds where they had taken shelter. [/GOL][GVD/EUR]
Iran fired missiles at military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq on Wednesday in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general. But in an address on Wednesday, Trump said no Americans were hurt and made no direct threats of a military response, although he did say there would be more, albeit unspecified, economic sanctions.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had earlier said the strikes ""concluded"" Tehran's response to the killing of its general, Qassem Soleimani.
""The obvious first conclusion to make is that we see the potential for further yen depreciation going forward,"" said MUFG's EMEA head of research, Derek Halpenny, adding that the likelihood of a major conflict was now low. 
The yen, considered a safe haven during geopolitical turmoil because of its deep liquidity and Japan's current account surplus, continued to reverse its 2020 gains in European trading. It was last down 0.3% at 109.4 to the dollar, its lowest in a week and a half[/FRX].
Another safe currency, the Swiss franc, also fell against both the dollar and the euro..
In Asia, stock markets had taken their cue from Wall Street's overnight bounce. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.3%, its biggest gain in almost a month.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and Shanghai blue chips each added more than 1.2%. Japanese stocks gained 2.3% to their highest for the year. (T)
Australian stocks rose 0.8% to a record closing high. Futures markets pointed to gains continuing in the United States, with S&P 500 futures up 0.3% and Dow futures 0.4% higher.
""I think today is a bit of a relief rally,"" said Shane Oliver, Chief Economist at AMP Capital in Sydney. ""Yesterday, investors were fearing the worst... The news overnight has been more along the lines that Iran pulled its punches and Trump is toning things down.""
ALL IS WELL
Iran's missile attack on U.S. army bases in Iraq on Wednesday had sent gold blasting above $1,600 an ounce and boosted the yen by almost 1% and oil by $3 a barrel.
But it took just hours for that safe-haven dash to fade and for world equities to resume their climb.
Oil is now cheaper than it was before Friday's killing of Iranian commander Soleimani. Brent futures steadied at $65.40 per barrel, about where they began the year.
Gold fell to $1,545 per ounce, giving back Wednesday's gains but remaining more expensive than it was before Soleimani's death, suggesting investors' fears have not evaporated completely. [GOL/] 
U.S. Treasuries, which had soared in the flight to safety, also settled back though. Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note were at 1.8685%, after dropping as low as 1.705%.
Europe's benchmark yields were at one-week highs too, with the benchmark German Bund yield almost 4 basis points higher at -0.22% which was not far off seven-month highs. [GVD/EUR]
Brexit-bound sterling took a dip to $1.3028, its lowest level since Dec. 27, as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said it could provide a ""relatively prompt response"" if the UK economy looked like it was facing prolonged weakness.
The better risk appetite though was also evident in emerging markets. China's trade-exposed yuan reached a five-month high of 6.9281 per dollar and South Africa's rand and Turkey's lira that had both been buffeted this week, saw rebounds. [EMRG/FRX]

Futures for the S&P 500 were trading 11 points, or 0.34%, higher by 07:10 ET (12:10 GMT), futures for the Nasdaq 100 were 44 points, or 0.49%, higher, while the DIJA futures contract was up 101 points, or 0.35%.
In a statement Wednesday President Trump drew back from new military action after Iran’s missile strikes, instead stating that he would tighten already strong U.S. economic sanctions against the Middle East power. He did not state in which area these new sanctions would hit.
These comments came a few hours after Iran’s foreign minister said the missile strikes “concluded” its response to the killing of military leader Qassem Soleimani.
Investors have thus turned away from this spat and started to focus once more on the fundamentals surrounding the U.S. economy, including an easing Federal Reserve and strong employment growth. 
With this in mind, attention with turn to a number of FOMC members due to speak today. Investors will undoubtedly study their words for clues as to what the central bank will do at its next meeting, at the end of this month.
As far as sectors are concerned, tech stocks are likely to remain in demand. Shares in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit an all-time high Wednesday after the tech giant revealed record sales at its App Stores.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares could also be in focus after the electric car maker’s shares jumped 5% yesterday, closing at a record high and pushing its market capitalization to above that of rivals General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) combined."

LONDON (Reuters) - A Christmas crunch inflicted further pain on more British retailers on Thursday, with John Lewis warning its staff they may not get a bonus for the first time since 1953 as consumers changed shopping habits and the economy struggled.
John Lewis flagged lower profits for its 2019 financial year, while  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Britain's biggest retailer, ground out a 0.1% rise in underlying UK sales over Christmas, and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) said waste in its food business and weak menswear and gift sales held it back.
Industry data showed British shoppers cut back on spending in late 2019, rounding off the worst year since at least the mid-1990s for retail sales amid uncertainty over Brexit, last month's election and slowing wage growth.
Instead of buying goods, consumers opted to spend on experiences, data from payment card company Barclaycard showed. Cinema ticket sales were up 19%, while spending in pubs and on takeaway food rose by about 12%, the data showed.
Tesco said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's resounding election victory in December, which broke the deadlock over Britain leaving the European Union and lifted financial market sentiment, had not released any pent-up demand.
Adding to worries that a pick-up may not materialise, Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Britain's second largest supermarket, said on Wednesday it hadn't seen any change in behaviour since the nation went to the polls.
Concerns over the strength of the British economy are being felt more widely and the pound fell to a near two-week low against the U.S. dollar after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that there could be a ""relatively prompt response"" if it looked as though weakness will persist.
For employee-owned John Lewis Partnership, which runs the eponymous department stores business and up-market supermarket Waitrose, the prospect of not paying a bonus for the first time since 1953 highlights how tough times are for some retailers.
Like rival department stores, John Lewis has been under pressure for some time, and in March last year reported a 45% drop in full-year profit, hurt by weak demand and rising costs. 
BRIGHT SPOTS
It is not just the big guns suffering, with pain also being felt among niche players such as British greeting card retailer Card Factory (L:CARDC), which said it expected lower annual earnings, sending its shares down 17%.
Amid the gloom there have been some bright spots, with homeware retailer Dunelm (L:DNLM) forecasting a near 20% jump in earnings for the first half of its fiscal year, thanks to its decision not to discount over the holiday season.
Dunelm's more upbeat outlook echoed British clothing retailer  Next  (L:NXT), which last week raised its full-year profit forecast after a better-than-expected Christmas.
And British pub and restaurant operator Mitchells & Butlers (L:MAB) also saw strong festive season sales, as more diners opted for its pricier healthy menu options.
In an indication of how hard supermarkets had to work over the festive period, Tesco said it had cut prices, delivered its best operational performance in six years and seen its biggest ever day of UK food sales.
Tesco, which has a 27.4% share of Britain's grocery market, had also updated on trading in the third quarter period before Christmas, when life-for-like sales fell by 0.4%.
And although M&S, one of the best known names in British retail, said quarterly underlying sales for its overall UK business rose for the first time since 2017, it was overshadowed by ""one-off issues"", which knocked its shares 7.3% lower.

M&S said its full year forecast was unchanged, although gross margins were expected to be around the lower end of its range, largely offset by cost cuts.

The Alberta-based integrated oil and gas company said it will spend an additional C$1.5 billion on businesses run by the country's indigenous communities.
Opposition from environmental and indigenous groups have stalled new pipeline projects in Canada and the United States that are needed to move Canadian crude to refineries. Investors in the region have also become more vocal about environmental, social and governance issues. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who won a re-election in October last year, promised Canada would achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Trudeau, however, lost his majority in the parliament and failed to win a single seat in Alberta, which produces 80% of Canada's crude.
Ahead of the October 2019 elections, Cenovus, along with  Canadian Natural Resources  Ltd (TO:CNQ) and  MEG Energy Corp  (TO:MEG) took out joint full-page newspaper advertisements to turn up the pressure on politicians to support the struggling industry.
Alberta's oil sands, among Cenovus's main businesses, have been a focal point of global efforts to stifle fossil fuel production by environmental groups. 
Cenovus said on Thursday its long-term ambition is to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The company will reclaim 1,500 decommissioned well sites and complete C$40 million ($30.65 million)of caribou habitat restoration work by 2030.
The company said it is adopting a climate and greenhouse gas emissions strategy with several options to help it reach targets. The strategy will also advance its methane emission reduction initiatives that are already underway at its Deep Basin operations.

DUBAI (Reuters) - First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) (AD:FAB) has started an auction process for a Dubai hotel operated by Shangri-La and owned by indebted construction group Al Jaber with a starting price of 700 million dirhams ($190.59 million), two sources said.
Al Jaber, best known as a contractor but with interests across a range of sectors, has struggled since a construction downturn in the United Arab Emirates after the global financial crisis.
The auction by First Abu Dhabi Bank, which is the main lender for the Shangri-La hotel, marks a first step by creditors to recover funds after delays to a restructuring agreement for 5.9 billion dirhams of debt last year, one of the sources said.
Al Jaber declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Thursday and FAB was not immediately available for comment.
Other creditors will receive distributions from the sale after FAB receives its dues, the sources said.
Creditors – which include hedge funds and Abu Dhabi lender Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (AD:ADCB) – have started an enforcement process against the group's shareholders for a loan Al Jaber's chairman owes to the business, and which creditors have security over, the sources said.
ADCB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.One of the sources said the enforcement is expected to formally begin shortly, after two thirds of all the lenders voted for it.
Al Jaber began talks with creditors in 2011 after building up debt to expand beyond construction work.
As part of the restructuring agreement, Al Jaber was expected to appoint a new board, sell operating companies, some of its investment portfolio and assets such as the Shangri-La hotels in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
In exchange for this, creditors had agreed to extend the maturity of Al Jaber’s 5.9 billion dirhams loan, cut interest rates, and provide additional revolving debt.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust regulator is looking into allegations that Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI), the country's biggest car maker, pushes buyers to purchase insurance policies offered by the company, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in June last year received an anonymous complaint alleging insurance plans recommended by Maruti while selling cars resulted in customers paying more compared with other options in the market.
Based on the complaint, the CCI is assessing whether Maruti has engaged in so-called ""tie-in arrangements"", in which a car maker promotes preferred suppliers of complementary goods such as lubricants or insurance, the sources said.
Indian law says such practices are anti-competitive if they end up stifling competition and limiting consumer choices.
The Commission is looking into the complaint and ""it will take a while"", said one of the two sources, who declined to be named as the case details are private.
In response to Reuters questions, a Maruti spokesman said: ""We are not aware of any such alleged complaint that is being investigated by CCI and therefore cannot comment on the same.""
The CCI did not respond to a request for comment.
The watchdog can still throw the complaint out if it finds no merit in the allegation, or order a deeper probe by its investigations arm.
Maruti is already the subject of another antitrust investigation in India. Last year, the CCI ordered its investigations unit to probe allegations the carmaker limits discounts its dealers can offer, a prohibited anti-competitive practice if it hurts consumers. [nL4N2452JM]
If the CCI decides to launch a wider probe into the new complaint, it could ask its investigation unit to wrap it into the ongoing case into Maruti's discounting practices, or order a fresh investigation, the second source said.
It was not clear over what period the anonymous complaint about insurance sales relates to.
Maruti, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor (T:7269), is a market leader in India with a 50% share of the passenger vehicles market. It sold 1.73 million cars in the fiscal year ending March 2019 and has around 3,600 sales outlets.
The allegation of insurance tie-up arrangements against Maruti is similar to an earlier complaint against its competitor, South Korean carmaker  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), a third source aware of the complaint told Reuters.
In 2014, following a complaint from a car dealer, the CCI found initial merit in the allegations that Hyundai had entered into several tie-in arrangements, including to promote certain insurance companies, and ordered a wider investigation.
However, in its final order in 2017, the CCI said Hyundai's insurance arrangements were not anti-competitive.
""The most credible way for Maruti to show there is no tie-in would be by providing actual data on Maruti car buyers opting for insurers other than those recommended by it,"" said Rahul Rai, a New Delhi-based lawyer specializing in antitrust law."

Autostrade, part of infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL), has been struggling to overcome a standoff over the license following the collapse of the Morandi bridge in Genoa in August 2018, which killed 43 people.
Asked whether Autostrade's offer to cut tollway fees by 700 million euros ($778 million) as part of a settlement would be enough, De Micheli replied: ""The proposal is insufficient"".
""We would have expected a significant reduction in tariffs at the tollgate without modifying a plan for greater investment in the network and in maintenance,"" she said.
De Micheli has been under pressure from the 5-Star Movement, partners in Italy's ruling coalition government, to revoke Autostrade's license. But her center-left Democratic Party has resisted the call, arguing instead for renegotiating terms of the concession.
Her comments in La Repubblica appear to indicate a hardening in the PD position that could open the way to the concession being canceled. Autostrade has said this could force it into bankruptcy putting thousands of jobs at risk.
""The adoption of a revocation rests on two points, judicial and economic. Both have to be considered,"" De Micheli said.
The PD and the centrist Italia Viva party, the third partner in the coalition, worry that cancelling the concession would cost billions in compensation to Autostrade, potentially embroiling the state in a long legal battle and hurting Italy's image with international investors.
Underlining the tensions within the government, 5-Star officials repeated on Thursday that fining Autostrade would not be enough and that the motorway concession would have to be canceled and road tolls cut.
According to government sources, Autostrade has offered a total of 2 billion euros to resolve the standoff but the offer is considered insufficient by both 5-Star and the PD.
""The famous 2 billion proposed by Autostrade in compensation would actually only be 700 million because there would be 500 million to rebuild the bridge and another 800 million for the Genoa region and the government is taking these items as a given,"" a PD official said.
""The 700 million is not enough, everyone in the coalition is agreed on this,"" the person said.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Local government shell companies in China bought into struggling privately run listed firms for the first time last year, veering from their typical remit of financing infrastructure projects to pump over $2 billion into cash-strapped businesses.
Local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) acquired controlling or near-dominant stakes in 11 China-listed firms, showed Reuters calculations based on stock exchange filings. They also bought into a handful of small, capital-starved banks.
The stimulus comes amid central government calls to aid struggling private-run businesses at a time when economic growth has slowed to its weakest pace in almost 30 years.
At the same time, the government has moved to curb LGFV activity to stem financial risk, calling on them to operate independently and banning local authorities from offering them implicit guarantees.
Buying into struggling firms, however, raises concern about the weight of LGFVs' own debt pile which S&P Global Ratings said was as much as $6 trillion in October 2019 - a year in which they sold a record $430 billion worth of bonds.
Of last year's 11 deals, the biggest was the $500 million Jinan Urban Construction Group Co Ltd paid for 26% of textile conglomerate Shandong Ruyi, which has racked up substantial debt after an international luxury brand buying spree.
In another deal, Harbin Economic Development & Investment Co and another government-backed asset manager bought a 48% controlling stake in  Harbin Bank  Co Ltd (HK:6138), loosening the lender's ties with embattled conglomerate Tomorrow Holdings Co Ltd.
LGFVs flourished in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis as local authorities used them to finance infrastructure projects while skirting central government budget limits.
Today, some weaker LGFVs are themselves flirting with default and not all will get a local government bailout, Ivan Chung, head of Greater China Credit Research at Moody's said.
""If a company has a relatively big debt problem or operational issue, rescuing it today could lead to bigger woes tomorrow.""
In one sign of stress, an LGFV in Inner Mongolia narrowly missed a bond default in December, prompting calls from central bank advisors to draw up rescue plans for LGFVs themselves.
To minimize systemic risk, the central government should gradually let weak businesses fail - including LGFVs - rather than rescue them indiscriminately, said economist Chi Lo at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management.
""I believe eventually it will allow more and bigger LGFVs to exit the system,"" he said."

“Willie has been the main driver of this unique idea that is IAG,” Antonio Vazquez, the group’s chairman, said in a statement, adding that Gallego is the right person to take over, having led “a profound transformation” of the once under-performing Iberia.
Gallego’s successor at Iberia will be announced in due course, IAG said."

Three of the biggest retailers in the U.K. struggled with brutal price pressure and the shift to e-commerce over Christmas.
Marks and Spencer Group Plc (LON:MKS) said it expects gross margins around the lower end of its guidance for the year after holiday sales at its long-struggling clothing and home unit were weaker than the consensus.
  Tesco   Plc's (LON:TSCO) revenue dropped on a comparable basis as a weaker performance in central Europe masked growth in the U.K. that came ahead of expectations. Food also performed better at Marks & Spencer.
Adding to the downbeat tone, John Lewis Partnership Plc warned that it might not pay a bonus to its employee-owners after a drop in revenue. Paula Nickolds, the managing director of its department store division, is leaving.
The reports confirm fears that U.K. retailers would suffer over Christmas in an increasingly tough U.K. retail environment, marked by intense promotional pressure and weighed down by political turmoil.
Marks & Spencer shares fell as much as 4.8% in London. The stock has lost more than half its value after dropping in each of the past five years.
M&S’s outperformance in food stems from investments in the product range and price cuts. Menswear and lower gift sales held back the clothing unit. The company has been trying to turn around its business for the past decade, and its latest efforts are being led by Chairman Archie Norman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Rowe.
Rowe said the weakness in Christmas sales were largely due to one-time issues such as the menswear performance and waste in the food unit.
M&S Changes
“The changes we made earlier in the year in clothing have arrested the worst of the issues of the first six months and we are progressively building a much stronger team for the future,” he said in a statement.
The reports follow updates from grocers Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc (LON:MRW) and J   Sainsbury   (OTC:JSAIY) Plc earlier this week. While Morrison acknowledged that its lackluster sales were partly its own fault -- it failed to take part in Black Friday sales this year -- Sainsbury's (LON:SBRY) performance was fairly robust.   Next   Plc (LON:NXT), the first retailer to update the market last week, also beat market expectations.
The departure of Nickolds at John Lewis follows that retailer’s decision announced in June to name U.K. former telecom regulator Sharon White as its next chairman. The company’s department-store operations have been hit especially hard by the growth of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and other online retailers.
 Tesco  (LON:TSCO) rose as much as 0.8% in London. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein called the chain’s U.K. results a “material outperformance” compared to rivals.
“In a subdued U.K. market, we performed well, delivering our fifth consecutive Christmas of growth,” said Tesco CEO Dave Lewis, who will be leaving the grocer this year.

Swaak will take over from Van Dijkhuizen at the company's annual meeting April 22, pending regulatory and shareholder approval, the bank said in a statement.
His appointment comes as the bank is under investigation by Dutch prosecutors who allege the group failed to detect, report and prevent suspicious transactions.
Chairman Tom de Swaan said Swaak was a seasoned veteran who would give a high priority to ""improvement programs relating to Detecting Financial Crime (DFC), promoting public-private cooperation on DFC and compliance with the growing number of rules and regulations.""
Swaak, 59, said in a statement he was looking forward to the job including the challenges it would entail.
Van Dijkhuizen has been ABN's CEO since 2017, and was CFO when the bank returned to the stock market in 2015 after it was nationalized during the 2008 financial crisis.
The Dutch state continues to hold a 56% stake in ABN, which does the majority of its business in the Netherlands.
The bank's shares have fallen 23% over the past year, despite a strong Dutch economy, due to falling European interest rates and worries over the size of any potential fines resulting from the money laundering investigation.

BUDAPEST/WARSAW (Reuters) - Eastern Europe is a new frontier for private medical care, and insurers and tech startups are racing to steal a march on their rivals by harnessing the region's health data.
Growing numbers of people in Eastern European states, from Hungary and Poland to Romania, are turning to private health. The shift is being driven by rising wages, coupled with low public health spending which has often led to staff shortages and long waiting times for tests and surgery.
Now big insurance players in the region, including PZU, Generali (MI:GASI), Vienna Insurance Group (VIG) and Allianz (DE:ALVG), are looking to gather and analyze patient data from the fast-growing market to improve risk assessments and pricing.
""Data is the foundation of the future,"" said Gabriella Almassy, general manager of VIG's Hungarian division, adding that data would be key to identifying where profits can me made in the region's increasingly competitive health insurance market.
To that end, many insurers are teaming up with technology companies such as Polish startup Infermedica, whose software analyzes anonymized health information to provide preliminary diagnoses.
""We are seeing a health data boom that resembles the financial data boom from 10-15 years ago when the banking sector changed a lot,"" said Maciej Malenda, head of partnerships at Infermedica, which works with PZU and Allianz.
""Calling it a gold rush is perfectly accurate.""
PZU, the region's biggest insurer, said it was also looking into dozens of other startups to help it expand its health business.
Health data is an increasingly coveted prize for insurers and technology companies globally.
The trend was illustrated by Google's plans to buy fitness-tracker maker Fitbit for $2.1 billion, announced late last year. The deal will bring the web giant a rich trove of data gathered by millions of Fitbit devices, which monitor users' daily steps, calories burned, heart rate and sleep quality, among other things.
Fitbit has already partnered with insurers, and analysts say much of its value may now lie in its health data.
RISKY BUSINESS: DOLPHIN VS WHALE
The fledgling nature of the Eastern European private healthcare market presents rare opportunities, due to low market saturation compared with more mature Western markets, combined with rising consumer spending power - however it also poses the biggest obstacles for insurers.
Executives say a scarcity of data can make it difficult, or unwise, to identify trends and complicates the pricing of risk. They stress that it could take several years before investments in data collection and analysis pay off, although they declined to disclose spending figures, citing commercial sensitivity.
Attila Hevesi, a product development manager at Generali's Hungarian division, said there was no comparison between the quantity and quality of data available for health insurance and, for example, car insurance.
""The two are not on the same page,"" he said. ""It is like a dolphin versus a blue whale. But maybe even a dolphin is an exaggeration.""
In an illustration of the thinking of big insurers, Hevesi said Generali had struck a big health insurance deal with a large employer which could end up being loss-making, but it was willing to take the risk to build up its trove of patient data in the emerging Hungarian market.
He declined to give details about that deal, but said Generali was incrementally improving its pricing in Hungary as a result of data-gathering.
VIG's Czech division also said access to reliable health data was a problem.
""Today, we are pricing based on clients' data used for life insurance,"" said Kooperativa board member Filip Kral.
DATA PROTECTION PERILS
Another major challenge facing the nascent regional market is ensuring data privacy and security.
Companies handling personal data are required to protect confidentiality and need to put appropriate security measures in place to comply with stringent EU data protection rules.
However the risks of handling sensitive health information were illustrated in October when Hungary's National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition was hacked, with the data of thousands of patients leaked from pharmacies and drug wholesalers.
Elsewhere in Europe, a British hospital trust was rapped by privacy authorities two years ago for misusing data, after it passed on personal information of around 1.6 million patients to AI firm Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DeepMind.
Despite the potential pitfalls, however, many insurers looking to carve out a niche in Central and Eastern Europe's health market have little choice but to embrace data-gathering to improve pricing and profitability.
VIG, for example, is planning to steer many Hungarian customers to a self-service online platform this year, which would give the company more granular data on how patients use private health services.
In the first nine months of 2019, VIG's health insurance premium volumes rose to 513 million euros, with 62% of that coming from Austria and the rest from Central and Eastern Europe - but the group is banking on the latter to underpin its business in coming years, according to spokesman Wolfgang Haas.

Fifty-two restaurants in southwestern Ontario will now serve the “P.L.T.” sandwiches -- plant, lettuce and tomato that feature Beyond Meat’s pea-based patties -- for 12 weeks starting Jan. 14.
“As we expand the test, we’re continuing to listen to our guests across Southwestern Ontario and assess the appetite for a plant-based alternative within the McDonald’s menu,” Michaela Charette, head of Consumer Insights at McDonald’s Canada, said in a statement.
The test will include 27 new locations; while three restaurants in Sarnia in the original trial will be removing the P.L.T. from their menus, McDonald’s told Bloomberg in an email.
Beyond shares jumped as much as 3.1% in New York Wednesday, following a 12% surge yesterday. They tripled last year.
Alexia Howard, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, cautioned against too much excitement. “The initial feedback has been largely positive, although it seems that the trial has not been a blowout success thus far that justifies an immediate nationwide rollout across both Canada and the U.S.”
The companies announced in September that the world’s largest restaurant chain would sell the sandwiches in 28 stores in Ontario in a test run.
“We’re pleased that McDonald’s customers have shared they are enjoying the delicious, plant-based burger,“ said a Beyond Meat spokesperson.
McDonald’s also sells an imitation meat burger in Germany with a product from Nestle SA (SIX:NESN).
The Canadian expansion “doesn’t tell me anything about the U.S.,” said Michael Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Noting the scale needed to supply 14,000 McDonald’s restaurants, he said that Nestle is a more likely supplier.
Beyond Meat has rapidly spread across the restaurant industry in recent years and now has products in 9,000 Dunkin’ stores across the country, as well as at chains like Del Taco, Carl’s Jr., and Denny’s. McDonald’s scale -- with roughly 14,000 locations in the U.S. alone -- represents a unique challenge and opportunity for the company.
Competitor Impossible Foods Inc. has already rolled out a hamburger at U.S. Burger Kings and this week announced that an Impossible Croissan’wich, a sandwich with the new Impossible Sausage, would launch in five test markets at the end of the month.
Impossible Foods, which makes a soy-based patty, had experienced shortages at times as it ramped up production to meet widespread demand, but announced a deal in July with global food producer OSI Group to expand production.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's FAW Group [SASACJ.UL] aims to double its annual sales of Chairman Mao Zedong's carmaker of choice, Hongqi, or Red Flag, to 200,000 units this year and grow them further to 1 million cars in the next decade, its chairman Xu Liuping said.
Hongqi, launched in 1958 by the state-owned carmaker, will have 21 car models under its marque and 18 of them will be electrified by 2025, Xu said at an event held in China's Great Hall of People late on Wednesday.
Hongqi, based in the northeastern city of Changchun, has undergone several revamps over the decades, falling out of favor for a period in the 1980s.
But it has seen a recent revival amid a national push to promote Chinese brands and has been President Xi Jinping's ride of choice during recent military parades.
Regarded as a cultural symbol of China's ruling Communist Party, Hongqi in 2018 hired former Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) designer Giles Taylor, whose works include Rolls-Royce's Phantom VIII limousine and the brand's first sport-utility vehicle model Cullinan, to head its design team in Munich.
Xu said China's car market, the world's largest, was also becoming its most competitive, with Hongqi emerging as a benchmark for China's premium local brands.
Hongqi expanded its dealership system to around 271 sites in China and sold 100,166 cars last year. It plans to sell 200,000 units this year, 400,000 units in 2022 and 600,000 units in 2025, Xu said. Hongqi also plans to develop its own ride-sharing service.
In 2030, FAW, which has partnerships with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota (T:7203), overall aims to sell around 800,000 to a million units, the 55-year-old Xu said.
Hongqi's ambitious sales targets, however, come as China's car market is set to fall for a second year in a row. The market is expected to contract by around 8% in 2019 and drop again this year."

Overnight, U.S. President Donald Trump said Iran has appeared to be “standing down.”

""The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it,"" the president added.
His comments eased concerns of further escalation of conflict in the Middle East. 
However, the president added that the U.S. will “immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime.”
His comments came after Iran reportedly launched rockets against U.S. military bases in Iraq. Last week, Iran’s top general Qasem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad.
Global equities slumped on Wednesday after the attack, but recovered after the two countries appeared to suggest a halt in hostilities. "

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Wednesday informed its California customers that it would switch to providing estimates as opposed to fixed prices for its rides in response to a new law that makes it harder to qualify its drivers as contractors.
In an email sent out to riders and seen by Reuters the company said the final price would now be calculated at the end of a trip, ""based on the actual time and distance traveled.""
""Due to a new state law, we are making some changes to help ensure that Uber remains a dependable source of flexible work for California drivers,"" the company said in the email.
The change applies to all private rides, while upfront prices will continue to be provided for shared, or pooled rides.
The email included a picture displaying an example of a ride request on the Uber app. It showed a $27 to $36 range for an UberX ride, the company's most popular private ride option. 
Uber in a blog post on Wednesday said the step was the result of changes to its fare structure, with drivers still getting paid per mile and minute, but the company now taking a fixed 25% cut from drivers. That service fee previously fluctuated.
Uber on Wednesday also told customers it discontinued some of its reward benefits for frequent riders.
The company hopes the changes will bolster its argument that Uber is merely a technology platform connecting riders with drivers, not a transportation company.
The California law strikes at the heart of the ""gig economy"" business model by making it harder for companies to qualify their workers as contractors rather than employees. The measure went into effect on Jan 1.
By classifying contractors as employees, technology companies like Uber,  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), DoorDash and Postmates Inc would be subject to labor laws that require higher pay and other benefits, such as medical insurance.
Uber and Postmates, a courier services provider, in a lawsuit in late December asked a U.S. court to block the law.
Uber has repeatedly said that its drivers are properly classified as contractors. 

Nevertheless, the company has made changes to its driver app in recent weeks, with California drivers now being able to see more information ahead of accepting a trip, including the ride's likely fare, length and destination.

(Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Wednesday it was launching an investigation into the Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana.
The crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA's special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects the company's so-called Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.
It is the third Tesla crash NHTSA has said it was investigating in recent weeks. Autopilot had been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles that were involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016. Tesla did not immediately comment.
NHTSA is also probing another Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Model S Tesla in Gardena, California. In that incident, the vehicle exited the 91 Freeway, ran a red light and struck a 2006 Honda Civic, killing its two occupants.
Also in December, NHTSA had said it was investigating a crash in which a Tesla Model 3 rear-ended a parked police car in Connecticut.
The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system’s ability to detect hazards, especially stationary objects. There are mounting safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has criticized Autopilot's lack of safeguards and said in September in its probe of a 2018 Culver City, California, Tesla crash that the system’s design ""permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task.""
Tesla and NHTSA both advise drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot. Tesla says Autopilot ""enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane,"" but does not make the vehicle autonomous.
Some drivers say they are able to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods when using the system. In November, U.S. Senator Ed Markey said Tesla should disable Autopilot until it installs new safeguards to prevent drivers from evading system limits that could let them fall asleep.
NHTSA said its special crash investigation team has reviewed a total of 23 crashes involving vehicles where it was believed some form of advanced driver assistance system played a role."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - For the first time, Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) stock market value has eclipsed the combined values of General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
The Silicon Valley electric car maker's stock jumped nearly 5% on Wednesday, closing at a record $492.14 per share and elevating its market capitalization to almost $89 billion, or $2 billion larger than the sum of General Motors' and Ford's respective market caps of $50 billion and $37 billion.

(GRAPHIC: U.S. automakers' market cap history - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/730/730/Historical%20Market%20Caps.jpg)
Fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter, Tesla's stock has more than doubled in the past three months.
“It’s clear that Tesla is back to being a story stock and there’s a lot of good news out there,” said David Kudla, chief investment strategist at MainStay Capital Management. “But there are still some problematic issues out there, chief among them is what will its sustained profitability look like, and when will it start to be valued like a car company and not a tech company.”
The progress made by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has defied short sellers and other traders expecting the automaker to be overtaken by long-established car companies, including GM and Ford.
Underscoring investors' confidence in Musk and his company's future growth, its market capitalization has outpaced its U.S. rivals, even as their businesses dwarf Tesla's. GM and Ford each delivered more than 2 million vehicles in the United States last year, compared with Tesla's worldwide deliveries of 367,500 vehicles.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. automakers' expected sales - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/729/729/Expected%20Sales.jpg)
While Tesla's recent progress has cheered supporters, many analysts and investors remain pessimistic about the company's ability to consistently deliver profit and cash flow.
The company has repeatedly missed targets in recent years and Musk's mercurial behavior has come under close scrutiny from financial regulators and shareholders of Tesla.
However, most mainstream automakers are still ramping up new generations of electric vehicles designed to compete with Tesla's combination of style, technology and performance.
German automakers Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG all have promised to launch fully electric premium models. GM’s Cadillac luxury brand is gearing up to launch a series of electric SUVs and cars, while Ford’s Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, unveiled in November, will launch later this year and could compete with Tesla’s Model X or soon-to-launch Model Y SUVs. Ford, GM and other manufacturers have electric pickups in the works to take on Musk’s futuristic Cybertruck.
Rival electric vehicle models from Audi, Jaguar and Porsche have fallen short of Tesla’s driving range between charges and failed to match Tesla’s brand cachet.
More analysts rate Tesla ""sell"" than ""buy,"" which is extremely unusual for companies on Wall Street. Eleven analysts recommend buying Tesla shares, while 13 recommend selling and another nine are neutral, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of GM are about unchanged over the past 12 months, while Ford has risen 10%, both drastically underperforming the broader market, with a slump in China car sales hurting investor sentiment in both of those companies."
636,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 06:01PM ET</span>","Walmart opened 134 stores in Mexico in 2019, biggest expansion in six years","By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) last year launched its biggest expansion in Mexico since 2013, opening 134 new stores in its top foreign market and boosting its presence by nearly 5%, the retailer said Wednesday.
Walmart now runs 3,407 stores in Mexico, where it has more locations than in any other country outside the United States, its Mexican unit, Walmart de Mexico (MX:WALMEX), said in a monthly report.
Nearly all the new units belong to the Bodega Aurrera family of stores, including the small, no-frills Bodega Express that is cheaper and quicker to build than Walmart's bigger formats.
The emphasis on the Bodega chain, which offers cheaper goods in line with Walmart's ""Everyday Low Prices"" strategy, is also part of the retailer's push to compete with informal marketplaces and win over low-income shoppers.
""This is where you find the great population mass that Walmart is going after,"" said Valentin Mendoza, an equity analyst at Banorte.
Although analysts expect Walmart to maintain its pace of growth as it seeks to generate a higher percentage of sales from new stores, Mendoza noted expansion can create headaches for a company that is already Mexico's biggest retailer.
""Where is the ideal point where you can keep growing without cannibalizing the sales you already have?"" he said.
Walmart hit a recent record for new stores in 2011, when it opened 365 locations in Mexico.
The following year, the firm became embroiled in allegations it paid bribes to fuel its real estate expansion, and the pace of new openings slowed dramatically in the aftermath.
Last year's new openings were the highest since 2013, when Walmart opened 214 stores across Mexico.
In Central America, where the weak regional economy has dampened business, Walmart opened 27 stores in 2019.
Sales at Walmart stores open for more than a year in Mexico rose 2.6% in December compared with the same month in 2018, while total sales in the country rose 4.1%."

638,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 05:11PM ET</span>",New UK industry code aims to prevent Carillion-style crashes,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Internal auditors should have direct access to top company bosses to help avoid Carillion-style corporate crashes, a new industry code said on Wednesday.
The code from the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (CIIA) aims to restore credibility in internal auditors' ability to be the ""eyes and ears"" of boards to stamp out poor governance and misconduct.
Companies hire internal auditors to check for compliance with regulations. They are different from external auditors or outside accounting firms that independently endorse company financial statements.
The code, which CIIA members voluntarily sign up to, says internal auditors should have unrestricted access to any part of a company and be able to attend and observe executive committee meetings.
They should also have a direct line to the company's chief executive and to the company's external audit committee.
Internal auditors should share information with external auditors, the code said, implementing a recommendation from a government-backed review of auditing in December.
Every company should have a chief internal auditor, even when internal auditing is outsourced as in the case of Carillion, the code said.
The CIIA hopes the new code will make it harder for company management to stonewall internal auditors' concerns.
Andrew Bailey, head of Britain's Financial Conduct Authority and governor-designate of the Bank of England, said in 2012 that boards of banks had regarded internal auditors as a ""nuisance"" not be taken seriously.
This led to the creation of a code for internal auditors specifically for financial services companies, which has resulted in an increase in chief audit executives' attendance of executive committee meetings to 84% from 48%, the CIIA said. The CIIA's members are drawn from most of Britain's biggest listed companies.
The number of financial firms carrying out audit work on risks from poor culture has risen from 54% to 93%.
The CIIA hopes the changes resulting from the financial services code can be replicated by the new, separate code for companies in other sectors.
The new code was written by a committee of officials from companies like oil group  BP  (L:BP), energy firm  Centrica  (L:CNA), supermarket  Tesco  (L:TSCO), and InterContinental Hotels Group (L:IHG), along with the Financial Reporting Council, which regulates accounting."

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday signaled strong support for self-driving vehicles as it released new guidance from federal agencies at the annual CES tech conference.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao unveiled the administration's latest principles for autonomous vehicles -- dubbed 4.0, which she says unifies autonomous efforts across 38 U.S. departments and agencies. The proposal was first reported earlier Wednesday by Reuters.
""The takeaway from AV 4.0 is that the federal government is all in -- for safer, better and more inclusive transportation, aided by automated driving systems,"" Chao said.
The administration did not endorse new regulatory rules to ensure that automated vehicles are safe. Chao told Reuters in a recent interview that in contrast the Obama administration's approach was ""very prescriptive... and in many ways it hampered innovation.""
White House technology adviser Michael Kratsios said the principles will ""help foster an environment for innovators to advance safe AV technologies.""
The 51-page 4.0 policy document released Wednesday says the U.S. government will adopt and promote ""flexible, technology-neutral policies that will allow the public, not the federal government or foreign governments, to choose the most economically efficient and effective transportation and mobility solutions.""
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the March 2018 death of a pedestrian in a crash with an Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc test vehicle, the first-ever attributed to a self-driving car. The NTSB faulted the distracted back-up who failed to intervene when the vehicle did not properly identify the pedestrian and Uber's safety culture.
The NTSB said in November U.S. regulators should make those assessments mandatory and ensure automated vehicles have appropriate safeguards. Chao said she is still reviewing the NTSB recommendations.
Advocates for Highway Safety said the administration's ""voluntary guidelines are completely unenforceable, will not result in adequate performance standards and fall well-short of the safeguards that are necessary to protect the public."" 
Chao said Wednesday ""automated vehicles have the potential to save thousands of lives annually.""
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is reviewing how it can remove regulatory barriers to self-driving cars and considering whether to let General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) deploy some vehicles without steering wheels. Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle.

""I want the federal government to support innovation but not at the risk of safety,"" Chao told Reuters.

641,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 04:57PM ET</span>",Red Flags Emerge With Record-High Stocks Brushing Aside Political Turmoil,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump toned down rhetoric against Iran, fueling a rally in American stocks that took major benchmarks to fresh records.
The rebound from an overnight rout that topped 1.5% has some investors breathing a sigh of relief, but another cohort point to mounting signs that the comeback is a sign of complacency among bulls.
“This is a market looking through fundamental data, looking through corporate guidance and data points, looking through Fed guidance itself,” Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management, told Bloomberg Television. “It is a market that wants to go up in the short term. That is what makes it so profoundly dangerous.”
Below are five charts that urge caution:
Who Needs Hedging?
As the world awaited Iran’s response to Friday’s U.S. killing of a top general, equity traders showed little inclination to hedge against losses. The cost of a bearish put option versus that of a call continued to slide, recently touching levels that have been rare throughout the bull market, Cboe data show.
Breadth Surge
The latest surge has taken 82% of S&P 500 firms above their average price for the past 200 days, the highest percentage in two years. Such strong market breadth, where gains are not concentrated in a few heavyweights, is generally a sign that a rally has room to run. But Frank Cappelleri, a senior equity trader and market technician at Instinet in New York, says the current reading is a “frothy indicator we need to watch.”
According to Cappelleri, the last time so many firms topped the key level, the benchmark fell into a correction not long after. “Eventually, many stocks will slip back below their long-term moving averages -- like they always do,” Cappelleri wrote to clients Wednesday.
Shorts Evaporate
After last year’s historic run, investors continue to expect further gains. Short sales in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, known by its ticker SPY (NYSE:SPY), as a percentage of shares outstanding fell to 1.1% Tuesday, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. That’s the lowest level since January 2018, before the event known as “Volmageddon” sent stocks swooning.
Leveraged Love
Exchange-traded fund investors are going all in, rushing for some of the riskiest products out there that bet stocks will keep on rising. Jason Goepfert, the president of Sundial Capital Research, tracks assets in popular leveraged long products (ProShares Ultra S&P 500 ETF and ProShares Ultra QQQ, for example) compared to their counterparts that bet on a decline. Over the past month, assets in leveraged long ETFs have gained more than 15%, while the short products have lost more than 10%, his data show.
“This is another concern for stocks here, as leveraged traders have become far too comfortable,” Goepfert wrote to clients.
Technical Signs
One particular technical indicator is now flashing “sell.” The GTI Vera Convergence Divergence Indicator, which measures momentum shifts upwards and downwards, received a new bearish signal late last week, and warning continues to flash."
642,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>",JPMorgan Chase raises fee on popular Sapphire Reserve credit card,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said on Wednesday it was raising the annual fee for its popular Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card by $100, according to a press release from the bank. Starting on Jan. 12, all new applicants for the card will be charged a $550 annual fee, up from $450. After April 1, all existing cardholders will be charged the higher annual fee when it comes time for their annual renewal.
The largest U.S. bank said in the statement that the price increase comes as it expands its program of travel rewards and ways to earn points. 
The bank has also struggled to manage the expense of the Sapphire Reserve card, which annually gives customers hundreds of dollars in travel credit and rewards points for a range of transportation expenses, like airline flights, roadway tolls and subway fares.
More than 40 million U.S. households have a credit card from JPMorgan, which comprises about 19 percent of the market, executives have said. 
The bank is gambling that customers will deem the Chase Sapphire Reserve cards, which launched in 2016, valuable enough for its rich rewards and travel perks that they do not mind the $100 price increase. 
This week, the bank announced new partnerships with the ride-hailing app  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) and the food delivery services DoorDash Inc. 
Starting Jan. 13, Sapphire Reserve cardholders will get 10 points per dollar spent on Lyft rides and a free year subscription to Lyft's membership program, Lyft Pink, which gives users discounted rides and other perks. (https://reut.rs/35DA3fs)

Shares climbed 0.6% in after-hours trading.
The wholesale club said sales rose 10.5% to $17.04 billion in the five weeks ended January 5, with same-store sales up 9%.
For the 18 weeks ended January 5, the company reported sales of $56.99 billion, an increase of 7.5% from $52.99 billion seen a year earlier.
The climb in sales was driven by Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions occurring a week later this year versus last year, Costco said.

(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) on Wednesday said it has teamed up with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to offer extended rewards to Chase customers using their credit cards to pay for Lyft rides.
The ride-hailing company said the partnership was aimed at attracting and retaining high-value riders who travel often and use its services frequently.
The announcement comes after Lyft's management in October said it planned to expand its partnership with corporations to incentivize business travelers who outspend other riders.
Lyft and its larger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc have struggled to convince investors they can turn a profit, with Lyft's share price falling more than 30% since going public in March.
Under the new offer, launching on Jan 13, members of Chase's Sapphire Reserve credit card will earn 10 rewards point on every dollar they spend on Lyft rides.
That's up from the current three rewards point those card holders earn on travel expenses, which include trips with Lyft and Uber. 
JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday raised the price for its Chase Sapphire Reserve card by as much as $100 a year, the bank's cardholder agreement showed. The card now costs between $450 and $550 in annual fees.
The increase in price comes as the bank also adds other new perks to the popular travel rewards card, like free monthly memberships with popular companies like the food delivery service DoorDash. 
Sapphire Reserve customers will also receive a free one-year membership of Lyft's subscription service which at $19.99 a month offers savings on rides and other benefits.
Chase data showed that Sapphire card holders use ride-hailing services at least once a week, Lyft said.
Members of other Chase credit card programs, including its Sapphire Preferred, Sapphire, Ink Preferred, and Ink Plus line, will also receive an increase in rewards points for Lyft rides.

The offers are valid until March 2022, Lyft said.

The S&P 500 gained 0.48%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.67% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.56%.
A sigh of relief swept through the broader market as Trump opted to impose new economic sanctions on Iran rather than call for military action against the Islamic Republic.
""Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned,"" Trump said in a speech following Iran's strikes on several U.S. military bases.
""The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it,"" the president added.
Rising hopes that both nations will seek to de-escalate tensions reduced expectations of oil supply disruption in the Middle East, sending oil prices plunging 5% and keeping energy stocks in red.
Ahead of the speech, oil prices were on the back foot following an unexpected build in weekly crude supplies.
But the plunge in energy was more than offset by a rally in tech, underpinned by gains in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) amid bullish remarks from Wall Street.
Morgan Stanley raised its target on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $189 from $157, on expectations that the tech giant is set to deliver strong performance in the coming year.
Wedbush, meanwhile, said robust iPhone 11 sales during the holiday season and strong AirPods performance should lead to ""clear upside"" in Apple's upcoming quarterly earnings report.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), however, failed to join the broad-based rally, falling 1% after Cowen downgraded shares of the aircraft maker and concerns over its operational fleet continued after one of its jets was involved in a fatal crash in Iran."

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Deere & Co . (N:DE) on Wednesday said it will cut costs and ramp up investment in data-driven agriculture technology and its services business to make itself more profitable.
In a pitch to investors, Chief Executive Officer John May said the measures are expected to boost operating profit margin to 15% by 2022 from 12.5% projected for this year.
The steps, outlined by the company's new leadership, are part of a broader trend in the U.S. manufacturing sector which is facing its deepest slump in more than a decade.
In a bid to smooth earnings volatility, manufacturers such as  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) are slashing costs and focusing on more profitable parts and services businesses.
May, who took over Deere's reins in November, aims to shore up the company's fortunes which have taken a hit from Sino-U.S. trade tensions as well as poor weather in the American farm belt that has slowed equipment purchases by farmers.
The Moline, Illinois-based company reported lower profits in the latest quarter and has warned of lower earnings this year.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced last month that China had agreed to double its pre-trade war purchases of U.S. agricultural products over the next two years as part of a Phase 1 trade deal. Still, Deere expects industry sales of farm equipment in the United States and Canada, its biggest market, to decline about 5% this year.
In response to weak demand, the company has cut production and laid off workers.
May said Deere is reviewing its overseas manufacturing footprint in markets that have peaked or where it has over-invested. He did not provide the names of those facilities.
The company is also carrying out a voluntary separation program for its salaried employees, now projected to result in savings of $120 million, lower than $150 million estimated earlier.
May expects the cuts to add 1 percentage point to Deere's profits by 2022.
The company is aiming to get a similar profit boost from investments in data-driven farming, known as precision agriculture, which enables farmers to plant according to the fertility of the soil, helping reduce input costs and enhance yields.
Similarly, it is betting on its parts and maintenance services business to contribute 50 basis points in added profits over the next two years. The segment currently accounts for a fifth of the company's sales."

(Reuters) - Takata is recalling 10 million replacement air bag inflators in the United States, the largest ever auto safety recall in history, as U.S. regulators consider whether to make it even wider.
The 10 million inflator recall made public Wednesday covers inflators that were a temporary fix. The figure includes some inflators never installed. Several automakers have already initiated additional recalls to replace the recalled inflator with an alternative final part.
Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is assessing whether to compel the recall of tens of millions of additional Takata air bag inflators that have a drying agent. It is also reviewing petitions from General Motors Co (N:GM) to avoid recalling more than 6 million vehicles with Takata inflators.
GM has said it could cost $1.2 billion if it had to recall the vehicles.
Prior to Wednesday, 41.6 million U.S. vehicles equipped with 56 million defective Takata air bags have been recalled because the inflators can explode when deployed. At least 25 deaths worldwide and more than 290 injuries have been linked to faulty Takata inflators.
The Takata recalls cover about 100 million inflators among 19 major automakers worldwide.
NHTSA says the cause of the inflator explosions that can emit deadly fragments is propellant breaking down after long-term exposure to high temperature fluctuations and humidity. The vehicle inflators recalled to date do not have a drying agent.
Under a 2015 consent order, Takata had to provide data to U.S. regulators by Dec. 31 about whether tens of millions of additional so-called desiccated inflators need to be recalled.
Acting NHTSA Administrator James Owens told Reuters the agency was reviewing data on the desiccated inflators and talking to automakers.
""We are going to lean in on safety and if we detect a safety problem we will immediately take action,"" Owens said, adding that the agency could make a decision early in 2020.
An independent group after five years of testing inflators told NHTSA in October there was ""no immediate safety risk"" to the inflators with a drying agent but added ""out of an abundance of caution, we recommend a well-designed monitoring program.""
Owens said NHTSA may announce new monitoring."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) said on Wednesday it will expand its trial in Canada of vegan burgers made by Beyond Meat (O:BYND) as the world's biggest fast food chain tests the viability of a broader rollout.
McDonald's initial 12-week test late last year of its so-called ""P.L.T."" burger at 28 locations in Southwestern Ontario will grow to a total of 52 locations on Jan. 14 and run for another three months.
Analysts, rival fast food companies and plant-based protein producers are watching McDonald's to see whether the P.L.T. is popular enough to justify wider distribution, particularly in the United States, its biggest market.
While other chains have already started selling plant-based meat - including Restaurant Brands International Inc's (TO:QSR) Burger King, White Castle and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN) - a McDonald's contract would likely be the biggest and put the plant-based meat movement front and center in mainstream America.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Beyond Meat rival Impossible Foods is no longer trying to win a deal with McDonald's because it does not currently have the capacity to supply the fast food giant.
Beyond Meat shares, which closed up 12.5% on Tuesday after the news, were down 1.4 percent on Wednesday.
ONTARIO TESTING GROUNDS
Graphic designer Jeff McClinchey had not been to a McDonald’s restaurant since 1999. But in the last couple months, McClinchey – a vegetarian – has been twice to eat the P.L.T.
""I liked it. It hit that nostalgic factor,"" McClinchey told Reuters while shopping at a comic store in London, Ontario, last month.
A report from the Canadian newspaper Financial Post, citing a McDonald's executive, said the test would help the company determine who is buying the sandwich, but that so far the P.L.T. had the right name and recipe. (https:// McDonald's confirmed to Reuters that demand for the item was higher in urban areas, and one franchisee with more rural locations opted out of the second phase of the test.
Southwestern Ontario, particularly the city of London and surrounding areas, has long been the ""guinea pig of Canada"" to test new products, said Gerry McCartney, CEO of the London Chamber of Commerce.
The area, about two hours southwest of Toronto, has the perfect demographic mix as a diverse but hard-to-win market, according to locals and experts interviewed by Reuters.
Traditionally a farming community surrounded by conservative agricultural and industrial areas, it is close to the United States and has an urban core with more liberal pockets.
It has a big university, as well as a number of residents from Europe and other countries, and even boasts Canada's first 24-hour vegan fast food drive-thru restaurant, called Globally Local.
UBS said in December that McDonald's could sell more than 250 million P.L.T. sandwiches annually if it rolled out the product across its nearly 14,000 U.S. outlets, based on the Swiss investment bank's tests that showed McDonald's was selling nearly 100 burgers a day at some outlets."

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran's missile attack on U.S. army bases in Iraq overnight sent gold blasting above $1,600 an ounce, boosted the Japanese yen by almost 1% and oil by $3 a barrel.
But it took just hours for that safe-haven dash to fade and for world equities to resume their climb.
It was the second volte face in under a week following a similar pattern of events after the U.S. killing of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani on Friday. And that mirrored a super-fast roundtrip on markets after Iran-backed rebels attacked Saudi oil facilities in September.
Welcome to the brave new world where it appears that little short of full-fledged world war between nuclear-armed powers would be required to have a durable impact on financial markets. And even then, some begin to wonder.
By the European close on Wednesday, Brent crude oil prices had returned back below levels seen before Soleimani's death on Friday and Wall Street's S&P500 equity index (INX) rallied to new record highs.
At its most basic level, investors appear to believe that Tehran and Washington will avert a broader conflagration. Regionally-contained military blowups and bursts of conflict have proven in recent years not to have a durable impact on either oil supplies and prices nor global economic activity.
Even September's attacks on Saudi oil installations had no lasting effect on crude prices. And beyond the Gulf, years of North Korean nuclear tests and missile launches have not yet escalated nor affected international investment patterns for any significant length of time.
So traders and investors are betting as much on repeated patterns of behavior rather than on amateur geopolitical reasoning.
""The market has taken a view based on a decade's worth of experience that this is not going to escalate out of control,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes.
""It's the same with the economy. We've had an economic cycle with mini-cycles since 2008 but no recession, we've had trade wars that haven't really turned into real trade wars but keep getting postponed.""
And investors who stuck with equities and looked past euro debt crises, North Korean missile tests, Arab Spring revolts, trade wars, Middle East turmoil and unconventional economic policies, have reaped rich returns - world stocks have added more than $25 trillion in value since 2010.
A geopolitical risk index compiled by U.S. Federal Reserve Board researchers Dario Caldara and Matteo Iacoviello rates the Saudi attacks at a relatively high 185 points, but well below the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq that scored 545 points.

OIL CLOUT
For decades, the energy price impact has been the main transmission mechanism from major conflicts - particularly in the Gulf - to the wider economy and world markets. The threat of oil supply disruption has been a shadow on the global economy ever since a quadrupling of oil prices during the 1973 OPEC oil embargo and a 30% jump in 1990.
But oil spikes these days tend to be briefer. That partly reflects the changing nature of energy usage and geographical sources of supplies. U.S. shale oil producers can now step up to offset price spikes stemming from Gulf supply disruptions, regardless of local politics or OPEC action, while the rise of renewable energy sources amid fears of climate change is happening at a rapid pace.
Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth notes that technology developments mean far less oil is needed to produce a dollar of global GDP today.
Donovan also highlighted that back in 1973 energy-producing countries squirreled away extra oil earnings as savings, causing a net shock to global economic demand as that money drained from oil buyers' pockets.
""In 2020, oil sellers spend that money with abandon and so a higher oil price does not mean a big drop, or potentially any sort of drop, in economic demand.""
LEARNING FROM THE PAST
Of course, wars and invasions have driven big market shifts in the past, causing mini-panics and safe-asset buying on fears for business confidence, trade and energy prices.
But the experience over recent decades has been that, all things equal, markets tend to recover quickly and portfolio managers with the stomach to see through short-term lurches do well, even without expensive hedging.
A recent  Schroders  (LON:SDR) report identified the 1990 Gulf War, the 2001 9/11 attacks on New York and the 2003 Iraq invasion as the most monumental geopolitical risk events https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-MARKETS-GEOPOLITICS/0H001QXTJB8F/index.html of the past 30 years.

In 2003, yields on German government bonds, among the world's most trustworthy assets, tumbled almost 70 basis points between March and June; they fell a similar amount in 1990.
""When you look at the last few decades of history, whenever a prolonged war is the more likely outcome, that's when the rush to government bonds takes place,"" said Rabbani Wahhab, senior portfolio manager at London and Capital.
Schroders noted that during periods of extreme risk, a portfolio of ""safe"" assets comprising bonds and gold usually outperformed ""riskier"" equities.
However, it also found that in all these instances shares recovered within months, suggesting that ""if investors are willing or able to ignore volatility, then investing in the risky portfolio represents a better strategy than a safe portfolio.""
ALL CHANGE IN MARKETS
The market context itself has also changed over the decades - most prominently by years of near-zero interest rates and central bank money printing that have inflated prices of high-quality bonds, reduced benchmark borrowing costs and cut what's available to investors.
Shares, meanwhile, have been pumped up by buybacks and abundant private funding that have steadily reduced equity supply over the years. With JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicting equity supply to decline by a further $200 billion this year, many investors have come to view selloffs as a buying opportunity.
""The demand-supply nature of markets has completely changed,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier.
""Central banks have reduced the supply of safe assets and that's rippled out to risky assets. It's a very powerful force."""

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hit record highs after President Donald Trump's comments eased fears of an all-out conflict in the Middle East, as Iran retaliated by firing missiles following the death of an Iranian general last week in a U.S. airstrike.
Trump said at a White House briefing on Wednesday that Iran's missile strikes overnight on military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq had not harmed any Americans and that Tehran appeared to be standing down.
Global markets have been rattled by fears of turmoil in the Middle East after the U.S. killing of influential Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3 prompted the overnight strike from Iran.
U.S. stock futures tumbled 1.7% overnight, but comments from Iran's foreign minister that the country did not seek an escalation and Trump's tweet that ""All is well!"" helped inject some calm early on Wednesday.
""The de-escalation nature of the (Trump) speech is really what the market is focused on,"" said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird.
""It's Trump essentially saying that we're not going to retaliate to the missile attacks last night.""
Trump's latest comments sent the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to all-time highs, previously hit on the first trading day of 2020 on hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal.

The blue-chip Dow was just below its all-time high as Boeing (N:BA) fell 1.3% after its 737-800 jet belonging to a Ukrainian airline burst into flames shortly after take-off from Tehran, killing all 176 people aboard.
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) slid 6.2% as its quarterly profit missed expectations. Shares in rival CVS Health (N:CVS) fell 1.5%.
 Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) gained 2% after the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder beat quarterly profit estimates on lower home prices and mortgage rates.
Adding to the upbeat mood, the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private payrolls jumped by 202,000 jobs last month, much above the 160,000 rise expected by economists polled by Reuters.

655,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 01:17PM ET</span>",Bond Bears See Ray of Light as U.S.-Iran Tensions Appear to Ease,"(Bloomberg) -- The worst-case scenario of a further escalation in the conflict between the U.S. and Iran appears to have been averted for now, but the relief sell-off in haven assets may drive Treasury yields only so high.
The haven trade drove the 10-year U.S. benchmark yield as much as 11 basis points lower during Asia trading Wednesday after Iran fired a volley of missiles on U.S.-Iraqi airbases, in retaliation for an American airstrike that killed a top Iranian general. That flight-to-safety move gave way to a sell-off on hopes of a de-escalation, and President Donald Trump’s announcement in the U.S. morning of further sanctions, but no military action, pushed the benchmark to this week’s high, of 1.86%.
“It didn’t sound to me like there was any further escalation or expected retaliation so I think on net that should be seen as a positive,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
But he still advocates a tactical approach to trading Treasuries for now, with the 10-year likely to stay within its recent ranges as geopolitical tensions persist.
“Even though these comments are somewhat conciliatory, it may not end here,” he said.
The round-trip in yields is fresh evidence of how geopolitical events have counteracted the upward pressure on rates from a brighter U.S. growth outlook. Wednesday brought solid labor data, as a report showed companies added more jobs last month than forecast, ahead of what’s expected to be a healthy payrolls report from the government Friday. That follows Tuesday figures indicating stronger-than-forecast expansion in the U.S. service sector.
Adding to pressure in favor of higher U.S. yields is the recent improvement in Chinese manufacturing data, suggesting global growth may have troughed. The yuan this week reached the strongest level since August.
There’s also a slate of U.S. government debt auctions to absorb. The Treasury will sell $24 billion of 10-year notes at 1 p.m. Washington time, with 30-year bonds ahead Thursday.
In Cabana’s view, a series of catalysts need to line up to set U.S. benchmark yields on an upward trend: further strength in U.S. and global growth and a pickup in inflation. In the meantime, he sees the trade-off between economic and geopolitical developments keeping yields lower.
“These are all reasonable things to anticipate over time, but at present I’d say at least in the market’s mind the balance of risks is skewed to the downside.”

DUBAI/KIEV (Reuters) - A Ukrainian airliner crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, bursting into flames and killing all 176 people on board.
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 crashed hours after Iran fired missiles at bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq, and officials said speculation about what happened was premature. Carrier Ukraine International Airlines said the plane was last serviced two days ago.
Smouldering parts and debris, including shoes and clothes, were strewn across a field southwest of the Iranian capital where rescue workers in face masks laid out scores of body bags. 
Among the victims were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians, 10 Swedes, three Germans and three Britons, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said.
A passenger list https://www.flyuia.com/ua/ua/news/2020/flight-ps752-passenger-list from the airline showed members of the same family were killed, children were on board and many passengers were under 35. A newlywed couple that had gone to Iran to get married were among the Canadian victims. 
Arash Pourzarabi, 26, and Pouneh Gourji, 25, were graduate students in computer science at the University of Alberta. Four members of their wedding party were also on board with another 24 Iranian-Canadians from Edmonton, said Reza Akbari, president of the city's the Iranian Heritage Society.
""Oh god, I can’t believe this,"" Akbari told Reuters. ""It’s shocking to the whole community.""
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was ""shocked and saddened"" and added: ""Our government will continue to work closely with its international partners to ensure that this crash is thoroughly investigated, and that Canadians’ questions are answered.""
It was Kiev-based Ukraine International Airlines' first fatal crash, and the carrier said it was doing everything possible to establish the cause.
Ukraine will send a team of experts to Iran later on Wednesday to investigate the crash, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in the Ukrainian capital. He said he had instructed Ukraine's prosecutor general to open criminal proceedings.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was calling for complete cooperation with any investigation into cause of the crash and was prepared to offer Ukraine all possible assistance.
Under international rules, responsibility for investigating the crash lies with Iran, and Iranian state television said both of the plane's black box voice and data recorders had been found.
The semi-official Mehr news agency quoted the head of Iran's civil aviation organization as saying it was not clear which country Iran would send the black boxes to for analysis of the data, but it would not give them to Boeing.
AMATEUR VIDEO
An amateur video, run by Iranian news agencies and purportedly of the crashing plane, showed a flash in a dark sky descending. It was accompanied by comments that the aircraft was ""on fire"" and then a brighter flash as it appears to hit the ground. Reuters could not authenticate the footage.
Iran had earlier fired missiles at the bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike last week that killed an Iranian military commander.
Some airlines canceled Iran and Iraq flights and re-routed others away from both countries' airspace following the missile strikes.
Safety experts say airliner accidents rarely have a single cause and that it typically takes months of investigation to understand all the factors behind them.
In Paris, the maker of the plane's engines, French-U.S. firm CFM - co-owned by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and France’s  Safran  (PA:SAF) - said speculation regarding the cause was premature.
Iranian TV put the crash down to unspecified technical problems, and Iranian media quoted a local aviation official as saying the pilot did not declare an emergency. 
STATEMENT RESCINDED
An official at Ukraine's embassy in Tehran said Iranian authorities had asked it to rescind an initial statement from Iran based on preliminary information that had blamed the accident on engine failure.
The plane that crashed was a three-year-old Boeing 737-800NG en route to Kiev. Its last scheduled maintenance was on Jan. 6, the airline said.
""We are in contact with our airline customer and stand by them in this difficult time. We are ready to assist in any way needed,"" the manufacturer said in a statement.
The 737-800 is one of the world’s most-flown models with a good safety record and does not have the software feature implicated in crashes of the 737 MAX. Boeing grounded its 737 MAX fleet in March after two crashes that killed 346 people.
Modern aircraft are designed and certified to cope with an engine failure shortly after take-off and to fly for extended periods on one engine. But an uncontained engine failure releasing shrapnel can cause damage to other aircraft systems. 

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it was monitoring developments surrounding the crash.

660,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 12:46PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC proposes governance changes for stock market data feeds,"By John McCrank
(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday took the first step in potentially changing how essential stock market data is governed following years of complaints by brokers that the exchanges that control the data are conflicted in their role.
The SEC voted to issue for public comment a staff proposal to create new rules governing public data feeds that it said would also improve transparency and address inefficiencies in the collection and dissemination of the data.
The proposal would update rules put in place in 2005 that put exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in charge of the governance and operation of three public data feeds showing current best prices and last trades for stocks.
Since the existing rules were put in place, exchanges have created faster, more sophisticated proprietary data feeds that compete against the public feeds. Many larger brokers say they need to pay for those private data feeds, which are often more expensive than the public feeds, in order to remain competitive, and that this has created a two-tiered market.
""Today's proposed order is designed to address issues regarding the dissemination of market data that affect the efficiency and fairness of our markets,"" said SEC Chairman Jay Clayton.
The SEC's proposal, which is subject to a 45-day public comment period, directs the exchanges to create a new governance plan that would form a single public data feed, reduce the influence of large exchange groups in decision-making around the data, and give a bigger say to non-exchange participants.
If the regulator decides to issue an order after receiving public input on the proposal, the exchanges and FINRA would have to create a new governance plan, which would also be published for public comment before the SEC takes it into consideration.
Clayton, an independent, along with Republican Commissioners Elad Roisman and Hester Peirce, voted in favor of the measure, while Democratic Commissioners Robert Jackson and Allison Lee dissented.
""Rather than give investors a real say over the data that drives today's markets, today's release merely invites for-profit exchanges to draft their own rules on these questions,"" Jackson said.

(Reuters) - European shares ended higher on Wednesday after Iran indicated the overnight missile strikes ""concluded"" its retaliation to the U.S. killing of General Qassem Soleimani.
Tehran's attack on U.S. military bases in Iraq initially raised fears of a wider war in the Middle East, spurring a flight to safer assets and causing the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) to fall as much as 0.6%.
However, the benchmark index gradually recovered and closed 0.2% higher as Iran said it did not seek to escalate the confrontation. 
There were no American casualties in the attack and Tehran appeared to be standing down, U.S. President Donald Trump said in the final minutes of European trading hours, lifting U.S. stock indexes to record highs.
""After a very negative initial reaction to the overnight events in the Middle East, the market seems to be picking up hope that the events provide the sufficient base for de-escalation,"" said Ingo Schachel, head of equity research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) outperformed regional bourses as the positive geopolitical development overshadowed an earlier data showing an unexpected fall in industrial orders in November in the country.
France's Airbus (PA:AIR), among the biggest boosts to the pan-regional index, rose 2% as its U.S. rival Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737-800 jet belonging to a Ukrainian airline burst into flames shortly after take-off from Tehran, killing all 176 people aboard.
Airbus shares helped the travel and leisure (SXTP) to lead the charge among European subsectors with its 0.7% gain. On the other hand, Boeing suppliers Senior Plc (L:SNR),  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  Melrose  (L:MRON) slipped between 0.1% and 1.2%.
In Britain, the blue-chip (FTSE) index lagged its European peers, weighed down by losses in shares of energy giants  BP  (L:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) which tracked oil prices lower. 
London's FTSE 250 midcaps index (FTMC) was pulled down 0.8% by declines in real estate companies.

Shares of NMC Health (L:NMC) and  Finablr  (L:FINF) plunged more than 15% each after two major shareholders launched a discounted share sale in the London-listed groups, weeks after NMC was hit by a short-selling attack by U.S. firm Muddy Waters.

664,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 12:16PM ET</span>","Macy's holiday season sales fall less than feared, to close 29 stores","(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) reported a small decline in holiday same-store sales on Wednesday, surprising investors who were bracing for a sharper drop following an earlier profit warning.
The company, which cut its annual profit forecast in November blaming weak international tourism and sluggish mall traffic, reported a 0.6% decline in holiday sales during November and December.
Macy's is among the first major corporate names to report sales for the holiday season, which is seen as a barometer for the health of U.S. consumer spending.
The retailer also plans to shutter 28 Macy's locations and one Bloomingdale's store in the coming weeks, a Macy's spokeswoman said.
She said the closures were part of a routine review of the company's store portfolio. Macy's operates about 860 stores in the United States.
For the full quarter, analysts were expecting a 1.8% decline in same-store sales, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""It's bit of a relief for investors, as they were concerned sales were going to be down more than that,"" Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics told Reuters.
Given the traffic at stores did not look particularly great during the holidays, the sales number looks good, Perkins said. 
He cautioned, however, that heavy discounting during the season could dent the company's margins.
Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said Macy's holiday sales benefited from online purchases and demand for gift products, as well as a complete revamp of about 150 stores with fresh interiors and better merchandise. 
U.S. consumers are increasingly spending more money online rather than queuing up at physical stores during the holiday season, forcing traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to invest in more shopping and delivery options.
U.S. e-commerce sales in the period from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve rose 18.8%, according to a Dec. 25 report by Mastercard Inc (N:MA), while overall holiday retail sales, excluding autos, rose just 3.4%.
Consumer spending in the country is benefiting from wage growth and the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century.
Shares of the company, which rose as much as 5%, were marginally up at $17.78.

665,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brazil prosecutor aims to charge Vale within days over mining waste dam disaster,"By Marta Nogueira and Christian Plumb
BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (Reuters) - A Brazilian state prosecutor expects to bring criminal charges ""in the next few days"" against miner Vale (SA:VALE3) over a mining waste dam collapse that killed at least 259 people, even as the prosecutor's federal counterpart continues to investigate the case.
Andressa de Oliveira Lanchotti, coordinator for the task force of state prosecutors investigating the disaster, told Reuters they expect to indict 15 to 20 people, including executives from Vale and employees from German inspection firm TÜV SÜD - as well as the companies themselves.
""What we can take away from the investigations is there were several factors pointing to risk - the risk was not unknown,"" Lanchotti said, disputing Vale's contention that it had no way of knowing that the dam that unleashed an avalanche of mining waste on the Brazilian town of Brumadinho in January 2019 posed a danger.
Federal police in September proposed criminal charges against Vale, TÜV SÜD and 13 of their employees, accusing the companies of working with falsified documents attesting to the stability of the dam.
Prosecutors believe TÜV SÜD had a vested interest in signing off on the dam's safety so that it could get more work from Vale, which had fired another inspection firm which refused to certify the dam's safety.
""There was a conflict of interest between TÜV SÜD and Vale because TÜV SÜD had lucrative contracts with Vale for other activities, to decommission dams, which makes obvious the regulatory shortcomings here,"" she said.
A Vale spokesman said a panel of experts appointed by its lawyers found that the Brumadinho collapse had happened ""abruptly and without apparent previous signs that could have been detected by geotechnical monitoring instruments usually employed by the global mining industry.""
In the same emailed statement, the spokesman said Vale had hired TÜV SÜD with the understanding that its inspectors would have ""technical responsibilities, independence and autonomy in carrying out its services ... prioritizing safety above all.""
TÜV SÜD declined to comment.
Prosecutors appear eager to unveil charges against Vale ahead of the one-year anniversary of Brazil's deadliest tailings dam disaster later this month, but a leading federal prosecutor told Reuters their investigation was weeks from wrapping up.
The federal prosecutor's office in Minas Gerais state said it had hired geological experts from the University of Catalunya in Spain to examine what triggered the collapse at Brumadinho. That investigation will take until February and could be crucial in establishing Vale's culpability, federal prosecutor Jose Adercio Leite Sampaio said in an interview.
Federal and state prosecutors have pledged to coordinate more closely in the Brumadinho investigation, acknowledging that the probe into Brazil's last big mining disaster - a dam burst at a joint venture between Vale and Anglo-Australian miner BHP Group (AX:BHP) - was undermined by disputes over areas of responsibility.
Prosecutors did not make it clear whether they were planning to charge current or former executives at Vale, which has distanced itself from several people investigated after the Brumadinho disaster. Rescuers have found 259 bodies in the months following the collapse, which swamped nearby buildings, forests and waterways with mud mixed with mining waste. Another 11 people are still missing.
Lanchotti and Sampaio both agreed that Vale may need to make more governance changes to improve risk management practices.
""The federal public prosecutors' office has identified serious risk management and corporate governance problems that show a need for profound changes,"" Sampaio said.
The Vale spokesman said the company ""has always been committed to the safety of people and its structures and continues to improve its risk management processes,"" adding that it had ""provided all documents and information sought by the competent authorities."""
666,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 11:46AM ET</span>","Walgreens misses profit estimates on pharmacy weakness, shares fall 7%","By Manas Mishra and Trisha Roy
(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's (O:WBA) quarterly profit missed Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, hit by lower payments from insurers on drugs sold at its U.S. pharmacies, knocking back its shares and those of rival CVS Health Corp (N:CVS). 
The company sought to reassure investors, saying it would meet its adjusted full-year profit forecast of roughly flat growth, betting on cost cuts and a harsh flu season. 
But shares fell nearly 7% to $55, dragging down those of CVS 2%, as investors worried that the pressure on reimbursement rates from insurers was likely to hurt profits further. 
Walgreens has also been struggling with disappointing performance in its Boots UK unit and intense competition from the arrival of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) in the pharmacy market in the past year. 
To cushion the impact, Walgreens has closed stores and launched cross-selling partnerships with companies including grocer  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and weight-loss clinic operator Jenny Craig.
""The changes in our markets are obscuring some of the positive impact we are having,"" said Chief Executive Officer Stefano Pessina. ""This will not be the case forever.""
Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers in the United States have been seeking to push more of the cost of the drugs they pay for - and reimburse - to the pharmacy chains that actually deliver them to insured consumers. 
In recent years, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company had benefited from steep falls in generic drug prices that helped it offset the pressure from lower reimbursement rates, but such declines have slowed in the past year. 
""Profitability and sales growth may be hard to come by for the foreseeable future in this era of reimbursement pressure and a rapidly changing health care environment,"" said Edward Jones analyst John Boylan.
Walgreens said on Wednesday it had completed 114 of the 200 planned namesake store closures in the United States and 28 of a scheduled 200 Boots UK closures. The company's cost cutting program, launched in 2018, aims to save more than $1.8 billion annually by 2022. 
Boots, acquired in 2014, has struggled with competition from online retailers, as well as a broader decline of the UK high street, which has seen dozens of major retailers collapse in recent years. 
Excluding items, Walgreens earned $1.37 per share, short of estimates of $1.41. 
Revenue rose 1.6% to $34.34 billion, but missed analysts' estimate of $34.60 billion. 

Shares have fallen 15.3% in the past 12 months, making them the worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrials Average index (DJI).

The S&P 500 headed for its second advance in three days after Trump said Iran appears to be standing down. Treasuries were mixed after spiking overnight following Iranian airstrikes on American bases. Oil fell below $61 a barrel in New York, pulling down energy shares.
The Nasdaq indexes notched all-time intraday highs as tech led the advance in equities. In company news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. slumped after one of its planes crashed in Iran. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) sank 6% after the drugstore giant’s profits slid, while  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN). advanced as its earnings topped estimates.
“Even after this initial retaliation, the path of least resistance appears to be towards de-escalation from here on,” said Sandip Bhagat, Whittier Trust’s chief investment officer. “It may also be useful to bear in mind that previous Middle East strife has historically not left a lasting impact on risk assets.”
Markets settled into an uneasy calm, with investors betting that the lack of American casualties will give the president incentive to de-escalate the situation that flared with Friday’s killing of a ibtop Iranian general. The nervousness is denting optimism spurred by the improving outlook for global commerce, with a Sino-American trade deal expected to be signed next week.
If the calm holds, investors will likely increase their attention on the nonfarm jobs report due Friday. A gauge of private employment beat expectations Wednesday.

""It's not contemplated,"" Lopez Obrador said at his daily press conference when asked if his government was considering offering auctions for oil and gas blocks.
Lopez Obrador, who has been in office for a year, has shifted sharply away from some of the business-friendly policies of his predecessor, centrist President Enrique Pena Nieto, who enacted a sweeping energy market liberalization in 2013.

The S&P 500 index rose 0.35%, the Nasdaq Compositeclimbed 0.39% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average underperformed, rising just 0.22%.
While the initial reaction to the Iranian launches was one of panic that this would result in an escalation in the regional conflict, the tone quickly became calmer as President Donald Trump tweeted that “all is well” and that he would be making a statement later in the day. The Iranian foreign minister also indicated that his country did not seek an escalation of the conflict and that their response had been ”proportionate”.
With this in mind, investors turned back towards fundamentals, with the release of the ADP employment data showing companies adding 202,000 positions to private payrolls. The total was well above the 160,000 consensus estimate and now puts the focus on the official nonfarm payrolls count that will be released Friday. Economists expect the Labor Department’s tally to show a gain of 160,000.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A private investigator from the firm tasked with tailing former  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) banker Iqbal Khan has countered Khan's legal action with criminal complaints against the banker, his wife and the police, Swiss prosecutors said on Wednesday.
Khan, who left Credit Suisse in July to became rival UBS's (S:UBSG) co-head of wealth management, filed a criminal complaint in Switzerland following a confrontation with private detectives tailing him and his wife on Sept. 17.
The scandal led to an investigation by Switzerland's bank watchdog into Credit Suisse's conduct and criminal proceedings in Zurich which remain ongoing.
The Swiss Investigo detective agency which was hired to follow Khan has said the ensuing publicity caused it severe reputational and financial damage.
An Investigo employee has since submitted a criminal complaint against Khan and his wife to the state prosecutors office handling the criminal proceedings, a spokesman for Zurich prosecutors said, adding that the complaint was under review.
The prosecutors said they were also reviewing a separate criminal complaint by the Investigo employee against members of the Zurich police lodged shortly before Christmas, but declined comment on the specific accusations made in both complaints.
A legal representative for Khan said he stood by his version of events. Investigo did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
A spokesman for Zurich's local cantonal police declined to comment on the complaints, which were first reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger earlier on Wednesday."

With demand for smart phones and other hardware peaking, Apple has been striving to boost sales from purchases of apps and subscription services like its newly launched Apple TV+ streaming service or Apple Care maintenance packages.
The company said https://apple.co/37WG48P1.42 that between Dec. 24, 2019, and Jan. 1, 2020, its customers spent $1.42 billion in the App Store, a 16% increase over the previous year, and $386 million on Jan. 1 alone, a 20% increase.
The number of users of the News app rose nearly 18% from a year ago, although the company did not break out subscriber numbers for the Apple News+ service, which costs $9.99 per month.
The numbers also point to a big shift in spending in the Thanksgiving to Christmas holiday season in the United States, with consumers splurging on apps and online shopping rather than in brick-and-mortar stores.
Mastercard Inc's (N:MA) data tracking retail sales from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve showed U.S. shoppers spent almost a fifth more online during this year's holiday shopping season than a year ago, accounting for 15% of all retail sales.
The App Store growth numbers were roughly in line with the overall trend for Apple's services segment revenue, which rose 16% to $46.3 billion in its most recent fiscal year ended in September. In comparison, iPhone sales fell 14% to $142.4 billion in the same period.
Apple keeps between 15% and 30% of the sales through its App Store, depending on whether users buy software as a one-time purchase or recurring subscription.
The company launched several new services in 2019, including the streaming service, a video game service and a credit card.

Walgreens Boots (NASDAQ:WBA). The drugstore’s first-quarter results came in well short of Wall Street expectations, with its adjusted earnings per share at $1.37 lower than the $1.41 expected by analysts, on average. These figures were hurt by lower payments from insurers on drugs sold.

675,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 08:32AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs Says 2020 Could Be Good Year for U.K. Stock Market,"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists believe 2020 bodes well for U.K. equities -- with a few caveats.
“In 2019, U.K. assets have done well as risks have receded,” said Goldman strategists led by Peter Oppenheimer. “For 2020, we expect the outperformance to continue as the U.K. delivers better growth.”
U.K. stocks outperformed the European benchmark at the end of last year after the decisive victory of the Conservatives fueled optimism that the government can complete Brexit and end the uncertainty that has repelled investors. Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday to discuss a free-trade agreement, which he wants to conclude by the end of 2020.
Goldman strategists are particularly keen on U.K. stocks with domestic exposure in light of the labor market’s resilience and increased political clarity, and predict the narrowing of their 20% valuation discount to international peers. At the same time, they recognize that the upside from current levels is limited and many risks persist.
“Our outlook remains subject to significant risks, in particular the scope and timing of negotiations on the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU, and the ability of the U.K. economy to recover from the current slump,” the strategists said.
European Union leaders have warned it’s highly unlikely that negotiators will be able to complete the kind of trade deal Johnson wants in the 11 months between Brexit day on Jan. 31 and the December deadline. This sets up a fresh potential cliff-edge for a no-deal split at the end of 2020, although this isn’t Goldman’s base scenario.
Investors have been putting their cash into both domestically and internationally-oriented U.K. stocks by piling into exchange-traded funds. The iShares Core FTSE 100 UCITS ETF has seen about 27 million pounds ($35 million) in new inflows so far this month, while the Vanguard FTSE 250 UCITS ETF has attracted about 17 million pounds after seeing a record inflow of 661 million pounds in December.
Bloomberg Intelligence’s Tim Craighead also added his vote of confidence for U.K. equities, saying that amid the flare-up in Middle Eastern tensions, the FTSE 100 can provide “a safe haven” because of its skew to energy and defensive equities."

678,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 07:04AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Expected to Edge Higher,"Investing.com - Wall Street is expected to open slightly higher Wednesday, judging by the U.S. equity futures, as investors take a more sanguine view of Iran's attack on U.S.-led forces in Iraq overnight.
The futures had indicated sharp market moves lower, but these losses have been bought into as fears have abated that the missile strikes would lead to an immediate escalation of military action in the region.
Futures for the S&P 500, down almost 2% at one point, were actually trading 0.23% higher by 0623 ET, while futures for the Nasdaq were 0.19% higher. 
The futures for the Dow have underperformed, dropping 0.07%, weighed by losses in the futures contract of   Boeing Co   (NYSE:BA) after an aeroplane manufactured by the company and operated by Ukrainian International Airlines crashed in Iran. Both Ukrainian and Iranian officials indicated that they suspected a mechanical issue.
Hopes that these attacks would be the end of the direct military confrontation between the U.S. and Iran were boosted by a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump that “all is well” and that he would be making a statement later in the day. The Iranian foreign minister also indicated that his country did not seek an escalation of the conflict and that their response had been ”proportionate”.
As investors digest the possible deescalation of the conflict, thoughts turn back to the country’s underlying economic circumstances. The recent non-manufacturing ISM index showed continued strength from the dominant services sector while the Federal Reserve is widely expected to remain on the sidelines at its meeting latest this month after easing interest rates three times last year.
With this in mind, investors will look forward to the release of the ADP non-farm employment release for December later today. This is often used as a gauge as to how Friday's key employment data looks. It is expected to show continued employment growth with 160,000 more jobs added, compared with 67,000 jobs added the previous month."
679,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 06:37AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Watch on Wednesday, Jan 8","Investing.com - Markets are regaining some poise following sharp moves overnight after Iran's attack on U.S.-led forces in Iraq fueled fears that the strikes would lead to an escalation in the standoff between Washington and Tehran. U.S. stock futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street, but Dow futures are weighed down by a drop in shares of Boeing in the wake of another deadly plane crash. Oil prices have trimmed back overnight gains but remain higher, while gold is holding near new seven-year highs. Here’s what you need to know to start your day.
Markets shrug off U.S.- Iran tensions
Market jitters eased on Wednesday following frenzied early trading after a rocket attack by Iran on U.S. forces in Iraq raised the specter of a spiraling Middle East conflict.
Hopes grew the U.S. would stop short of strong retaliation after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted ""All is well!"", and ""So far, so good!"".
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also tweeted that the Iranians ""do not seek escalation or war"".
Iran's missile attack came early on Wednesday, hours after the funeral of an Iranian commander who was killed by a U.S. drone strike last week.

U.S. futures regain ground, but Boeing crash weighs on Dow

U.S. stock futures clawed back their early steep losses, with the S&P 500 futures contract rising 10 points, or 0.3% by 7:30 AM ET (11:30 GMT), while Nasdaq 100 futures rose a similar amount. But Dow futures struggled to make headway, weighed down by a drop in shares of Dow component Boeing (NYSE:BA) in premarket trade.
Boeing shares were hit by news that a Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 airliner burst into flames shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people aboard in a crash that an initial report blamed on engine failure.
A spokesman for the manufacturer said it was gathering more information.
The 737 does not have the software feature implicated in crashes of the 737 MAX. Boeing grounded its 737 MAX fleet in March after two crashes that killed 346 people.
Safe-haven demand wanes
Investor demand for safe haven assets waned as the knee jerk reaction in markets to the Iran strikes unwound. Gold which earlier brushed through $1,600 an ounce, eased to $1,582.
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes stood at 1.811%, down from a U.S. close of 1.825% on Tuesday, but well off session lows around 1.705%.
On currency markets, the attacks had sent the yen spiraling to three-month highs beyond 107.7 per dollar but gave up all those gains. Another safe-haven currency, the Swiss franc, also gave up gains.
Oil pares gains, inventory data awaited
Oil prices were higher but gave up most of their early gains as fears over the prospect of supply disruptions in the Middle East receded.
Global benchmark Brent crude was up 48 cents to $68.75 by 7:30 AM ET (11:30 GMT), after earlier rising to their highest level since mid-September 2019 at $71.75.
U.S. crude futures were last at $62.97, having earlier hit $65.85, the highest since late April last year.
The Energy Information Administration is expected to report a drop of about 3.6 million barrels when it issues official stockpile numbers at 10:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT), according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Private sector hiring data ahead
ADP employment figures are due out at 9:15 AM ET (14:15 GMT) ahead of Friday’s closely watched government nonfarm payrolls report for December.
Economists are predicting a rise of 160,000 in payrolls for the month, up from the tepid rise of 67,000 seen in November.
The market is looking for about the same rise for nonfarm payrolls when the Labor Department weighs in with official figures.

680,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 06:31AM ET</span>",'Shot across the bow': U.S. steps up pressure on UK ahead of Huawei decision,"By Jack Stubbs and Alexandra Alper
LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is making a final pitch to Britain ahead of a UK decision on whether to upgrade its telecoms network with Huawei equipment, amid threats to cut intelligence-sharing ties, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Britain is expected to make a final call on how to deploy Huawei equipment in its future 5G networks later this month, weighing U.S.-led allegations that the equipment could be used for Chinese state spying against Britain's relationship with Beijing and industry warnings that banning the firm outright would cost billions of dollars. 
Huawei, the world's largest maker of mobile networking equipment, has repeatedly denied the allegations. A company spokesman said UK lawmakers had confirmed Huawei equipment would not be deployed in networks used for intelligence sharing.
""Our 5G equipment does not pose a threat to information security,"" he said. ""We are confident the UK government will take an evidence-based approach when making its decision about Huawei's inclusion in the 5G network.""
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to press British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab over Huawei at a meeting in Washington on Thursday, the sources said.
Ahead of the decision, Washington had also planned to send a delegation, including deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, to meet with British officials this week, sources said. But the trip was cancelled at the last minute, two of the people said, due to bad weather. 
Last month, the United States also passed legislation that included a provision bolstering threats to restrict intelligence-sharing with allies that use Huawei equipment.
Washington is seen to be ""cocking the pistol,"" said a person with knowledge of the British government's position on Huawei. ""What's unclear is how, when or indeed if it will actually be fired.""
A UK government spokesman said: ""The security and resilience of the UK's telecoms networks is of paramount importance. The government continues to consider its position on high-risk vendors and a decision will be made in due course.""
The U.S. State Department and National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Britain is a key battleground in the geopolitical tug-of-war over Huawei. Officials decided in principle last year to block the company from critical parts of the 5G network but give it limited access to less sensitive parts. A final decision has yet to be made public.
A provision of the U.S. 2020 defence spending law, signed by President Donald Trump in December, directs intelligence agencies to consider the use of telecoms and cybersecurity infrastructure ""provided by adversaries of the United States, particularly China and Russia,"" when entering intelligence-sharing agreements with foreign countries.
The provision, added by Republican Senator Tom Cotton, was aimed in particular at members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance made up of the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and was intended as a ""a first shot across the bow,"" said a person familiar with the matter.
An aide to Cotton said the senator's team is working on a new draft bill that could be released this month and would ""significantly restrict"" intelligence-sharing with countries that use Huawei equipment in their 5G networks, following through on earlier U.S. threats to do so. 

""I'm profoundly concerned about the possibility that close allies, including the UK, might permit the Chinese Communist Party effectively to build their highly sensitive 5G infrastructure,"" Cotton told Reuters.

DUBAI (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) shares fell to a new low on Wednesday after Iran launched missiles against U.S. targets in Iraq, but Gulf debt markets were fairly stable, as some had feared stronger retaliation from Iran.
Saudi Aramco opened at 34 riyals ($9.06), its lowest since it began trading on Dec. 11, putting the market value of the company at around $1.8 billion, down from a peak of $2.06 trillion on Dec 12.
Aramco’s shares fell in the final couple of weeks of 2019 because reality kicked in among investors, but the recent weakness was caused by geopolitical tensions, said Jason Tuvey, a senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
Aramco shares are down almost 12% from a high of 38.70 riyals on Dec. 12, but still above the IPO price of 32 riyals, which valued the company at $1.7 trillion.
Gulf stocks were also pulled down by the conflict between the United States and Iran, which attacked U.S. targets in Iraq on Wednesday after a U.S. drone strike last week killed the Iranian commander Qassem Soleiman.
But bonds issued by Gulf governments were fairly stable, and credit default swaps - used to insure against the risk of a sovereign debt default - were unchanged.
""The Iran retaliation seems to be a non-escalation, which is why the markets are not widening. I think once this is confirmed, we might see a small relief rally in the region,"" said Zeina Rizk, director of fixed income asset management at Dubai's Arqaam Capital.
Bonds issued by Saudi Arabia - Iran's regional foe - were only marginally weaker, particularly on the long end of the curve. Five-year CDS conventional spreads were up only 1 basis point, according to IHS Markit.
Aramco said on Tuesday Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) may stabilize its shares, but so far no price stabilization transaction have occurred since the stock began trading. The stabilization period ends on Thursday.
Aramco raised $25.6 billion in its IPO, making it the biggest flotation in the world, exceeding  Alibaba  Group's (N:BABA) $25 billion deal in 2014. But foreign investors were wary of investing in Aramco because of concerns over valuations.
""The tensions between the United States and Iran is one of the risks people saw with concentrated operations in the Middle East,"" said Oswald Clint, senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
Aramco's facilities were attacked in September in a strike that temporarily shut down 5.7 million barrels per day of output - more than 5% of global oil supply.
Morningstar, which initiated its coverage of Aramco last month, said its fair value of Aramco was $1.4 trillion."

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday and U.S. equity futures pointed to weakness on Wall Street after Iran's attack on U.S.-led forces in Iraq, but earlier sharp market moves were starting to fade as fears abated that the raid would lead to an immediate military escalation.
Hopes grew the United States would stop short of strong retaliation after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted ""All is well!"", and ""So far, so good!"".
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also tweeted that the Iranians ""do not seek escalation or war"".
Futures for the S&P500, down almost 2% at one point, were trading just 0.10% lower by 0830 GMT, while Asian equities closed off their lows and Japan's safe-haven yen stabilized.
Oil remained around 1% higher while gold held at new seven-year highs after the missile attack on the Ain Al-Asad air base and another in Erbil in Iraq, hours after the funeral of an Iranian commander who was killed by a U.S. drone strike last week .
A U.S. official said the United States was not aware of any casualties from the strikes. Trump is expected to make a statement later on Wednesday.
""The live situation was optically quite dramatic but the important thing to focus on is the no-human-casualty dimension which gives ample space to de-escalate the situation,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.
""The Trump factor is the random factor but what's visible is that no one wants war and that's what markets are focusing on.""
A pan-European equity index opened 0.5% lower though it remains just 1.2% off record highs hit at the end of 2019, its losses limited by a half-percent gain in energy shares. MSCI's index of global equities pulled back 0.2%.
Futures for all three U.S. indexes were lower but they had clawed back most of their earlier falls.
Asian losses were greater, with Chinese shares closing more than 1% lower, Japan's Nikkei losing 1.6% and an MSCI ex-Japan Asian benchmark falling 0.6%.
Some reckon markets are now in wait-and-see mode, with a hawkish statement from Trump or more attacks by Iran the likely driver of the next stage of the risk selloff.
""If you see U.S. treasuries rallying a bit this morning, expect them to rally quite a bit further should there be a forceful response from the United States, which I'd imagine there would be...from a market perspective I think this one could run and run,"" Rob Carnell, Asia-Pacific chief economist at ING in Singapore.
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes stood at 1.7951, down from a U.S. close of 1.825% on Tuesday, but well off session lows around 1.705%. German 10-year yields were at minus 0.287% versus an earlier low of minus 0.299%
U.S. 10-year Treasury futures had earlier peaked at their highest level since November, and were last up 0.18%.
On currency markets, the attacks had sent the yen spiraling to three-month highs beyond 107.7 per dollar but gave up all those gains to trade flat at 108.4. Another safe-haven currency, the Swiss franc, also gave up knee-jerk gains.
""If the market was really worried that the end of the world was nigh, dollar/yen would have collapsed, and that's clearly not been the case,"" said Stuart Oakley, global head of flow FX at Nomura in Singapore.
The euro was 0.2 weaker, buying $1.1137 and the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, was flat lower at 97.0.
The buying of gold and oil also eased as the trading session wore on - global benchmark Brent crude futures which had shot $70 per dollar to their highest since mid-September, were last up 0.5% at $68.1 per barrel.
Gold which earlier brushed through $1,600 an ounce, eased to $1,582. [GOL/]

684,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 03:58AM ET</span>","'Flawed, biased': Ghosn lawyers blast Nissan before news conference","By Chris Gallagher and Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Fugitive ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn's lawyers opened fire on the car maker on Wednesday, hours before he was scheduled to hold a highly anticipated news conference, accusing it of using a ""flawed, biased"" internal probe to engineer his arrest.
The international legal team said in a statement that Nissan Motor Co was trying to prevent Ghosn from more closely integrating the Japanese company and its French alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), which he also formerly headed.
Ghosn's Japanese lawyers, meanwhile, despite their client having vanished from the country on Dec. 29, blocked Tokyo prosecutors from seizing a computer Ghosn had used.
The once-feted executive, who was awaiting trial in Tokyo on charges of financial misconduct and is now in Lebanon which has no extradition treaty with Japan, was allowed to use internet only under his lawyers' supervision under his bail conditions.
Based on attorney-client privilege, ""we refused to allow them access to the (local lawyers') office and asked them to leave"", said an official with the Tokyo law firm.
Ghosn has said that he fled a ""rigged"" Japanese justice system after authorities delayed his trial into 2021. 
His daring escape involved slipping away from his Tokyo residence, crossing Japan on a bullet train and being smuggled onto charter jets that delivered him from Osaka to his childhood home of Lebanon via Istanbul.
Ghosn is expected to hold a news conference in Beirut at 10 p.m. Japan time (1300 GMT). He has spoken in his defense in court and issued a video statement of his innocence since his initial arrest in November 2018, but has not spoken openly with reporters or otherwise publicly defended himself.
Ghosn has said he will fight to restore his reputation. 
His international lawyers said Nissan ""never once"" tried to interview the executive or share with him evidence it had accumulated against him.
Turkish and Japanese authorities are investigating how Ghosn was smuggled out to Beirut. Interpol has issued a ""red notice"" seeking his arrest. 
Japanese authorities on Monday issued an arrest warrant for Ghosn's wife, Carole, for alleged perjury in connection with her husband's financial dealings. 
Carole told French newspaper Le Parisien that Japanese prosecutors were ""hoping to put pressure on my husband"" ahead of his press conference in Lebanon.
The statement from Ghosn's legal team seeks to focus attention on his claim that he was the victim of a coup by Nissan executives who opposed giving up more authority to Renault.
'PERVERSION OF THE TRUTH'
Nissan said an internal investigation found that Ghosn had engaged in personal use of company money and had under-reported his income in violation of Japanese law.
Ghosn's lawyers said Nissan's claim of ""a robust, thorough internal investigation"" is a ""gross perversion of the truth"". 
The investigation ""was initiated and carried out for the specific, predetermined purpose of taking down Carlos Ghosn to prevent him from further integrating Nissan and Renault, which threatened the independence of Nissan"", the lawyers wrote.
Ghosn has denied all charges against him, saying he was the victim of ""backstabbing"" and ""conspiracy"" by Nissan executives.
Ghosn's legal team also accused Nissan of allowing Hari Nada, an executive ""whose own conduct was the subject of the investigation"", to run the probe of Ghosn. 
The statement also charged that Latham & Watkins, the law firm that assisted Nissan's investigation, was not independent because it has long acted as outside counsel for the company.
Ghosn's lawyers said Nissan's investigation failed to uncover evidence that then-CEO Hiroto Saikawa had also benefited from improper compensation. 
Saikawa resigned last year after admitting he had been overpaid in violation of internal procedures.
Nissan said it had no further comment its Tuesday statement.
In the past, the automaker has said it cannot comment on the specifics of the investigation since the company itself was also the subject of a criminal investigation.

Japan's ambassador to Lebanon, Takeshi Okubo, met Lebanese President Michel Aoun on Tuesday, calling Ghosn's flight to Lebanon ""deeply regrettable"" and requesting cooperation from Beirut, according to a Japanese foreign ministry statement.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia’s former prime minister, Najib Razak, allegedly sought help from the United Arab Emirates' crown prince to fake evidence to cover up for the 1MDB scandal, according to audio clips revealed by Malaysian anti-graft officials on Wednesday.
Najib rejected the allegations and the UAE government communication office, the National Media Council, which also represents the palace, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) played audio clips for the media of nine phone conversations from 2016 that it believes are linked to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) multi-billion dollar scandal.
Besides Najib, the MACC said UAE Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Najib's wife Rosmah Mansor, and Malaysian and Emirati officials were on the calls.
MACC chief Latheefa Koya said the audio clips, which were handed to the agency anonymously earlier this month, were proof of a “high-level criminal conspiracy” to cover up wrongdoing.
Latheefa said forensics showed that the nine recordings were authentic and would be shared with the police and other authorities for further investigation.
Najib told reporters on Wednesday he was ""shocked by this revelation"" and is looking at legal options as the audio clips would have allegedly been recorded while he was the head of government.
""I'm studying the content and I have referred this matter to my lawyers. This has never been done in the history of this country,” he said. Najib did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the recordings.
Najib faces 42 criminal charges in five separate trials related to the alleged theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB, the subject of investigations in at least six countries including the United States, Singapore, and Switzerland. He has plead not guilty.
Malaysian and U.S. authorities say about 4.5 billion U.S. dollars was misappropriated from 1MDB, co-founded by Najib in 2009.
Latheefa told a news conference that the audio recordings raised issues such as ""abuse of power, criminal conspiracy, obstruction of justice, compromising national security, fabrication of false evidence through foreign aides and connivance”.
In one recording, Najib allegedly asked the crown prince to help fabricate a loan agreement to show that Najib’s stepson, Riza Aziz, had received financing from UAE state fund International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) and not from money siphoned from 1MDB.
“The premise is relatively small, if there can be an agreement with Sheikh Mansour to have a loan agreement signed… that will show that it is a legitimate financing package, it’s not money laundering,” Najib allegedly said on the audio clip, referring to UAE deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who was then chairman of IPIC.
A lawyer for Riza, whose firm produced 2013 Hollywood movie The Wolf of Wall Street, did not respond to a request for comment. UAE fund Mubadala Investment Co., formed after a merger between IPIC and Mubadala Development Co. in 2017, declined to comment.

HONG KONG/BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - CITIC Ltd (HK:0267), the main listed arm of Chinese state-owned conglomerate CITIC Group, plans to sell a 22% stake in McDonald's Corp's (N:MCD) mainland China and Hong Kong business, which is likely to be bought by the group's private equity arm.
The Hong Kong-listed company aims to raise at least 2.17 billion yuan ($312 million) through the sale, according to a company filing to the China Beijing Equity Exchange on Wednesday.
CITIC Capital, the group's flagship alternative investment arm which manages over $26 billion in assets, would likely become the buyer, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The sale is set to be finalised by early February, said one of the people who declined to be named as the information was private.
CITIC Ltd said the transaction is purely a ""commercial decision"" and it will continue to work for the development of McDonald's business in China along with its partners. CITIC Capital said it is ""actively participating"" in the bidding process.
McDonald's said the transaction would not affect its business strategy and daily operations in mainland China and Hong Kong.
The deal comes months after CITIC Capital raised $2.8 billion in its fourth China buyout fund, the firm's biggest private equity fund to date, bolstering its ability to cut deals in the world's second-largest economy.
CITIC Ltd is selling the 22% stake via Fast Food Holdings Ltd, a holding firm that it set up with CITIC Capital for the combined controlling stake of 52% in McDonald's China and Hong Kong business.
McDonald's Corp in early 2017 agreed to sell 80% of such business to CITIC Ltd (HK:0267), CITIC Capital and  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) for $2.08 billion, saying at the time that they hoped tying up with local partners could speed up growth in China.
CITIC Ltd held 32% of the business, with CITIC Capital and Carlyle holding 20% and 28%, respectively. McDonald's retained the remaining 20%, the companies said in a statement at the time.
After the stake sale, CITIC Ltd will retain 10% of the business.
In late 2017, the U.S. fast food giant changed its registered business name https://reut.rs/37VX7rB to ""Golden Arches (China) Co Ltd"" in China and planned to nearly double the number of its outlets in mainland China to 4,500 by 2022."

""It's a serious social experiment,"" said Maezawa on YouTube, adding he hopes to attract interest from academics and economists.
Maezawa, who is to be the first private passenger to fly around the moon with Elon Musk's SpaceX, is known for his high spending on art and sports cars but also has a predilection for musing on ideas like a world without money.
He tied the giveaway to the idea of basic income, or the theory of providing a periodic no-strings-attached payment to all citizens, that has gained traction in some political circles and is backed by Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang.
""Basic means a regular minimum amount offering a sense of security, what Maezawa is offering is totally different,"" said Toshihiro Nagahama, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
Maezawa said that given that he ""has the money and free time"" to make the payments, he felt the need to try and inspire greater debate over the merits of the theory in Japan.
The idea of a universal basic income has gained support over fears technology such as artificial intelligence will wipe out large numbers of jobs but that concern is for now less pronounced in Japan with its tight labor market, said Nagahama.
Its the second, larger, giveaway by the entrepreneur, who in November secured a $900 million payday through the sale of his online fashion business Zozo Inc (T:3092) to SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).
Maezawa, who recently grabbed headlines after his split from actress girlfriend Ayame Goriki, has gathered almost 7 million followers on Twitter with his mix of displays of conspicuous consumption and folksy pronouncements on the meaning of life.
YouTube is the latest online outlet for the businessman, with videos including a tour of his private jet, a visit to the barber to dye his hair and updating his bank book after November's windfall.
The debate over basic income comes as income inequality continues to grow in the United States, where in recent years some of its wealthiest entrepreneurs, from Microsoft (O:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates to investor Warren Buffet, have pledged to give away most of their wealth."

692,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Impossible Foods has stopped McDonald's burger talks, shares of Beyond Meat jump","By Richa Naidu and Hilary Russ
SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Impossible Foods is no longer trying to win a coveted deal to supply McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) with plant-based burgers, telling Reuters it cannot produce enough of its imitation meat to partner with the world's No. 1 fast-food chain.
It is the latest twist in the battle of imitation-meat makers hoping to convince more restaurants to offer their patties. But it was unclear how far talks had progressed with McDonald's, which declined to comment on the discussions.
Shares of Impossible rival Beyond Meat (O:BYND) surged on Tuesday, closing 12.5% higher, after Reuters reported that Impossible was no longer in talks with McDonald's.
The stock had risen earlier in the day on Impossible's unveiling of its plant-based pork products at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday, spurring further optimism about the sector.
Referring to McDonald's, Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown told Reuters in an interview that ""it would be stupid for us to be vying for them right now ... Having more big customers right now doesn't do us any good until we scale up production.""
Impossible Foods and its rivals are duking it out over partnerships with fast-food chains to cash in on the roughly $3,500 per person average that Americans spend each year on food away from home.
The privately held, Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods teamed up with Burger King last year to launch its soy-based Impossible Whopper in the United States. Impossible Foods is now working to more than double production instead of trying to win a deal the size of McDonald's, Brown said.
""I wish we had vastly more capacity than we do right now because the demand is high,"" he said. Impossible Foods said it had previously met with McDonald's but declined to disclose details about when it decided it would be unable to support a potential deal.
In late September, McDonald's launched a 12-week test of a P.L.T. burger in Canada, using patties made by Beyond Meat. But McDonald's has yet to offer a plant-based burger as a regular feature on its menu at any of its roughly 14,000 U.S. outlets.
""The P.L.T. is a craveable plant-based burger with a patty recipe that is made by McDonald's, for McDonald's,"" the fast-food chain said in a statement. It declined to provide any specifics on the results of the Canada test.
Beyond Meat told Reuters that talks with McDonald's are going ""very well"" and that its new and upcoming facilities around the world are guaranteed to help it keep up with demand - not just in the United States, but globally.
""We would have to work with them (McDonald's) on timing but, yes, we would be able to meet their demand globally,"" Beyond Meat’s chief growth officer, Chuck Muth, said last month in an interview at the Los Angeles-based company's office.
CAPACITY ISSUES
Beyond Meat, which is valued at about $5 billion after its IPO in May, weathered supply issues in 2017 and 2018, when hamburger chain A&W Canada ran out of Beyond Burgers soon after launching nationwide. But Muth said recently announced facilities in Canada and the Netherlands would prevent future snafus.
Beyond Meat, whose products are made with pea protein, told Reuters in November that it aims to have production up and running in Asia by the end of next year.
""Beyond Meat doesn't want to drop the ball while there is amazing awareness building in the market, and they need to balance that with not over-committing themselves,"" said Dan Altschuler Malek, managing partner at Beyond Meat investor Unovis Partners. ""The industry will continue to talk about pressure on supply for years – not because output hasn't increased but because consumer demand continues to exceed expectations.""
McDonald's typically works with multiple suppliers to provide components for major menu items like burgers and French fries. Other fast-food companies - including Yum! Brands’ (N:YUM) KFC and Dunkin Brands – have tested and rolled out plant-based versions of items on their menus, made by dominant suppliers Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods.
Impossible Foods declined to comment on when it believes it might have enough supply or manufacturing capacity to partner with McDonald's.
""When we are ready to do it, we would certainly like them to be a customer,"" Impossible's CEO, Brown, said. ""Right now, if McDonald's said they wanted us to be in all the restaurants, we'd have to say 'Sorry, we can't do it.'""
Impossible Foods has had capacity issues that have hurt customers in the past. In June, hamburger chain White Castle suffered a month-long shortage of Impossible Slider patties, for instance."
693,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 11:28PM ET</span>",Stocks Pare Losses as Iran Says Attack Concludes: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks and U.S. equity futures pared losses and crude oil came off its highs after Iran assured that its strike on U.S. facilities in Iraq Wednesday didn’t mean it was seeking a war, and President Donald Trump declared “all is well.”
Traders coped with a volatile session, with futures on the S&P 500 Index tumbling as much as 1.7% in the wake of Iran’s rocket attack on two U.S.-Iraqi airbases. Japan’s stocks slid as much as 2.4% at one point, and crude oil soared 4.7% in New York; gold punched through $1,600 an ounce for the first time since 2013. Hopes that hostilities might be done for now then triggered a reversal of much of those moves. U.S. futures were down just 0.2% by 1 p.m. in Tokyo, with oil up 1.4%.
Wednesday’s action paralleled market moves on Friday and Monday. Investors dumped risk assets and flocked to havens Friday after the U.S. killed a top Iranian military leader. Then those moves reversed on Monday, even amid warnings against retaliation.
Further volatility came on news of the crash of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 jet after take-off in Iran. U.S. stock futures slid and the yen rose, though those moves also faded after a report that the crash was due to a technical issue.
Key now is whether geopolitical risks can subside enough for attention to shift back toward the economic outlook. The U.S.-Iran tensions are developing against a backdrop of an improving picture for global trade, with a Sino-American trade deal expected to be signed next week. Manufacturing meantime remains weak, while job markets are solid across major economies.
“Though we’ll see the market react to the latest strike today, we don’t see that as a long-term risk-off theme,” said Chen Haoyang, a managing director at Shanghai Leader Capital Co. “We are and have been long on gold for the past year as we have been taking a cautious view towards the global economy, with the debt cycle nearing its end. Because we already have so much exposure we are not adding more with these new developments.”

694,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 11:08PM ET</span>",Samsung Electronics says profit fall likely milder than forecasts as chip prices bottom out,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) on Wednesday said quarterly operating profit likely fell at a milder pace than analysts forecast, indicating memory chip prices bottomed out and strengthening hope of recovery from an industry downturn.
The announcement sent Samsung's share price up 2.2% in morning trade, bucking the wider market's (KS11) 0.8% fall, with cross-town chip rival  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660) also up over 5%.
Samsung, the world's biggest maker of memory chips, has seen earnings drop since late 2018 as a weak global economy curbed spending by data center customers while rising inventories squeezed prices, ending a two-year industry boom.
But expected easing in the Sino-U.S. trade war is lifting optimism for a return of demand this year from server customers and makers of fifth-generation (5G) network-ready smartphones. Last month, Samsung's U.S. chip rival Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) forecast the industry to recover in 2020.
""The DRAM chip price has already hit bottom while inventories have been holding at lower levels - a potentially encouraging sign to pull up DRAM prices in the second quarter,"" said analyst Park Sung-soon at Cape Investment & Securities.
Samsung said it expected to report later this month a 34% drop in operating profit at 7.1 trillion won ($6.04 billion) for its fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 versus the same period a year earlier.
That would beat the forecast 6.5 trillion won operating profit from Refinitiv SmartEstimate, helped by one-off gains, analysts said.
Its revenue declined 0.5% to 59 trillion won, missing the 60.7 trillion won forecast from Refinitiv SmartEstimate.
Annual operating profit likely fell 53% to 27.7 trillion won, the lowest since 2015 and steepest decline in a decade.

MOBILE BOOST
Earnings from chips and mobile devices in the fourth quarter were better than analysts expected, whereas the display business lagged, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, declining to be identified as the information was not public.
""Samsung's Q4 mobile shipments rose from last year as sales in LATAM, South Asia and Europe were more robust,"" said analyst Tom Kang at market researcher Counterpoint. ""This was partially from Huawei's overseas losses and Samsung's new A series,"" he said, referring to Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd which is tackling restricted access to U.S. suppliers.
Premium smartphone sales also boosted earnings, Kang said.
Samsung is expected to announce a new version of its flagship Galaxy S smartphone and a foldable handset on Feb. 11.
In displays, Samsung - an Apple Inc (O:AAPL) supplier - shut a liquid-crystal display production line in September, hit by falling prices and slower demand for television sets and smartphones coupled with rising competition from Chinese rivals. Samsung plans to convert the line for more advanced displays.

Operating profit in the quarter ended Dec. 31 likely fell 34% to 7.1 trillion won ($6.09 billion) from 10.8 trillion won a year earlier, Samsung (KS:005930) said in an earnings guidance statement. That compared with a 6.5 trillion won profit expected by analysts.
Fourth-quarter revenue fell 0.5% to 59 trillion won, the statement noted.
Samsung’s shares on the KOSPI gained 2.9% to KRW 57,400 following the announcement.
The memory chip maker and smartphone vendor is due to disclose more detailed earnings results, including its net profits and sector-by-sector business performance, later this month.

Haven assets pared gains.
The strike had sent S&P 500 Index futures as much as 1.7% lower, though moves eased after Iran said it had “concluded proportionate measures” and wasn’t seeking war. President Donald Trump said he’ll make a statement Wednesday morning. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields came off their session lows and yen erased gains.
Iran had fired several rockets at two joint U.S.-Iraqi bases early Wednesday morning in retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian military leader. Gold retraced much of its move higher along with oil, which at one point surged above $65 a barrel.
“Markets will likely remain nervous,” Mitul Kotecha, a strategist at TD Securities, said. “Much now depends on the U.S. reaction and whether there is further escalation.”
Caution is returning to markets after a bumper 2019 for a range of asset classes amid signs hostilities are moving on to the next stage following the airstrike that killed General Qassem Soleimani last week. Investors have been left scrambling to reassess the risks posed by the U.S.-Iran conflict.
Meantime, investors continue to weigh developments on the trade front with the first phase of the U.S.-China trade deal expected by many to be signed on Jan. 15.

The move was Iran’s first response to the killing of General Qassem Soleimani by a U.S. airstrike last week. It was not clear if there were any casualties or major damage from the attacks.
“We are aware of the reports of attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. “The president has been briefed and is monitoring the situation closely and consulting with his national security team.”

698,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 09:46PM ET</span>",Markets Rush to Reassess U.S.-Iran Risk After Downplaying Danger,"(Bloomberg) -- The financial-market turmoil seen on Friday in the wake of the escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions lasted all of one trading session. Come Wednesday, strategists are warning the impact of deteriorating Middle East security could be more lasting.
“The market didn’t price the chance of a major conflict high enough when the U.S. drone strike happened,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors in Newport Beach, California, referring to Friday’s U.S. killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. “Now it’s more clear the situation won’t de-escalate and fear is replacing hope in investors’ minds.”
Even after Iran warned it would retaliate, stocks and bond yields rose on Monday, and put in a muted trading session on Tuesday. When Iran followed through with an attack on two U.S. targets in Iraq, the market reaction paralleled last Friday’s moves. Oil, gold, the Japanese yen and U.S. Treasuries jumped. U.S. stock futures tumbled, along with equity benchmarks from Japan and South Korea to Australia.
Here are some comments from market participants in the wake of the Iranian strike Wednesday morning Asia time:
Markets Were Unprepared
“The key point is that the market was in no condition for bad news of any kind,” said Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at Leuthold Group. “The market was bound to react badly to anything less than the best news on the economy, trade war, and even geopolitical tensions.”
“We are positioned right in the middle of our normal 30-70% range for equities in our tactical funds. We do not plan to buy to any dip potentially created by this escalation. Rather, we’d be inclined to sell into a first quarter melt-up if one develops,” he said.
Take on Hedges
“We are doing much more hedging to cut the risks in our portfolio,” said Jackson Wong, asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd. “The main thing we’d do is to buy more derivatives related to some ETFs and indexes to hedge against further declines of the general market.”
“No doubt the stocks related to gold and oil will perform better in the short-term, but I’d be cautious to chase it since the bearish situation might change quickly and I’m not that worried yet,” he said.
Don’t Call a Level
“History cautions against picking levels for the yen in instances of sharply heightened geopolitical tension (other than to expect support in the 100 area on fears of Bank of Japan intervention),” said Ray Attrill, head of foreign-exchange strategy in Sydney at National Australia Bank Ltd.
Buying the yen against the Australian and New Zealand dollars is the preferred way to trade geopolitical developments, he said. Dollar-yen is “quite fairly valued here near 108,” but could test support around 107 “if the negative news flow intensifies,” he said.
Trumping Trade War
“Iran has replaced the trade war as the biggest risk to markets -- 2020 has been hijacked by escalating Middle East tensions and investors will be re-positioning their portfolios to reflect this,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy in Sydney at AMP Capital. The yen could strengthen to 105 per dollar, but it would require “serious intensification” of the situation to test that level, he said.
Buy U.S. Stocks
“I would still be buying U.S. equities,” said Stefan Hofer, chief investment strategist at LGT Bank Asia. “I wouldn’t want to be too brave at this moment. But I mean, we think about the U.S. consumer, the labor market report will be out I think at the end of this week is probably going to be quite decent. Wage growth is strong, earnings are going to be improving into the first quarter.”
“If we can just set aside the whole political risk issue, ultimately on fundamentals the U.S. is the place to be,” Hofer said.
Wait and See
“I don’t expect to adjust my positions” in Chinese stocks, said Raymond Chen, a portfolio manager with Keywise Capital Management (HK) Ltd. “It’s a short-term event amid an economic-recovery trend,” though “it’s possible that there may be misjudgment from both sides” he said, referring to the U.S. and Iran. “I’ll wait and see how things pan out first.”
Yields to Slide
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields could slide as far as 1.6% in coming weeks or months thanks to further conflict in the Middle East, said Kyle Rodda, a market analyst at IG Markets Ltd. in Melbourne. The risk of outright warfare may still be relatively low, but the key for investors will be any attacks on energy-producing assets, he said. Canada’s dollar is likely to benefit, along with the Japanese yen, he said.
U.S. Reaction
“Much now depends on the U.S. reaction and whether there is further escalation,” said Mitul Kotecha, a senior emerging-markets strategist in Singapore at TD Securities. The missile attacks will likely support core bond markets, mainly U.S. Treasuries. Asian currencies will face some pressure, with the rupee among the more vulnerable thanks to India’s oil-import bill and the climb in energy prices, he said.
Other Incidents?
“The biggest risk to my overall take that this will end up being ‘a buy-the-dip and fade the risk-off wave’ will be if we got another geopolitical event on top of this,” said Kay Van-Petersen, a global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore. He flagged the potential for incidents involving North Korea or China and Taiwan."

In questions posted on a House website, Cicilline asked Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, about text messages he had sent to Dish Network Corp (O:DISH) Chairman Charlie Ergen, who plans to buy assets that T-Mobile and Sprint would sell as part of an agreement to win federal approval for their deal.
The planned merger of the third and fourth largest wireless providers is being challenged by state attorneys general, led by California and New York. A trial in New York is underway.
Cicilline noted that Delrahim wrote to Ergen: ""Today would be a good day to have your Senator friends contact the chairman,"" a reference to the chair of the Federal Communications Commission which has since approved the merger.
Cicilline asked Delrahim if he had offered lobbying advice to other merging companies and if it was appropriate to offer such advice.
Cicilline also pressed the antitrust chief on a report that the Trump administration has brought fewer criminal antitrust cases, essentially price-fixing, than any in 50 years. ""Is it your view that market participants are no longer engaging in price-fixing at the rates they previously had?"" Cicilline asked.
Cicilline asked Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joe Simons about the November approval of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (N:BMY) $74 billion purchase of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) on the condition it divest the drug Otezla.
Cicilline asked the agency whether its practice of focusing on product overlap is enough when analyzing this and other pharmaceutical mergers.
Cicilline also pressed Simons on the FTC's record $5 billion settlement with  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) for the social media company's violation of an earlier settlement with the agency. He cited criticism that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was not held responsible for the order violations.
""What is the Commission doing to ensure that CEOs of large companies are held accountable when their companies violate antitrust law with the CEOs' knowledge or at his or her direction?,"" Cicilline asked.
An FTC spokesman declined to comment. A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
700,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 07:28PM ET</span>","Boeing changes stance, recommends 737 MAX simulator training for pilots","By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Tuesday it was recommending that airline pilots undergo simulator training before they resume flying the 737 MAX, a shift from its previous position that pilots only needed computer-based training.
If U.S. and international regulators ultimately back Boeing's proposal, it could take airlines longer to prepare their crews to fly the 737 MAX jets that have been grounded since March after two crashes that killed 346 people.
Boeing has been working on revised pilot training and software updates for the 737 MAX to win regulatory approval for the jets to fly commercially again.
After repeated setbacks, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not expected to give the greenlight until at least February, perhaps March or later.
Last year, the planemaker said it would propose that MAX pilots did not need to train on costly simulators, a position it originally used to market the latest version of its 737 narrowbody workhorse against competition from European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
Airlines that bought the MAX have had to cancel flights while the global fleet remains grounded.
If only computer-based training were required for renewed 737 MAX commercial flying, Boeing's largest customer Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) had said it would take one to two months to prepare its more than 9,500 pilots on the updates.
Southwest had not been part of Boeing's recent discussions on pilot training recommendations and could not provide additional cost or timing estimates before there was specific guidance, spokeswoman Brandy King said.
Southwest has three MAX simulators in various stages of FAA certification and expects three more later this year.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) each have one MAX simulator.
Not many MAX simulators exist and it was unclear if training could be performed on the 737 NG simulator that 737 pilots have used until now. As of December, Toronto-based manufacturer  CAE  Inc (TO:CAE) had delivered 23 MAX full-flight simulators, a spokeswoman said.
The FAA said on Tuesday it will consider Boeing's recommendations during training evaluations of U.S. and international flight crew alongside regulators from Canada, Europe and Brazil.
Canada's Transport Minister Marc Garneau, who has leaned toward mandatory simulator training for Canadian 737 MAX operators, said in a statement that Boeing's signaling the importance of such training was ""encouraging.""
U.S. and European aviation safety regulators are meeting with Boeing this week in an effort to complete a 737 MAX software documentation audit - an important step toward the eventual return to service.
Boeing shares closed 1% higher on Tuesday following unconfirmed reports that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) is buying the company's stock. The stock fell sharply last month on the 737 MAX production halt.
Southwest and American are currently scheduling 737 MAX flights in April and United in June."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Elon Musk raised an online storm by dancing on stage at the launch of Tesla's (O:TSLA) Model Y electric sports utility vehicle program on Tuesday in its new Shanghai factory, where the company delivered its first cars built outside the United States to the public.
The $2 billion Tesla Inc factory started delivering cars in just 357 days, a record for global automakers in China. The first 10 customers from the public received their China-made Model 3 sedans on Tuesday.
Billionaire CEO Musk danced enthusiastically on stage at the event, then stripped off his jacket and flung it aside to reveal a T-shirt with a cartoon of the factory. In a tweet, he labeled the video ""NSFW"" - not safe for work.
He predicted that ""ultimately Tesla Model Y will have more demand than probably all the other cars of Tesla combined"", with his voice cracking with emotion at times while talking about the progress of the Shanghai factory. 
Musk's tweet of him dancing was viewed 2.5 million times and drew unflattering comparisons to famous Silicon Valley footage of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) chiefs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer dancing awkwardly at a 1990s Windows launch. 
""Admit it Elon, you did it for the memes,"" one user tweeted https://twitter.com/RenataKonkoly/status/1214544692949475328, along with a picture of Musk stripping off his jacket. ""I see you learned your dance moves at Dad school,"" said another. 
""Just tryin to grow my follower count on pornhub …,"" the billionaire, who has a history of being playful with his Twitter account, retorted.
The ceremony was attended by Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong and other senior government officials.
Tesla executives, however, did not provide further details on the progress of the China-made Model Y project. A Tesla representative declined to comment further.
Tesla's shares, which have jumped about 10% since the beginning of this year, are trading close to their record high after the company beat Wall Street estimates for vehicle deliveries in its fourth quarter. 
The positive news from the China factory have also caused a rally in shares of Tesla's Chinese suppliers. Shares of Tianjin Motor Dies Co Ltd (SZ:002510) have surged about 28% so far in 2020, while  VT Industrial  Technology Co Ltd (SZ:300707) is up nearly 6%. 
Construction of Tesla's first plant outside the United States began in January 2019 and production started in October.
The factory started with a production capacity of 150,000 Model 3 sedans and Tesla aims to push that to 250,000 vehicles a year, including Model Y, in the plant's first phase.
Tesla unveiled its Model Y in March 2019 and said in October that production of the electric compact SUV at its Fremont facility was running ahead of schedule, adding at the time that it expects to launch the model by summer 2020.
It has said that margin expectations are higher for Model Y than Model 3, while production costs are roughly the same.
Tesla's China website estimates the starting price for Model Y vehicles at 444,000 yuan ($63,911.56). It will announce the retail price later, the website says. The China-made Model 3 sedans are priced at 355,800 yuan before subsidies.

Shanghai Vice Mayor Wu Qing said he hoped to see Tesla extend its cooperation with the city and for the car maker to manufacture more models at its Chinese plant.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes declined on Tuesday as investor caution persisted amid a dispute between the United States and Iran, while energy shares fell as oil prices gave back some recent gains.
After the bell, S&P 500 futures fell 1% following reports that rockets were fired at an airbase in Iraq hosting U.S. forces. 
The late-day drop in S&P 500 futures suggests investors expect Wall Street to open at a loss on Wednesday.
During Tuesday's trading session,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) declined with oil prices, which had rallied in recent days on escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran following the killing of a top Iranian military commander by the United States last week.
Chipmakers gained and helped to limit market losses, especially in the Nasdaq. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) rose 1.8% with Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) gaining 8.8% after brokerage Cowen & Co upgraded the chipmaker to ""outperform.""
Equity investors have been jittery since late last week, when a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani, taking major indexes off record highs.
""We're trying to digest the Middle East action"" and other news on the political front, said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers' Multi-Asset Portfolio Solutions group in Boston.
""It's a little bit of a step back, take a breath, consolidate a little bit,"" he said. ""But we're going to start to head into earnings, and that's going to be the next catalyst for the market.""
Major U.S. companies begin reporting fourth-quarter results next week, with S&P 500 earnings forecast as of Tuesday to have declined 0.6% in the quarter from a year ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 119.7 points, or 0.42%, to 28,583.68, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 9.1 points, or 0.28%, to 3,237.18 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 2.88 points, or 0.03%, to 9,068.58.
Among gainers,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) shares climbed 1.1% after it said it was recommending that airline pilots undergo simulator training before they resume flying the 737 MAX, a shift from its previous position that pilots only needed computer-based training on new software following two fatal crashes.
Also,  Microchip Technology Inc  (O:MCHP) rose 6.7% after raising the midpoint of its third-quarter sales forecast.
 Apache Corp  (N:APA) soared 26.8% after it made a major oil discovery, with France's  Total  SA (PA:TOTF), off the coast of Suriname.
On the economic front, data showed new orders for U.S.-made goods fell in November, pulled down by steep declines in demand for machinery and transportation equipment.
However, a reading on non-manufacturing sector activity for November came in better than expected.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 94 new highs and 16 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.89 billion shares, compared with the 6.94 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

With fears fading that Iran would choose to engage in all-out war with the U.S., and risk detablizing oil supplies in the Middle East, traders reined in their bullish bets on oil.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto Dominion Bank (TO:TD) and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TO:CM) chief executives declined to rule out restructuring charges on Tuesday as Canadian banks turn to controlling costs to drive earnings growth in what is expected to be a tough year.
Royal Bank of Canada's (TO:RY) chief executive, meanwhile, said its focus will be on eliminating unproductive activities rather than employees, while Bank of Montreal's CEO (TO:BMO) acknowledged ""restructure fatigue"" after the lender's repeated one-off charges over several reporting periods.
The executives spoke at  RBC  Capital Markets' Canadian Bank CEO conference, which was webcast and monitored by Reuters.
Following a year in which most banks posted disappointing earnings growth on higher loan-loss provisions, subdued margin expansion and weak investment banking performance, analysts expect risks to outweigh opportunities in 2020.
Most banks have said they expect earnings growth of 3-4% in 2020, similar to last year, versus their medium-term growth targets of double that rate.
TD CEO Bharat Masrani said restructuring is necessary to adapt to industry changes.
""In the phase we're in, you should expect that this becomes more regular until... the level of innovation slows down dramatically,"" he said. ""Jobs within TD are changing quite dramatically... That requires us to restructure certain parts of our bank.""
TD Bank and Royal Bank took restructuring charges of C$154 million and $83 million respectively in the fourth quarter.
BMO took a C$484 million ($372.16 million) pre-tax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter as part of its push to reduce its workforce by 5%, or about 2,300 employees, following a C$120 million charge earlier in the year and a C$260 million charge in 2018.
""We don't intend to pull this lever again,"" BMO CEO Darryl White said. ""We have to make sure that 5% of the work goes away... we're doing that through technology, through rewiring the organization... and it's completely different from anything we've done in the past.""
Following the banks' fourth-quarter earnings in December,  CIBC  analyst Robert Sedran said in a note that the pressure on expenses will not abate and forecast more such charges in the quarters ahead.
Most of the banks said they expect adjusted expense growth to fall to 2-3% in 2020, from about 5% in 2019.
A restructuring charge ""is always a possibility,"" said CIBC CEO Victor Dodig. ""If there is an opportunity to take a charge that makes sense, that we can clearly communicate to our investors, we may consider that.""
The Canadian banks index closed 0.2% lower on Tuesday, compared with a 0.4% gain in the Toronto stocks benchmark (GSPTSE)."

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) on Tuesday added an oat milk beverage to its menu, as the coffee chain taps into the growing demand for vegan alternatives to dairy.
The new beverage is available at 1,300 locations in the U.S. Midwest, the Seattle-based company said.
It also launched new beverages made with coconut and almond milk in the United States and Canada. It has previously sold menu items made with those milks.
Plant-based milks' popularity comes as more consumers shun cow's milk, citing health and environmental reasons. Dairy sales have fallen for the past four years, and some of the largest U.S. dairy producers have filed for bankruptcy.
The alternative milk category stands at $1.8 billion, with sales of oat milk jumping over sevenfold to $53 million over the past year. Cow's milk sales came in at $12 billion for 52 weeks ending Oct. 26, according to Nielsen's data, down from $15 billion in 2015.
Market research firm Mintel projects sales of nondairy milks to reach $3.1 billion by 2023.
Sweden-based Oatly, which supplies oat milk to Starbucks in the Midwest, started production in the United States about three years ago and has partnered with several cafes in the country, including New York-based bubble tea café Boba Guys and Chicago-based Intelligentsia.
The trend mirrors the popularity of plant-based meat substitutes, with Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and Impossible Foods adding their vegan patties and sausages to menus at fast-food and fine-dining restaurants.
Starbucks has sold lattes and coffees with oat milk in Europe since 2018 and at a few of its upscale Reserve locations in the United States since last year."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) investment banker pleaded guilty on Tuesday to insider trading, as part of what U.S. prosecutors have called a wide-ranging international trading ring to generate tens of millions of dollars of illegal profits.
Bryan Cohen, 33, who had been a vice president in Goldman's consumer retail industry group before his Oct. 18 arrest, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud before U.S. Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman in Manhattan.
He is the first defendant to plead guilty among six charged last October in four separate indictments, including New York businessman Telemaque Lavidas, whose trial began on Monday in Manhattan.
A related 38-count indictment against a Geneva, Switzerland-based trader, Marc Demane Debih, was made public on Monday. His lawyer could not immediately be identified
Prosecutors said Cohen, who worked for Goldman in London and New York, gave a securities trader in Switzerland tips about corporate acquisitions in exchange for cash and other benefits from 2015 to 2017.
They said he tried to conceal his tracks by communicating through prepaid ""burner"" cellphones, and receiving cash in person and through intermediaries.
Cohen faces up to five years in prison when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan.
In a joint statement, his lawyers Benjamin Brafman and Joshua Kirshner said Cohen has accepted responsibility, and they hoped to show Pauley that Cohen is ""a fundamentally decent young man who should be sentenced in a relatively lenient fashion.""
Goldman spokeswoman Nicole Sharp declined to comment on the plea, but said the bank terminated Cohen's employment last year after his arrest. The bank was not accused of wrongdoing.
Prosecutors said Lavidas, the son of an Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc board member, passed inside information about the biotechnology company to Greek businessman Georgios Nikas, who made millions of dollars on the tips and passed them to another trader.
Other defendants included Benjamin Taylor and Darina Windsor, who prosecutors said were respectively investment bankers at Moelis & Co and Centerview Partners LLC and nicknamed each other as Pops and Popsy, and trader Joseph El-Khouri.
Nikas, Taylor and Windsor live abroad and have been at large. The United States has sought El-Khouri's extradition from London following his Oct. 21 arrest there.
At least three onetime Goldman employees have been charged in insider trading schemes since May 2018."

The airline has been struggling amid corporate turmoil - last year United Airlines ousted its chairman and controlling shareholder, revamping leadership.
Avianca will now buy 88 A320neo planes from Airbus, instead of 108, and delay their entrance to its fleet until between 2025 and 2029, instead of between this year and 2024, it said in a statement filed to Colombia's financial regulator.
The airline has also reached an ""agreement of mutual benefit"" with Boeing (N:BA) in relation to a pending order for two 787-9 planes originally meant to join its fleet in 2021, it said, without providing further details.
From 2023, Avianca will sign rental contracts with BOC Aviation to rent 12 A320neo planes for 12 years, the statement added.
Avianca did not say how much money it might save because of the changes, but chief financial officer Adrian Neuhauser said in the statement the effort had contributed to the company being in a ""solid position"" as it advances with its plans."
712,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 02:06PM ET</span>",Bond ETFs Come of Age After $150 Billion Year Heralds New Order,"(Bloomberg) -- Welcome to the big time, bond ETFs.
Long overlooked as the younger sibling of equity exchange-traded funds, strategies focused on corporate or government debt took in more than $150 billion in the U.S. last year, the most on record and just shy of the sum netted by their stock counterparts. It was the biggest annual leap for bond ETFs since 2014, boosting assets to more than $800 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.
While the fixed-income world is inherently conservative, the ease and low cost of ETFs is rapidly wooing converts. Worries that stocks have reached their peak, continued uncertainty over the direction of U.S. interest rates and rampant geopolitical risks have bolstered demand -- especially as traders find more and more innovative ways to strategically use these products.
“Investors are seeing the efficiencies that can be found using the ETF vehicle,” said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed-income strategy at WisdomTree Investments Inc. In finance, “typically you see equity folks take the lead and bond guys follow, and that’s continued.”
Liquidity concerns that have plagued the sector since its inception seem to be fading. While anxiety about a potential mismatch between the liquidity of a fund and its underlying securities hasn’t disappeared, bond ETFs seem to be inspiring more confidence as time goes on and they endure market fluctuations.
Fixed-income funds currently make up about 20% of the $4.4 trillion U.S. ETF market, but a BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). report from June suggests assets could explode to more than $2 trillion globally over the next few years.
In Europe, bond ETFs attracted more money than stock funds for the first time in three years in 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. Flows into debt ETFs almost doubled in Australia, and Taiwan’s ETF market surged thanks to interest from life insurers.
“There’s a huge wave of wealth retiring, and bonds are traditionally the safe-haven asset that preserves wealth,” said Will McGough, chief investment officer of retirement strategies at Stadion Money Management.
Overbought Stocks
By contrast, even with the S&P 500 Index continuing to beat records, many are wondering how long the bull market in U.S. equities -- now entering its 11th year -- can last.
Technical indicators suggest stocks have been overbought for much of the past three weeks, while an RBC Capital Markets survey of institutional investors in December found the fewest people describing themselves as “bearish” since the third quarter of 2018, just before the S&P’s 19.8% rout.
In addition, the onslaught of diverging headlines about U.S. and China trade talks and Brexit negotiations have given investors whiplash, while growing tensions with Iran may reignite a search for havens. Throw in mixed economic data from countries around the world and it’s little wonder that bonds remain attractive to many.
“There’s increasingly concerns we’re in late cycle,” said David Perlman, ETF strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. “If we are, fixed income can help to buffer some of the risk of equities.”
Nifty Uses
But these traditional allocations could be just the tip of the iceberg. Adding to the popularity of fixed-income ETFs is a spurt of creativity in how they can be used.
Banks are employing bond ETFs to facilitate portfolio trades that allow investors to seamlessly move large numbers of bonds on and off their balance sheets. Other users are relying on fixed-income ETFs as a hedge, to earn returns on money they’re waiting to allocate elsewhere, or as a tool to adjust their portfolios.
It helps that the fee-compression wave sweeping the ETF industry has made fixed-income strategies cheaper than ever. For instance, BlackRock,  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG’s DWS Group all slashed the costs of their high-yield debt funds in 2019. That trend is likely to spread in 2020, further bolstering ETF demand.
“Transaction costs in fixed-income bonds can be sizable, but in ETFs, they’re relatively low,” said Matt Bartolini, managing director at State Street Global Advisors. “As we continue to have these risk events and the structures continue to be tested, that’s just going to lead to more people becoming more comfortable with the structure.”"

Boeing (NYSE:BA) will soon inform airlines it will recommend pilots undergo simulator training for the 737 Max, which has been grounded since March after two deadly crashes. The FAA is already aware of Boeing’s decision.
The company designed the 737 Max in part to avoid simulator training, The New York Times reported, and the move is another setback for the company in the saga of the plane’s problems that cost the CEO his job recently.
Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) remained in positive territory, rising 1.2%, but were well off the highs of the day. The stock had been bid up earlier on market chatter about possible activist investor interest, Briefing.com reported.

The warning follows last year's admission by Lloyd's of London of sexual harassment and daytime drinking in the market, which employs nearly 50,000 people. Lloyd's has introduced a plan to raise standards.
""A senior manager's failure to take reasonable steps to address non-financial misconduct could lead us to determine that they are not fit and proper,"" Jonathan Davidson, the Financial Conduct Authority's Executive Director of Supervision, Retail and Authorisations said in a letter on Monday.
Senior manager approval is based on a number of factors including integrity and reputation, the FCA said in the letter to chief executives, which was also posted on its website.
""Although work has been undertaken in the market to tackle the issue of non-financial misconduct, it continues to be prevalent and will be a key focus for our supervision of firms and of senior managers,"" Davidson said.
Firms should share the letter with senior executives and boards, and ""act promptly"" to address shortcomings, he added.
The FCA did not name the companies it had written to.
Other insurers are also taking steps to improve conduct after the Lloyd's case. AXA UK (PA:AXAF) this week said it has started management training for brokers, including advice on preventing and tackling bullying and sexual harassment."
715,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 01:28PM ET</span>","U.S., European regulators to meet with Boeing this week on 737 MAX software audit","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - U.S. and European aviation safety regulators will meet with Boeing (NYSE:BA) this week in an effort to complete a 737 MAX software documentation audit - a key step toward the grounded plane's eventual return to service.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) both confirmed on Tuesday that they will meet in the Seattle-area with Boeing before heading to a Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in an effort to complete the audit.
Documentation requirements are central to certification for increasingly complex aircraft software, and can become a source of delays. In 2008, EASA nearly derailed Europe's Airbus A400M military transporter over software documentation following a failed audit.
In early November, EASA and FAA met with Boeing at the Rockwell Collins facility in Cedar Rapids and did not approve the audit. Instead, they sought revisions to the documentation of the 737 MAX software fix and flagged a number of issues, Reuters reported.
In mid-January, Boeing will halt production on the best-selling plane, which has been grounded since March following two crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people in five months. Boeing said on Monday it was reassigning 3,000 employees to other jobs as a result of the temporary halt.
Reuters has reported previously that the FAA is unlikely to approve the plane until at least February and perhaps until March or later.
Boeing said in November that regulators had requested the ""information be conveyed in a different form, and the documentation is being revised accordingly.""
Boeing did not immediately comment on Tuesday.
In September, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said the agency had told Boeing it is ""better to be very methodical and very detailed rather than try to rush a partially completed product and then say, 'We'll get back to you with the rest of it.'""
Aviation software audits frequently uncover inconsistencies or omissions in documentation but rarely lead to changes in the underlying software or system, according to an industry official."

Cowen upgraded its rating on Micron (NASDAQ:MU) to outperform from market perform and lifted its price target on the stock to $70 from $50. Micron shares surged 7%.
In its fiscal fourth-quarter, Micron reported a 35% plunge in revenue year on- ear as a glut in the supply of random-access memory (DRAM) chips pressured prices, keeping a lid on the chipmaker's growth.
But the woes in the memory market may clear up sooner than many expect, placing the chipmaker in pole position to leverage its improved cost position relative to its peers, Cowen said.
Expectations that memory price declines are bottoming out are not without merit.
TrendForce's DRAMeXchange research division, which tracks movements observed in the DRAM market, said last month that ""DRAM spot prices have begun to rebound,"" and touted a rally in contract prices as early as the first quarter.
But in its most recent quarterly update Micron continued to suggest that the glut in supply would continue. It forecast DRAM supply growth to come in slightly above the industry, while NAND supply growth was expected ""meaningfully below"" industry supply growth.
The company was not the only chipmaker that received the thumbs up from Cowen. 
With its quarterly earnings due Jan. 23,   Western Digital   (NASDAQ:WDC) has the opportunity to deliver better-than-expected earnings and raise guidance, citing improved NAND pricing, enterprise solid state drive market gains and improving hard drive margins, Cowen said, as it upgraded shares of Western Digital to outperform from market perform."

720,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 12:56PM ET</span>",Wall Street Is Gaming Out All the Possible U.S.-Iran Scenarios,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors and analysts returning to work this week after the festive break found an unwanted item on their desks: a geopolitical puzzle with a bevy of players, complex rules and no clear solution. They’ve spent every minute since trying to figure it out.
As the market turmoil sparked by the U.S. killing of an Iranian military leader eases, Wall Street is mapping out scenarios that range from retaliation by Tehran through proxies to tit-for-tat escalations.
The threat appeared to intensify Tuesday after Iran said it is evaluating 13 possible ways to inflict a “historic nightmare” on America, while dozens were killed in a stampede at the general’s funeral.
“The market is underestimating the risk,” said Fabrizio Fiorini, the chief investment officer at Pramerica Sgr Spa in Milan. “Investors are forgetting that equity is discounting a perfect alignment of planets in terms of monetary and fiscal stimulus and economic rebound and political stability. What happened in Iraq is suggesting that the planets are not aligned.”
Here’s a look at some of the scenarios money managers and strategists are considering, in their own words:
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)
Base case: Iranian retaliation is likely; energy infrastructure in the region is particularly vulnerable.
Status quo: We prefer U.S. Treasuries to lower-yielding peers as portfolio ballast and like inflation-protected securities against inflation risks.
Escalation: We believe markets are underestimating political risks, especially in the Gulf, North Korea and in cyberspace.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management
Base case: Tensions are high and risk is elevated, but Iran and the U.S. have constraints that likely limit escalation.
Status quo: Possible near-term Iranian retaliation includes attacks against Israel using Hezbollah, proxy escalations in northern Iraq and cyberattacks. Iran could pursue a more aggressive strategy, but the regime remains mindful of U.S. military power. Meanwhile, election-year politics likely limit U.S. engagement.
Escalation: The primary threat to oil prices is an Iranian escalation that draws catastrophic U.S. reprisal. Middle East military escalation historically meant higher oil prices, but as we wrote in The New Economics of Oil, even a major escalation would likely drive prices for only a short time.
Nomura International
Base case: The more likely scenario involves a retaliation from Iran, but not enough to spark an outright war with the U.S.
Status quo: Even if we assign relatively a high probability (of around 80%) to the scenario of no severe escalation and maintain our view that the positive themes of U.S.-China trade, improving global data and a bottoming of the semiconductor down-cycle continue, the risk-reward of holding our current level of positive Asia risk has fallen from what it was a few weeks ago. Thus, we reduce some of our outright short USD/Asia FX positions.
Escalation: The risk that the situation in the Middle East could intensify is undeniable and, if this occurs, it could lead to a further rise in crude oil prices and risk reduction. The sensitivity of major currencies to crude oil prices and global stock prices since October 2019 indicates that JPY appreciation is likely to become evident when crude oil prices rise during risk-off periods. Thus, in the short term, JPY long positions are effective as a hedge against the worsening situation in the Middle East.
Rabobank
Base case: A nervous waiting game is likely to continue as investors brace themselves for Iran’s retaliation. It is worth noting that gold is trading only modestly below the recent high and USD/JPY is struggling to gain a better upside traction following its recent fall.
Status quo: An indication that geopolitical risk remains elevated is Brent crude holding well above the pre-Iran crisis level. The sharp spike in oil does not bode well for energy importers. In the CEEMEA space Turkey and South Africa are particularly vulnerable as domestic factors are a major source of risk as well.
Escalation: Geopolitical tensions may escalate substantially in the coming days as Iran is reportedly assessing 13 scenarios to revenge the killing of Qassem Soleimani.
TD Securities
Base case: The reality is nobody can say with any confidence how the U.S.-Iran tensions will evolve. As such, the TD securities team would be keeping an open mind to changing the crude oil view should tensions escalate into 2020.
Status quo: For now, the recent oil spike is being faded as we take at face value Iran’s “promise” to stick to military targets and keep any retaliation proportional.
Escalation: The risk of increasing geopolitical tensions and a potential negative supply shock originating from the oil market could well mean that gold can move north of $1,600 should tensions escalate further, which also would help to send the rest of the precious metals complex to new multi-year highs."

""Luca de Meo, Chief Executive of Seat S.A. has had his duties as chief executive of Seat revoked at his own request and by mutual agreement,"" Volkswagen said in a statement on Tuesday.
De Meo is a contender for the top job at Renault, but a stringent non-compete clause in De Meo's contract is proving to be a hurdle in discussions about a move to Paris, one source close to the matter told Reuters.

""Luca de Meo leaves Seat, but remains at VW,"" a third source close to the discussions said.
De Meo's move comes as Renault tries to resolve management turmoil triggered by the arrest of former Renault-Nissan alliance boss Carlos Ghosn in Japan a year ago on financial misconduct charges which he denies.
Ghosn fled Japan last week to Lebanon and has said he will hold a news conference on Wednesday to give his side of the story following his arrest in late 2018.

Keytruda has been approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer, which accounts for around 85% of lung cancer cases, and currently holds a dominant position in that market.
Small-cell lung cancer accounts for about 10% to 15% of all cases of lung cancer, Merck said. It said the five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed in the U.S. with any stage of SCLC is estimated to be 6%.

Companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) are expected to report a 2.5% rise in earnings per share, which would be the best quarterly performance for the region since Q3 2018, according to the latest data from I/B/E/S Refinitiv.
The anticipated growth rate has however come down in recent weeks, shrinking from a high of 5.5% in early November.

Take oil, which behaved “relatively well” after a U.S. airstrike killed a top Iranian general last week, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG derivatives strategist Mandy Xu. WTI crude’s one-month implied volatility rose just two points to 26.5%, its bottom quartile over the past year, she wrote in a note on Monday.
That compares with a 14-point jump to 46% in September, when drones attacked Saudi Arabian oil fields.
But there was a big move elsewhere: the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) LP. USO saw one-month bullish options rapidly become more expensive versus bearish ones. To take advantage, Xu recommends buying the USO February $14/$15 call spread given escalating geopolitical tensions. The exchange-traded fund closed at $13.16 Monday.
On the surface, U.S. stocks took the friction more or less in stride. The S&P 500 Index fell 0.7% on Friday, only to claw back 0.4% in the next session. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, also climbed on Friday but hasn’t closed above 15 for almost a month, remaining well below its lifetime average of about 19. Volatility traders appear to have been prepared for a setback in equities, helping keep VIX gains in check.
Read about prescient volatility markets tempering the sell-off in U.S. stocks.
But underneath, traders were busy bidding up the cost of protection in what Xu identifies as “significant dislocations.” S&P 500 skew, the price of bearish puts versus bullish calls, reached its highest level since February 2018.
With skew elevated but implied volatility modest, UBS Group AG strategist Stuart Kaiser recommends a stock replacement strategy -- using options for directional bets instead of owning shares outright -- to reduce risk, according to a Sunday note.
At the same time, not all volatility indicators are flashing bearish signals for stocks. Todd Salamone, senior vice president of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, notes that the VIX has been on a trend of lower highs since the middle of last year -- and the past week’s ceilings just above 16 are consistent with that.
“There is room for a VIX decline to the 12 area, that would likely be coincident with new highs, as equities continue to plow ahead despite a visible and obvious VIX floor in place for several months,” Salamone wrote. “Stay the short-term bullish course until this pattern is broken.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial regulators said on Tuesday they will transform their data crunching capabilities over the coming decade to spot problems in banks and markets earlier.
Banks and insurers must report a wide range of data, such as how much capital and cash they hold and exposures to risky instruments like derivatives.
Data collection has grown sharply since regulators failed to spot a global financial crisis in the making a decade ago.
The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published plans to obtain data more efficiently from banks, insurers and investment firms, and to analyze the data better to predict, monitor, and respond to issues.
""Recent developments in technology should allow us to improve how we collect data from firms, making reporting more timely, more effective and less burdensome for firms,"" said Sam Woods, deputy governor at the Bank of England.
The FCA said it wants to transform itself into a ""highly data-driven regulator"".
The BoE is setting itself a decade-long timeline for the ""substantial challenge"" of reforming data collection so that it could explore ""more radical changes"".
There would be no ""one-size-first-all"" solution, the BoE said in a nod to lawmakers who want less burdensome rules for smaller banks to encourage competition.
Consultants McKinsey estimated last year that regulatory reporting by UK banks cost them 2 billion to 4.5 billion pounds annually as they fill in mandatory forms that could each contain thousands of data points.
John Liver, a UK financial services partner at consultants EY, said automated collection could cut costs. ""The path to transformation will require considerable effort... but the potential rewards are very significant,"" he said.
The BoE set out ideas for reforming data collection in a discussion paper and will respond to feedback later in the year.
Changes could include more detailed common data inputs and modernizing how the BoE writes reporting instructions, such as by using computer code instead of everyday language.

Another solution could be to introduce a ‘pull model’ that would allow the BoE to query certain data held within firms and generate reports on demand, the BoE said.

The latest changes are part of a broader strategic overhaul under Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, who is looking to build a bigger consumer business to shield revenue from wild swings in financial markets that have pressured its trading arm.
The bank said it would report its future earnings, starting with the latest December quarter, under the newly named units - investment banking, global markets, asset management and consumer & wealth management.
Goldman renamed its institutional client services business as global markets, while investment management will now be called asset management. The bank is also doing away with its investing and lending unit, it said in a regulatory filing.
It added a new consumer and wealth management segment that includes management and other fees related to managing assets, providing investing and wealth advisory services. (https:// ""The new reporting structure appears more centered around its different client segments and should help drive increased accountability in how it executes on its relatively new strategy,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jason Goldberg said. ""The biggest changes appears to be the elimination of 'Investing & Lending', an area that investors viewed as a low multiple business. Those revenue sources were divided up across its new business units,"" he added. Earlier in November, Reuters reported the bank may move away from its earlier goal of finding $5 billion in fresh annual revenue by 2020 to focus on new targets including a broad efficiency ratio and profitability measures. 
Goldman is expected to unveil the new targets and metrics in January at its first-ever investor day on Jan. 29. It is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 15.

734,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 06:58AM ET</span>","A Saudi family feud, a decade-long debt saga and a court's $14 billion decision","By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's largest and longest debt saga, fueled by a feud that has split one of its richest families, could be nearing a resolution after a court approved about $14 billion in claims related to the collapse of two business empires a decade ago.
The Saudi court has accepted more than $7 billion in claims from creditors against the Algosaibi family's conglomerate AHAB, and about $6.5 billion against tycoon Maan al-Sanea and his company Saad Group, two court documents seen by Reuters showed.
The Algosaibis and Sanea - who married into the Algosaibi family - have been locked into a bitter dispute over who was to blame for the 2009 collapse of the companies.
Both sides deny wrongdoing, but the demise of the two companies nonetheless left dozens of local and international banks with billions of dollars of unpaid debt.
A court-driven end to the saga would not only offer some relief to those creditors, but more broadly would be an important sign to international investors, as the cases would be resolved under a new bankruptcy law introduced in 2018 as part of reforms aimed at making the kingdom more investor friendly.
The Dammam Commercial Court last week approved more than $7 billion of claims against AHAB (Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi and Bros.) out of nearly $12 billion in total claims listed, according to one of the documents seen by Reuters.
In December the court approved around $6.5 billion of claims against Sanea and Saad out of nearly $18 billion of listed claims, excluding those filed by the group's employees, according to a separate document.
Simon Charlton, chief restructuring officer at AHAB, confirmed the approval of the claims against the company.
""The trustee has requested the court for permission to form a creditors committee and we hope that we can get a committee formed quickly and then finalize a proposal with a target to get a creditor vote on a proposal that can be presented to the court for ratification within 90 days,"" he told Reuters.
A legal representative for Saad Group and Sanea did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Saudi government's media office also did not immediately respond.
The approved creditors' demands will now be included in restructuring proposals which the debtors and representatives of their respective lenders will submit to the court.
The court approved claims from over 70 financial institutions in the AHAB case, including Saudi and regional banks, and international lenders such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), HSBC and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), the document showed.
But it rejected two of four claims by The International Bank Corporation (TIBC), a Bahraini bank which has around $3 billion in claims against AHAB. The bank had raised money in international markets, transferring the funds to AHAB.
Some $1.8 billion worth of TIBC claims were approved out of the $3 billion, according to the court document.
A spokesman for the administrators of TIBC, whose default in 2009 was at the center of Saudi Arabia's financial meltdown that year, said they planned to appeal against the court's rejection of two of its claims ""as they represent claims that are no less worthy than the other two"".

735,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 06:44AM ET</span>",Facebook defies China headwinds with new ad sales push,"By Paresh Dave and Katie Paul
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) is setting up a new engineering team in Singapore to focus on its lucrative China advertising business, according to three people familiar with the effort, even as chief executive Mark Zuckerberg ramps up criticism of a country that blocks the social network.
The team at Facebook's Asia-Pacific headquarters is tasked with developing better ad-buying tools for Chinese customers who have to work around internet restrictions in China known as the ""great firewall,"" the sources said.
One of the people described it as Facebook's first significant attempt at developing regionally localized ads tools outside of its Silicon Valley headquarters, where China-related engineering work previously took place.
Facebook confirmed the creation of the new team, describing it as having an ""Asia-first"" mission and consisting of both product and ""business integrity"" sub-teams. Its existence has not previously been reported.
A spokeswoman said the team would serve ""Asia as well as our global advertisers.""
Facebook sells more than $5 billion a year worth of ad space to Chinese businesses and government agencies looking to promote their messages abroad, analysts estimate. That makes China Facebook's biggest country for revenue after the United States, which delivered $24.1 billion in advertising sales in 2018.
Zuckerberg once hoped Facebook could find a way to operate its social network in China, making a high-profile visit to the country in 2016 and vowing to learn Mandarin. Product managers went on ""knowledge-exchange"" trips to China, swapping expertise on app features and advertising tools with counterparts at companies like Tencent and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), one source said.
The company's China dreams were ultimately dashed by ever-more-restrictive Chinese government internet policies, compounded by political and business tensions associated with the U.S.-China trade war.
But Facebook remains eager to expand its China ad business, which boasts customers in industries including fashion, social media and gaming. With Beijing aware its businesses must operate beyond the ""great firewall"" to grow, Facebook is positioning itself as the conduit for them to reach global audiences.
""Facebook is committed to becoming the best marketing platform for Chinese companies going abroad,"" Facebook wrote in Chinese on local social network WeChat in November.
NEXT PHASE OF GROWTH
Bytedance, the parent company of social media sensation TikTok, used Facebook's advertising tools to do exactly that.
In late 2018, the company surged app-install ads on Facebook's ad network, becoming its biggest Chinese customer as it grew TikTok's footprint, a former Facebook employee said.
It cut back drastically in 2019, to nearly nothing, according to previously unreported data from research company Sensor Tower. One source said TikTok calculated it had reached most people likely to use the app, so it shifted to building an ads business to compete against Facebook's. Graphic: Bytedance slows ad blitz on Facebook png, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/FACEBOOK-CHINA/0H001QXRVB3F/eikon.png 
A TikTok spokesman confirmed the trend, saying the company ""significantly scaled back spending and refined its ad strategy, resulting in an increased return on investment and stickiness among new users.""
Now looking to smaller Chinese companies to grow sales, Facebook must ease access to its advertising tools and reassure customers worried about the political dynamics.
""Small advertisers are wary of advertising with Facebook because Facebook is banned in China,"" one of the people said, adding that second- and third-tier cities with smaller businesses are key targets for the next phase of growth. 
The new Singapore team was seeded in the spring with a handful of senior engineers who moved from Facebook's Silicon Valley headquarters, according to LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles and the people familiar with the move.
One source described the team as being in the ""tens"" of people, with Hao Xu, a nearly 9-year veteran of Facebook who previously worked in the Growth unit, managing the effort, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Facebook is betting proximity to regional competitors and sales staff will lead to better ads features, the person said. In addition to China, Facebook does significant business in Asian countries including Vietnam, India and Thailand that have various types of internet restrictions.
The company also wants its engineering outpost to spot emerging trends, having determined the world's most interesting consumer technologies are being built in Asia, largely in China, one of the people said.
TWO FACES ON CHINA
Even while courting Chinese advertisers, Zuckerberg took an increasingly confrontational approach with Beijing in 2019, coinciding with scrutiny of Chinese apps in Washington and new pressures over U.S. antitrust investigations into Facebook.
In March, he pledged not to build data centers in countries with ""a track record of violating human rights like privacy or freedom of expression."" By October, he specifically named China, saying ""we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there.""
He also drew indignation on Chinese social media after accusing TikTok, which has emerged as a major U.S. rival, of censoring political protest, a charge the startup denies.
But Facebook's China sales operations have forged ahead. 
In the last year Facebook has taken at least a dozen big Chinese clients on trips to India and the Middle East, and showed them data on local consumers to encourage them to market more in those regions rather than just in the United States, one of the people said.
Raggy Lau, who runs Chinese small ad agency STERRY that works with 30 startups, told Reuters he expects to increase spend on Facebook in 2020 as bigger clients vie for its users.
The new engineering team, meanwhile, will aim to ease access for Chinese advertisers and improve fraud detection systems, one of the people said.
Facebook requires people buying ads to have one of its signature social media profiles. Clients in China can access barred overseas sites like Facebook through virtual private networks (VPNs), which allow internet users to change their browsing location to a different country.
But some Chinese businesses are concerned about creating profiles in the face of censorship rules, so building a workaround that could eliminate the need for a VPN has emerged as a key priority.

Greg Paull, principal at advertising consultancy R3, said his Chinese clients use brand spokespeople and online shops differently than Western clients. Facebook could also develop e-commerce tools for Chinese advertisers to organize influencers and set up storefronts, he said.

The suspension of domestic LCD TV production comes after the company last year chopped its spending, replaced its long-time CEO and started a voluntary redundancy program.
""We will be wrapping up our LCD TV production in South Korea by end of this year and focusing on our LCD TV production in China,"" CEO Jeong Ho-young said at the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas.
In October, the South Korean Apple (O:AAPL) supplier said it planned to ""downsize"" two of its LCD TV panel production lines in South Korea and was looking into various options.
LCD TV businesses accounted for 32% of LG's revenue in the July to September period, down from 41% the previous quarter due to fewer shipments from its LCD TV panel plants.
LG Display operates two LCD TV production sites, one in South Korea and another in China.
The company suffered three consecutive quarterly losses between January and October last year, but Jeong said the panel maker is expecting to see ""further improvement"" in its performance in the second half of this year.
While terminating domestic LCD TV production, LG Display aims to shift its focus to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology. It expects the newer technology to account for 50% of revenue by 2021, up from about 30% in 2018.
""We plan to build systems to mass-produce OLED products in our Chinese factory by end of the first quarter this year,"" Jeong said.
He said the company was not planning to shift the LCD TV production lines marked for closure in South Korea into OLED panel production.
LG's cross-town rival Samsung Display, a unit of  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), said in October it had suspended one of its LCD production lines in South Korea.
It also announced a 13.1 trillion won ($11.25 billion) investment in facilities and research to upgrade a production line.

ACEA represents manufacturers of passenger cars, vans, trucks and buses with production sites in the European Union and provides benchmark data on vehicle registrations.
Ferrari's membership took effect on Jan. 1, following approval at the end of last year by the association's board of directors, which is made up of the chief executives of its member companies, ACEA said.
Ferrari did not comment.

Ferrari is controlled by Exor (MI:EXOR), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, which also controls FCA and industrial vehicle maker  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI), another ACEA member.

  Aston Martin   Lagonda Global Holdings (LON:AML) fell 17% after saying profit declined last year, increasing the urgency for the British sports-car maker to attract new capital to fund a turnaround.
Challenging conditions continued through the peak delivery period of December, the company said Tuesday, adding that full-year adjusted earnings were about 130 million pounds ($171 million) to 140 million pounds. The company reported 247 million pounds for 2018.
Aston has turned out to be a frustrating investment for shareholders who bought into the initial public offering in late 2018. The shares fell 57% in the course of 2019, a year Chief Executive Officer Andy Palmer on Tuesday called “very disappointing.” By contrast, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) NV’s stock returned 70% last year, highlighting the diverging fortunes between the two super-car brands.
The company, best known as the ride of choice for onscreen spy James Bond, has been battered by an industry downturn, uncertainty around Brexit and a lukewarm response to some models. Weaker-than-expected sales have forced the carmaker to scale back its sales volume targets. While Aston Martin made progress reducing inventory, it remains “a bit higher than we’d like,” the CEO said in an interview.
Aston Martin has focused its efforts on the DBX sports-utility vehicle, which it unveiled late last year to break into a lucrative yet increasingly crowded market. The $189,000 DBX sits at the heart of plans to more than double annual output to 14,000 autos by 2023. Aston Martin said it got 1,800 orders for the model, meeting a condition it had to obtain a follow-on loan for $100 million.
“The DBX is the one bright spot,” Palmer said in the interview. “The order rate is much higher than we had expected.”
Aston Martin said it had to boost customer financing support and increase marketing, especially in the U.S., which undermined its cost-savings plan. The rally in the pound in December has also become an obstacle as it reduces the value of sales from abroad. The carmaker said higher sales of its entry-level Vantage model eroded average selling prices.
“The main question is not how many DBX have been ordered, but at what price and will it generate free cash or enough money to offset falling sales of Vantage/DB11,” said Sanjay Jha, an analyst at Panmure Gordon in an email.
The carmaker said it remains in talks with potential investors that were originally announced in December. That month, industry magazine Autocar reported that Canadian fashion billionaire Lawrence Stroll is planning a bid for the company.
Aston Martin expected its net debt to be between 875 million pounds and 885 million pounds at the end of 2019. In September, Aston raised $150 million of debt at double the cost of its existing bonds, with a further $100 million available if it achieved certain sales target for the DBX.
Aston Martin fell as much as 84 pence to 436.60 pence, cutting its market value to just above 1 billion pounds. It was the second-worst performing stock on the FTSE 350 index last year.

749,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 11:00PM ET</span>",Green Boom May Limit Japan Bond Sale Slowdown After Record,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s record corporate bond issuance is likely set to slow ahead, but a boom in environmentally-friendly debt could limit the downside.
Companies have sold 13 trillion yen ($120 billion) of bonds this fiscal year ending March 31, already the most ever with three months still remaining in the period, Bloomberg-compiled data show. That red-hot pace of issuance probably won’t be repeated in fiscal 2020 because borrowing costs may rise, while fewer notes will mature during the period, reducing corporate demand to sell bonds, according to underwriters.
The bond-sale frenzy has increased the cash Japan Inc. holds even more to a record 513.2 trillion yen. While the plentiful funding hasn’t translated to a major rise in capital spending, companies may be using the cash more to boost shareholder returns including stock buybacks, according to bankers. Rising interest in green notes may also help Japan catch up with other advanced economies in sales of the debt to finance environmental projects.
“There are many companies that are cautious about making big investments on capital, but it’s positive that they are diversifying their use of proceeds,” said Hisashi Kawada, executive director of debt capital markets at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo.
Japanese issuers including electronic component maker Nidec Corp., developer Tokyo Tatemono Co. and contractor Shimizu Corp. sold green notes last year, helping boost offerings to the equivalent of $6.6 billion, a record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That pushed Japan into the top 10 for green bond issuance for the first time.
Sales of the notes in Japan may double in 2020 as addressing climate change becomes a bigger topic, Kawada at Nomura said.
One type of environmentally-friendly bonds that may emerge in Japan this year is transition debt, according to Naoki Shindo, managing director and head of debt syndicate at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. Those securities help companies such as utilities finance projects aimed at switching to cleaner ways of doing business. Issuers in Europe have begun selling such debt.
“There are still companies which are engaged in brown businesses but we expect those firms to make a transition to greener business models,” Shindo said. He expects total Japanese corporate bond sales to be around 11 trillion to 12 trillion yen next fiscal year.
Enel’s Bonds
Shindo said that new debt types like Italian utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) SpA’s sustainability-linked bonds issued last year may start to take off in Japan as well. Interest costs for the notes are partly tied to the company’s success in hitting renewable-energy targets.
The primary market may also move to increase transparency in the bookbuilding process, with more issuers using the so-called pot system to sell bonds, underwriters say. The arrangement, prevalent in the U.S. and Europe, has syndicate banks share information among themselves and with issuers on bond buyers.
A record 15 Japanese issuers have used the pot system in bond sales this fiscal year, including Japan International Cooperation Agency, the first government-backed organization to sell notes that way, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has drawn huge interest from technology firms looking to shake up the city-state's banking landscape, attracting 21 applications for five digital bank licences on offer.
Among firms that have publicly said they are bidding are  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) affiliate Ant Financial, a joint venture between Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SI:STEL) and Southeast Asian ride-hailer Grab, and a consortium led by gaming firm Razer (HK:1337).
Singapore's banking liberalization is its biggest in two decades and follows similar moves in Hong Kong, which issued eight online banking licences last year.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said it received strong interest from a diverse group of applicants but didn't name them. Seven bidders are for retail banks and the rest are for wholesale banks.
""These include e-commerce firms, technology and telecommunications companies, FinTechs (such as crowd-funding platforms and payment services providers) and financial institutions,"" the MAS said on Tuesday. The majority of applications were consortiums.
The online-only banks are expected to operate at lower costs and offer services that differ from local incumbents such as DBS Group (SI:DBSM) and OCBC (SI:OCBC).
Firms have joined forces to combine banking and technology expertise and meet local licensing requirements, which are generally stricter than other markets such as Hong Kong. Retail bank licence holders, for example, will need S$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in paid-up capital. 
Some contenders hope deep customer data combined with new technology will help them win customers in Singapore, which has over 150 deposit-taking institutions and about $2 trillion in total assets under management.
""One of the key motivations for seeking a Singapore digital bank license is that it is easier to demonstrate a proven track record and regional connectivity to other regulators in ASEAN where digital banks are going to be available in coming time,"" said Varun Mittal, who heads the emerging markets fintech business at consultancy EY.
Singapore is issuing up to two retail and three wholesale bank licences.
Accredited retail digital banks will be able to accept deposits from and offer services to both retail and non-retail customers, although they must be headquartered in Singapore and controlled by Singaporeans. Wholesale banks will mostly serve small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and will not be subject to local control restrictions.
Singapore will announce the winners in June and digital banks are set to start operations in a phased manner from mid-2021.

American, the largest U.S. airline, said the compensation will be received over several years. The airline will use more than $30 million of the compensation for the airline's 2019 employee profit-sharing program.
American said it does not expect any material financial impact of the agreement to be realized in its fourth-quarter 2019 earnings and it will continue talks regarding compensation for damages related to the MAX grounding beyond 2019.
The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents American Airlines' 28,000 flight attendants, said it welcomed the news about compensation, and was evaluating the details.
Boeing said it does not comment on discussions with airlines.

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said Monday that it will reassign 3,000 workers to other jobs as it halts production of the grounded best-selling 737 MAX jet in mid-January.
The announcement came after  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Mexico's  Aeromexico  (MX:AEROMEX) disclosed they were the latest carriers to reach settlements with Boeing over losses resulting from the grounding of 737 MAX aircraft.
Neither airline disclosed the compensation. A number of airlines have struck confidential settlements with Boeing in recent weeks. Boeing said it does not comment on discussions with airlines. 
Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX has been grounded since March, following two fatal crashes in five months that killed 346 people.
In an email to employees, Boeing said about 3,000 employees, mostly in manufacturing, engineering and fabrication, will be reassigned to other tasks. Most of those employees work at Boeing's Renton, Washington plant where the 737 MAX is manufactured while some are at Boeing's South Carolina operations.
Some staff will be reassigned to work on the 767 and 777/777X aircraft in Everett, Washington. Boeing has said it does not plan to lay off or furlough any workers as a result of the production halt.
Boeing also said it added a MAX storage facility in Victorville, California. Some employees from Renton will staff MAX airplane storage locations in Moses Lake, Washington and Victorville.
Boeing's biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Inc (N:SPR), said Monday it would offer voluntary layoffs to some employees as it grapples with the production halt. The company said last month it would suspend production of 737 MAX parts beginning Jan. 1.
Reuters has reported the Federal Aviation Administration is not expected to approve the plane's return to service until at least February and potentially March or later.
U.S. airlines will not resume 737 MAX flights until at least early April, they have said.
Boeing and the FAA said Sunday they are reviewing a potentially serious wiring issue that could delay the return of the 737 MAX.
American said the compensation from Boeing will be received over several years, and of the total amount, more than $30 million will be used for the airline's 2019 employee profit-sharing program.
Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), the world's largest 737 MAX operator, said in December it had reached a confidential agreement with Boeing for a portion of a projected $830 million hit to operating income in 2019.
Boeing shares ended the day up 0.29% at $333.74.

Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods, which supplies plant-based Whopper patties to Burger King (TO:QSR) in the United States, said it would begin a limited trial of the Impossible Sausage in five regions including Springfield, Illinois, and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The imitation pork sausage will be sold in a toasted breakfast croissant, called the Impossible Croissan’wich, with egg and cheese.
""The number of people who are eating pork from pigs is humongous and the fraction of that market that is captured by plant-based products is tiny,"" Pat Brown, the chief executive of Impossible Foods, told Reuters in a recent interview.
Pork has been the world's most consumed meat for the past four decades, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Impossible Foods on Monday also announced another imitation ground pork product, but did not disclose details about where it would be produced or sold.
The company has been called out by analysts for selling only one type of plant-based meat since 2016, when it launched its burger.
Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat has used imitation pork, chicken and beef to create products for major fast-food chains including burgers for McDonald's (N:MCD), sausage patties for Dunkin Brands (O:DNKN) and chicken for Yum Brands Inc's (N:YUM) KFC chain.
Competition is heating up in the exploding plant-based meat market, with dozens of new products hitting grocery stores and restaurants this year. The global alternative meat market is forecast to be worth $140 billion in the next decade, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Entering China, the world's biggest consumer of pork, is Impossible Foods' biggest priority and the company is actively looking for partners there. Plant-based imitation pork is also likely to appeal to consumers elsewhere in Asia, where Impossible currently ships to over 450 restaurants."

""In 2019, our first full year of operation, Citron Capital, LP (""Fund"") generated a gross return of 56.4% and net return of 43.3%,"" Left wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.
While the fund bet that certain stocks would climb, Left also bet that certain ones would drop, writing ""the Fund's average exposure during 2019 was 75.8% long and 80.3% short.""
Left said that winners on the long side included Bausch Health (TO:BHC), RH (N:RH), and Snap (N:SNAP) and on the short side included  Ligand Pharmaceuticals  (O:LGND), Jumia Technologies , and Grand Canyon Education (O:LOPE).
After investing only his own wealth for roughly two decades,Left in 2018 began laying the groundwork for Citron Capital, his hedge fund. By raising outside capital, Left has more firepower to go after some of the biggest U.S. companies.
Citron has not disclosed the size of its hedge fund.
For this year, Left said RH, whose stock price closed at $212.77 on Monday, may be bought. ""We believe the company has matured to a point that we might see it acquired in 2020.""
He also said he is sticking by his bet that shares in Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) Interactive, whose stock closed at $29.75 on Monday, will fall. ""Citron put a one-year price target of $5 and we stand by it as $5 makes this still a $1.5 billion company.""
Neither RH nor Peloton responded immediately to emails seeking comment.
Left also gave investors lessons that he learned last year; reminding himself and others to stay away from what he calls ""big story 'cult stock'"" companies and sticking with what he does best: exposing fraud.
He also said that this year will be a year of growth and that he is looking to expand beyond his home base in Los Angeles."

The company is the latest retailer struggling in a market dominated by e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and other retail stalwarts like Walmart Inc (N:WMT) as more consumers shift to online shopping and look for the latest trends.
The retailer's shares, which were trading around $500 in 2013, plunged to about $5 late last year. They were down nearly 5% in extended trading. 
Pier 1 has drafted a bankruptcy proposal and made a presentation to creditors last month, with a plan to create a smaller post-bankruptcy company with about $900 million in annual sales, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The company also held discussions with lenders about potentially providing financing that would help the retailer continue operating while under bankruptcy protection, the person said. The retailer was not immediately available for a comment. 
The Fort Worth, Texas-based company said its third-quarter loss widened from year earlier as discounts on older merchandise put pressure on margins. Its quarterly comparable sales fell 11.4% due a late Thanksgiving holiday in 2019. (https:// To arrest mounting losses, Pier 1 now plans to close up to 450 stores, shut some distribution centers and reduce headcount. The company did not specify how many jobs would be cut. The retailer operated 942 stores in the United States and Canada, as of Nov. 30, 2019, according to its latest quarterly filing. ""Although decisions that impact our associates are never easy, reducing the number of our brick-and-mortar locations is a necessary business decision,"" Chief Executive Officer Robert Riesbeck said.  However, Moody's analyst Raya Sokolyanska said the company's latest plan will likely be insufficient to turn around the business in time to address its looming debt maturities, making restructuring or bankruptcy highly likely scenarios. The company was saddled with long-term debt of $258.3 million at the end of the third quarter.

The filing, dated Dec. 23, names as defendants the Mozambique state and Mozambique Asset Management, which took a $535 million loan from VTB as part of a costly project that U.S. authorities say was an elaborate front for a bribery and kickback scheme.
It says the case relates to ""general commercial contracts and arrangements"" but does not elaborate. It provides no further information other than that VTB Capital, the investment banking arm of VTB, is being represented by law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.
It does not state whether the case relates to the loan, which Mozambique and VTB had been trying to restructure. The deputy head of the legal department of VTB Capital said in October the loan represented a ""significant exposure"" it expected to be repaid.
VTB did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment, and a spokesman for Mozambique's Attorney General's Office did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment, outside of usual business hours.
The debt scandal has already sparked a series of court cases spanning London, New York and South Africa, ensnaring global investment bank  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), three of its former bankers, Mozambique's former finance minister and a past president's son.
However this is the first time any of the cases have involved VTB. Russia and Mozambique strengthened ties throughout 2019, with President Filipe Nyusi visiting the nation in August.
Credit Suisse and VTB provided or arranged a total of around $2 billion for the project, encompassing tuna fishing, maritime security and shipyard development. Hundreds of millions of dollars went missing, while the benefits never materialized.
Mozambique did not disclose some of the loans, which were guaranteed by the state. The International Monetary Fund and other donors cut off support when they came to light in 2016, triggering a currency collapse and sovereign debt default.
It remains on the hook for the money, the largest chunk of which now sits in a restructured eurobond. The country is trying to challenge the guarantee related to a $622 million loan from Credit Suisse, also in a London court."

764,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 04:27PM ET</span>","Qualcomm launches autonomous driving computer, aiming to hit roads by 2023","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) on Monday announced a computing system for autonomous vehicles designed to handle everything from lane controls to full self-driving that it aims to have on the road by 2023.
The system, dubbed Snapdragon Ride, is the company's first foray into a full system to power self-driving cars.
San Diego-based Qualcomm, known best as the world's biggest mobile phone chip supplier, has been a major automotive supplier for more than a decade, but primarily for the modem chips that connect vehicles to the internet and chips for the infotainment systems that power screens inside vehicles.
Qualcomm has spent years developing self-driving technology near its headquarters in virtual silence while rivals such as  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) jumped into the market, spending billions on acquisitions supplying major automakers for autonomous driving.
Patrick Little, the senior vice president and general manager of Qualcomm's automotive business, said the company is using the expertise it built in the mobile phone processor business developing powerful processors that consume little electricity and generate little heat.
Qualcomm's new computers can fit in one hand and do not need fans or liquid cooling systems to prevent them from overheating. Lower power consumption will become important in electric vehicles, in which computers will have to compete with the drive train for battery power.
""Many of these cars have a supercomputer in the back. It looks like your kid's gaming PC,"" Little told Reuters in an interview. ""Now imagine you're putting that in the trunk of an electric vehicle. Now your range anxiety is just doubled.""
Qualcomm has also broken the system into pieces of hardware and software that can be scaled up or down for various needs from automakers. A smaller version of the computer can be used for simpler tasks like lane-control, or the computers can be chained together for full self-driving. Little said Qualcomm has used test vehicles in San Diego to develop its own set of self-driving software algorithms if automakers want to use them, but that it will be up to each one.
""If they came to us with their own software stack, or even somebody else's software stack, we're happy to say we'll help you"" adapt it to Qualcomm's hardware, he said.

Qualcomm and General Motors Co (N:GM) on Monday also said that the automaker has expanded its existing partnership with the chip suppler into ""high performance compute platforms."" Qualcomm previously provided chips for the company's dashboard electronics, location tracking and driver-assistance systems.

Ford's figures rounded off U.S. automakers' sales for 2019, with passenger cars falling out of favor with buyers amid lower oil prices and as automakers focused on SUVs and pick-ups that are more profitable.
Total U.S. light-vehicle sales fell by about 1% from 2018, but still finished above 17 million vehicles for the fifth consecutive year.
Discounts during the key holiday season and lower interest rates helped pushed sales of Ford's trucks to 330,075 in the quarter, up from 284,859 trucks a year earlier.
However, passenger car sales at the company declined 41% to 63,400 cars. The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it sold 601,862 vehicles in the quarter, compared with 609,693 vehicles a year earlier. 
Shares of the company fell as much as 1.6%, while shares of No.1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) declined 1.4%.
Ford sold 896,526 full-size pickup trucks in 2019, outselling rival General Motors Co, which sold 802,962 pickups during the year.
Fellow automakers reported their quarterly sales numbers on Friday.

GM, which was hit by a month-long strike by its 48,000 hourly employees, reported a 6.3% fall in sales for the fourth quarter.

768,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 03:22PM ET</span>",Occidental to cut Western Midstream stake to reduce debt,"By Shariq Khan and Arunima Kumar
(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) said on Monday it would cut its majority stake in pipeline operator Western Midstream Partners LP (N:WES) to less than 50% in 2020, to reduce its debt that grew significantly with the Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) deal.
Occidental's shares rose about 4% on the news, having lost over 30% in value since the $38-billion offer for Anadarko was made public on April 24, 2019.
Occidental is working to pare $40 billion of debt it took on with the Anadarko deal, and changes to ownership would ease a sale or spin-off of Western Midstream.
The restructuring would also allow Occidental to no longer show the gas pipeline and processing business's debt as its own.
The net long-term debt for Occidental was $47.6 billion as of Sept. 31, 2019.
The deal, which has been called ""hugely overpriced"" by activist investor Carl Icahn, continues to weigh on Occidental's shares, which still trade at levels it touched during the financial downturn of 2008.
Inherited as part of the Anadarko takeover, the sale of the Western Midstream stake is a key part of Occidental's target to raise a total of $15 billion from asset sales by mid-2020.
Occidental has raised about $10.5 billion through sales of properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and oil production elsewhere in Africa.
Western Midstream currently trades at a market value of over $9 billion.
The restructuring of the Western Midstream agreements will put Occidental back on track to hive off the business, something it tried to do unsuccessfully last year.
""I don't view the plans to reduce its ownership level to below 50% in 2020 as surprising. It's likely just a first step towards monetizing more of its ownership position over time,"" said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.
Occidental on Sunday gave up over 9 million shares, or a 2% stake in Western Midstream's general partner, and allowed limited partners to remove Occidental and appoint a new general partner. Occidental fully owns the general partner stake, which effectively controls Western Midstream, a master limited partnership, and around 55% of the pipeline operator's limited partner units.
Western Midstream's limited partner units rose 3.6% to $21.54 on Monday."
769,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 03:13PM ET</span>","Byron Wien Predicts S&P 500 Will Top 3,500 as Fed Cuts Rates","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks will extend their record-setting rally in 2020 as subdued economic growth prompts the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, according to Byron Wien’s annual list of surprises.
The S&P 500 will climb above 3,500 at some point this year, Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group Inc.’s private wealth solutions business, wrote in a statement along with Chief Investment Strategist Joe Zidle. Economic growth will trail forecasts and the central bank will lower its benchmark rate to 1%, they predict. The equity gauge recently traded at 3,234 and Fed’s fund rate stood at 1.75% while economists tracked by Bloomberg expect U.S. gross domestic product to expand 1.8% this year.
“The economy disappoints the consensus forecast, but a recession is avoided,” they wrote. “S&P 500 multiples remain elevated because monetary policy is easy and investors become more comfortable that intermediate interest rates will rise slowly.”
Wien, 86, a former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist who’s put out his “surprises” list since 1986, is one of the most widely followed on Wall Street. A year ago, he predicted the S&P 500 would climb 15%, with the economy continuing to expand and the Federal Reserve refraining from raising interest rates. The benchmark index rallied 29% and the central bank cut rates three times.
Some of his forecasts for last year proved prescient, including a rally in Chinese shares and a flat U.S. dollar. His optimism for a U.S.-China trade deal to be reached in the first quarter, however, turned out to be misplaced. He also misjudged the chances for the U.K. to stay in the European Union and Theresa May to remain as prime minister.
For the coming year, Wien and Zidle predict that the U.S. and China will not reach a comprehensive phase two trade deal. To spur growth, President Donald Trump will cut payroll taxes, they say. While U.S. growth slows, foreign demand for Treasuries is expected to stay elevated as negative interest rates persist overseas. As a result, yields on 10-year Treasuries approaches 2.5% and the yield curve steeps, they forecast.
Wien says his surprise list is made up of events that investors assign 1-in-3 odds of happening but that he thinks are more than 50 percent likely. Below are the duo’s other calls for 2020:

HP rejected the $22 per share offer in November saying it ""significantly"" undervalued the company, following which the printer maker took the offer directly to HP's shareholders.
Xerox has engaged in ""constructive dialogue"" with many of HP's largest shareholders, the company's chief executive officer, John Visentin, said in a letter addressed to HP's board on Monday.
""My offer stands to meet with you in person, with or without your advisors, to begin negotiating this transaction,"" Visentin said.
Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a 4.2% stake in HP and a 10.9% stake in Xerox, in December urged HP shareholders who agreed with a merger with Xerox to reach out to the PC maker's directors for immediate action.
HP had said it was open to exploring a bid for Xerox, stating that it recognizes the potential benefits of consolidation.
Shares of HP were up nearly 2% in trading before the bell. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 02:43PM ET</span>",Four-day refinery strike in France should not leave motorists stranded: Total,"PARIS (Reuters) - French oil major  Total  (PA:TOTF) said on Monday that strikes against the government's pension reform were having no impact on its fuel supply and distribution ahead of a four-day nationwide strike in French oil refineries.
A day before unions are starting a 96-hour strike and protest actions at refineries in France, oil companies and the government are saying that motorists need not fear fuel shortages, but union leaders say they are determined to squeeze supplies until the government drops its pension reform plans. 
""Our gas stations are well stocked on Monday. The protest movement that has been announced will have no impact on the supply of our network from Jan. 7 to 10 and beyond,"" Total said in a statement. 
Total said that only 26 - or just 0.7% - of its 3,500 gas stations had supply problems on Monday morning and that there was no risk of shortages in its retail network. 
Hard-line CGT union official Thierry Defresne told Reuters that seven out of eight French refineries will be on strike for 96 hours from Tuesday to Friday. 
He said those refineries will close completely and will not distribute a single product, including no kerosene fuel for airplanes.
""There will be disturbances to fuel supply. Our goal is not to make motorists' lives miserable. We want to show that workers are united against this reform,"" Defresne said. 
About 50% of the fuel sold in France is not produced in local refineries but imported, which reduces the impact of French refinery strikes, an industry source said. 
Total said its four oil refineries in Donges, Feyzin, Normandie and Grandpuits as well as its bio-refinery at La Mède were in operation. 
It said that in Donges, Feyzin and Normandie products were shipped normally by trucks and pipeline, but that Grandpuits and La Mede could only be supplied by pipeline. 
Total also said that with the exception of two fuel storage facilities attached to Grandpuits and La Mède, no depots were blocked. Nationwide, France has some 200 depots from where fuel is distributed to gas stations. 
Public transport sector workers at national railway SNCF and Paris metro operator RATP have been on strike for more than a month, and on Thursday unions are organising a fourth day of nationwide protest marches against President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform plans.

(Reuters) - From making cars talk using Alexa's voice to managing data from factories full of robots, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) wants a big piece of the action in transportation, and this week at CES will unveil more about its strategy to achieve that goal than ever before.
The Seattle retail and cloud services powerhouse plans to use the annual technology show in Las Vegas to unveil its plan to be a major player in self-driving vehicle technology, connected cars, electric vehicles and management of the torrents of data generated by automakers and drivers, company executives told Reuters.
Amazon Web Services, which provides large-scale cloud computing and data management services, is central to Amazon's strategy. 
""We really are extending ourselves more and more out in the ecosystem from manufacturing to connected car,"" Jon Allen, head of professional services in Amazon Web Services' automotive practice, said in a telephone interview. ""The takeaway message on this is if you go to CES this year we really are taking it as a 'One Amazon' view.""
Until now, Amazon has shown its transportation strategy to investors - and rivals - one piece at a time. Amazon has invested in self-driving software startup Aurora. It also has signed deals with automakers to deliver packages to vehicle trunks, help develop electric vehicle charging networks and use AWS to network their factories.
The Seattle company will share the CES stage with partners such as virtual reality firm ZeroLight, electric vehicle startup Rivian, Canada's BlackBerry Ltd (TO:BB) and video game software development company Unity Technologies.
""It's our attempt to weave everything together in a single experience for our customers,"" Dean Phillips, AWS' automotive technical leader, told Reuters. ""Customers don't distinguish AWS from Alexa from Amazon.com. It's Amazon.""
At CES, ZeroLight and General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cadillac will demonstrate how they are partnering to develop an online vehicle configuration experience that will allow high-fidelity images of vehicles that consumers build online to be taken with them on visits to dealers, Phillips said. 
The process can open the door to dealers better meeting customer needs by knowing what users focused on when building their dream car. It has already boosted profit per vehicle at Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi brand by an estimated 1,200 euros ($1,340), he said.
Rivian, in which Amazon has twice invested, will demonstrate Alexa in the R1T electric pickup truck it will begin building this fall, as well as the companion R1S SUV that will follow, Phillips said. Rivian will begin building 100,000 electric delivery vans for Amazon starting in 2021. Alexa will be integrated into all of those vehicles, Amazon said. 
BlackBerry and Karma Automotive, using AWS back-end services, will demonstrate how to better predict an electric car's battery health, allowing automakers to train drivers on how to drive in ways that will extend the battery's lifetime, he said. 
Unity will show how its gaming simulations are used by automakers to create virtual worlds to allow self-driving vehicle developers to speed the training of the software used in those cars, Phillips said. 
Some industry officials fear the loss of profits to technology companies, but Amazon has worked to woo the sector by showing greater flexibility to company needs. For instance, when Alexa is launched in GM cars in the U.S. market next year, it will be push-button activated and not use the wake word, ""Alexa,"" Amazon officials said. 
A new in-car feature, using the voice command ""Alexa, pay for gas,"" will enable users to buy fuel at 11,500 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Mobil gas stations, Amazon said.
A new version of Fire TV will be available this year on in-vehicle entertainment systems from  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), Amazon said.

774,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 01:46PM ET</span>","HP had 'buyer's remorse' over ill-fated Autonomy deal, court hears","LONDON (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard suffered ""buyer's remorse"" over its disastrous $11 billion acquisition of Autonomy and was trying to pin the blame on UK entrepreneur Mike Lynch, London's High Court heard on Monday in the closing stages of a multi-billion dollar case.
U.S. software giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) is suing Autonomy founder Lynch along with his former finance chief Sushovan Hussain for more than $5 billion, alleging that they inflated the value of the British data firm before selling it.
Lynch and Hussain have denied the allegations.
HP bought Autonomy in 2011 but a year later it wrote down the value of the British company by $8.8 billion, saying it had uncovered serious accounting improprieties.
Lynch's lawyer Robert Miles told the court on Monday that HP's then-chairman Ray Lane had ""serious cold feet"" almost immediately after the deal was announced, and the company's board and management had never seriously tried to integrate Autonomy.
""This is a case study in buyer's remorse,"" he said.
""The board buckled to the pressure of the adverse movement in the share price and indeed we say lost their corporate nerve,"" he added.
HP has argued Lynch and Hussain were complicit in a plan to inflate the value of Autonomy through a series of fraudulent transactions, such as selling hardware at a loss and ""round-trip"" deals, a type of barter with no real commercial rationale.
The U.S. company, in its closing argument last month, said Lynch had invented evidence on the stand in order to distance himself from some of the alleged fraudulent transactions. Lynch had told ""lie after lie"", HP's counsel said.
Miles, however, said on Monday that there were two levels to the case: firstly whether there were any underlying problems with Autonomy's accounts; and secondly, if there were such problems, whether Lynch was complicit.
He said the allegation that Lynch knew that any of Autonomy's accounts were false was ""really far-fetched"", given that he was already rich and successful and he would continue to lead Autonomy after it was acquired, by which time HP would have full access to all of the accounts.
Closing arguments in the civil case will end this month, although further evidence could be heard in the coming months before Judge Robert Hildyard makes his judgement later in the year.
The United States last month formally requested the extradition of Lynch to face criminal charges including securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy over the 2011 HP deal.
Hussain has already been convicted on 16 counts of wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy in San Francisco over the deal, and he received a five-year prison term and a $4 million fine in May.
Hussain was granted bail in June while he appeals his conviction."
775,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 01:44PM ET</span>",U.S. Pays Bulk of Tariff Costs as Levies Fail to Save Steel Jobs,"(Bloomberg) -- American companies and consumers are paying almost the full cost of U.S. tariffs, and the impact of those duties on import volume magnifies over time, according to a paper circulated Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Traditional trade theory would suggest tariffs levied by the U.S. should cause foreign firms to lower prices and thereby force them to shoulder the cost of the duties. However, the study by Federal Reserve Bank of New York researcher Mary Amiti and professors Stephen Redding of Princeton and David Weinstein of Columbia shows the levies haven’t had a major impact on foreign export prices, suggesting American firms and consumers bear almost all the burden in most sectors as companies work to reorganize supply chains.
“Among goods that continue to be imported, a 10% tariff is associated with about a 10% drop in imports for the first three months, but this elasticity doubles in magnitude in subsequent months,” the authors wrote. That suggests “the 2018 tariffs - many of which were applied in October - are only now having their full impact on U.S. import volumes.”
A separate working paper circulated by NBER Monday showed the 2018-19 tariffs also damped U.S. exports.
While Americans bear the cost of tariffs in most sectors, the same doesn’t apply in the politically important steel industry, the study by Amiti, Redding and Weinstein showed.
President Donald Trump fulfilled a campaign promise when his administration put 25% duties on imported steel in March 2018. The decision, meant to protect the industry from dumping practices by countries like China, was widely praised by producers, several of which announced plans to boost output.
The paper finds the European Union and nations including South Korea and Japan are shouldering almost half the cost of U.S. steel tariffs. That’s good news for U.S. companies demanding the metal, “but bad news for workers hoping that steel tariffs will bring back jobs,” the paper said. It also may help explain why American steel production only increased by 2% per year between the third quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2019 despite the 25% steel tariffs, according to the authors.
The paper follows U.S. Steel Corp.’s December announcement that it would close its giant plant outside of Detroit and lay off as many as 1,545 workers. Following this, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the closure didn’t mean the import tariffs aren’t working.
The paper’s authors seem to disagree. “These results suggest that the steel tariffs have a much smaller capacity to protect steel workers than other tariffs,” they said."

777,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 01:03PM ET</span>",Iran-U.S. Tensions Stoke Fears of Spike in Gasoline Prices,"(Bloomberg) -- Escalating Iran-U.S. tensions raise the prospect of a spike in gasoline prices, though the effects so far have been minimal.
Gasoline prices have held steady in the U.S. following the Thursday killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iran’s threats of retaliation that could include attacks designed to disrupt the flow of crude oil. However, oil and gasoline prices could surge if hostilities escalate.
“So far, what we’ve seen in oil -- which is about a $1-per-barrel increase from a week ago -- is not too unsurprising,” Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at retail fuel price tracker GasBuddy, said by phone. “But more of the impact could be after Iran retaliates, which they’ve certainly all but promised to the U.S. at this point.”
Even so, motorists may see a “slight uptick” in gasoline prices over the next seven to 12 days, DeHaan predicted.
Auto club AAA reported a nationwide average of $2.58 per gallon on Monday. Gasoline futures also show little change, with the NYMEX RBOB contract for February delivery up just 0.38% at $1.75 per gallon.
Oil futures rose as much as 3.1% on Monday. Brent crude oil futures climbed to as high as $70.74 a barrel on ICE (NYSE:ICE) Futures Europe after a 3.6% surge Friday. West Texas Intermediate for February delivery climbed as much as 2.65% and were at $63.16 on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 12:21 p.m.
Ample domestic supply and slowing economic growth ensure any increase in oil prices isn’t expected to last long, said Jim Lucier, managing director of research firm Capital Alpha Partners.
A surge in U.S. crude oil production has helped insulate the country from supply disruptions overseas.
“Before the U.S. energy revolution took off, American consumers were generally vulnerable to price shocks due to instability in the Middle East,” said Dean Foreman, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute. “However, the rise of U.S. energy leadership has helped to reduce market volatility by about half since 2014. Consequently, recent geopolitical events have had relatively small effects on energy prices and provide a consistent reminder of how vital it is to have a strong domestic U.S. oil and natural gas industry.”"

783,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 10:08AM ET</span>","Fed-Cut Bets Firmed on Iran Tension, But Just One Easing Is Seen","(Bloomberg) -- Traders have firmed in their conviction that that the Federal Reserve will trim interest rates further as concern swirls around the deteriorating global geopolitical situation. But they’re far from pricing in the more dire economic scenarios seen several months ago.
Fed funds futures are now fully pricing in a quarter-point cut by the end of 2020. The probability of such a move was closer to 70% on Thursday. It then surged Friday in the wake of the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and upended the political situation in the Middle East. The tension also drove investors into longer-maturity Treasuries, flattening the U.S. yield curve.
Yet the level of concern the market moves are signaling remains modest relative to the second half of 2019. In early September, trade-war angst helped push expectations for where the Fed target rate might end 2020 below 0.9%. The expectation now is for it to be around 1.30%, a quarter-point below the current fed funds effective rate. The central bank lowered borrowing costs three straight times in 2019 before pausing last month.
“It’s a little premature” to price in further cuts based on geopolitics, said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). “The Fed pricing aligns more with economic fundamentals -- that could of course quickly change if we saw a further sell-off in risky assets.”

(Reuters) - Family offices, which handle the wealth of the very rich and their kin, are increasingly poaching young talent from buyout firms, challenging the private equity industry's claim as the destination of choice for aspiring dealmakers.
The five executive headhunting firms with the biggest market share on Wall Street - Korn Ferry, Egon Zehnder, Russell Reynolds Associates, Odgers Berndtson and Heidrick & Struggles - told Reuters they have seen a significant increase in the number of private equity professionals moving to family offices in the last five years.
Walton Enterprises LLC, Pritzker Private Capital and Soros Fund Management LLC are among the family offices competing with private equity giants such as Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) and KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) in the fight for talent, the headhunters say. 
A spokeswoman for Pritzker Private Capital confirmed it seeks to hire top talent from private equity firms. Walton Enterprises, Soros Fund Management, Blackstone and KKR declined to comment. 
Some money managers making the move to family offices say they are lured by the lucrative pay that is often offered and are seeking to escape the private equity industry's intense pace of sourcing transactions and fundraising.
""I wanted to do something more entrepreneurial. I had two very young children and I saw that the lifestyle of a private equity partner would not allow me to be as present in their lives as I wanted to be,"" said Sarah Overbay, who manages the investment portfolio of North Island, the family office of Glenn Hutchins, a co-founder of Silver Lake Partners. 
Overbay previously spent six years working at private equity firm Freeman Spogli & Co before joining Marron Capital, the family office of late financier Donald B. Marron, in 2011. ""Don offered me similar compensation to what I was making,"" she said.
Many family offices are investors in private equity funds. The competition for talent underscores family offices' growing ability to bypass buyout fund managers and allocate money directly to leveraged buyouts, avoiding the private equity industry's hefty fees. 
Family offices have been poaching private equity talent by tweaking their compensation plans. Just like private equity firms, they are offer investment professionals substantial ""carry economics"" - the performance fees tied to investment returns - in addition to salaries and bonuses.
The competition has been intensifying as the family office industry grew in assets under management from about $4 trillion in 2017 to $5.9 trillion this year, according to market research firm Campden Research.
""The growth (in family office recruitment) is two-fold: there's more wealthy families who can create investment firms, and a dissatisfaction with private equity firms,"" said Joe Healy, a partner and head of the private equity practice at Korn Ferry.
BUYOUT FIRMS SWEETEN TERMS
To be sure, the private equity industry continues to attract the bulk of aspiring dealmakers, given the relatively small size of family offices' investing teams, executive headhunters say. It also remains an attractive destination for many investment bankers and seasoned corporate executives. 
But even in instances where staff is not poached from buyout firms, the intensified competition for talent had raised the pressure on them to provide attractive employment terms and a desirable work-life balance, the headhunters said.
Base salaries and vacation time in the private equity industry have been rising, while staff bonuses and long-term incentives accounted for a greater percentage of overall compensation in 2019 than in prior years, according to the 2019 Private Equity & Venture Capital Compensation Report.

""Family offices understand that the cost of acquisition for this type of professional is high, but the return can be easily measured, and they may be more inclined to provide that type of incentive,"" said David Fox, president of Northern Trust's global family and private investment group, which oversees up to $92 billion in assets for single-family offices.

LONDON (Reuters) - Tensions in the Middle East after the United States killed an Iranian general erased new year's gains for world stocks on Monday as investors pushed safe-haven gold to a seven-year high and oil jumped to its highest since September.
The United States detected a heightened state of alert by Iran's missile forces, as President Donald Trump warned the U.S. would strike back, ""perhaps in a disproportionate manner"", if Iran attacked any American person or target.
Iraq's parliament on Sunday recommended all foreign troops be ordered out of the country after the U.S. drone attack killed the Iranian military commander and an Iraqi militia leader.
Spot gold  gained 1.8% to $1,579.72 per ounce to reach its highest since April 2013. Oil prices extended gains on fears any Middle East conflict could disrupt global supplies. Brent crude futures jumped past the $70 a barrel mark, while U.S. crude climbed 1.7% to $64.12.
European shares extended losses and were set for their worst day in a week, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 1% by midday in London. The European oil and gas stock index (SXEP) rose about 0.86%, the only gains, to reach its highest since July. 
""Geopolitical events by their nature are unpredictable, but previous periods of increased tensions suggest that the impact on wider markets tends to be short-lived, with more lasting effects confined to local markets,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""In general, this supports holding a diversified portfolio.""

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei (N225) slid almost 2%. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 fell 0.6%, indicating a lower open on Wall Street later.
Chinese shares, which had opened in the red, reversed their losses, as did Australian shares, which ended the day flat. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI) lost 0.8%.
Sovereign bonds benefited from the safety bid, with yields on 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) down at 1.7725% after falling 10 basis points on Friday.
The yen remained the favoured safe haven among currencies thanks to Japan's massive holdings of foreign assets. Investors assume Japanese funds would repatriate their money during a true global crisis, pushing the yen higher.
""You can't accuse the markets of over-reacting,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes. ""FX moves are small, slightly lower bond yields, slightly softer equities, but nothing is going mental.""
On Monday, the dollar was last at 108.05 yen , after falling to a three-month trough of 107.77 earlier in the session.

The dollar was steadier against other majors, with the euro up at $1.1202 (EUR=). Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was holding at 96.562.

788,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 07:26AM ET</span>",Defying gravity? What could bring U.S. stocks down to earth,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market's relentless drive higher has caused some nail-biting on Wall Street that the rally is about to end. Geopolitical risks – such as the latest escalation of U.S. tensions with Iran - are just one on a list of worries for 2020.
Stocks ended 2019 with their best year since 2013, with the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) rising nearly 29%. That's put the S&P index at just under the 3,260 level that a Reuters poll forecast the index would achieve at the end of 2020.
Some investors are now increasingly nervous that the year-end ""melt-up"" in shares will turn into a scary melt-down.
Here are some of the risks preoccupying Wall Street as the 2020 gets under way:

PROMISED PROFIT REBOUND FLAILS
The stock market's stunning 2019 gains came despite a lackluster year for corporate profit growth, but performance may suffer if earnings lag in 2020.
Fourth-quarter reporting season starts in the coming days and results are expected to be anemic, with S&P 500 earnings seen down 0.3%, according to Refinitiv data.
But analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to rise 9.7% in 2020. There are some skeptics, notes Chuck Carlson, chief executive at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana, who said bears are ""still having some negative thinking that corporate profits aren’t going to be all that great (in 2020) because the economy is probably going to be a little softer.”
Indeed, data on Friday showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in December by the most in more than a decade.

U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS SOUR
An initial U.S.-China trade agreement provided a year-end boost for stocks, but any hitch in the Phase 1 deal between the world's two largest economies could rattle markets.
""The rivalry between the U.S. and China hasn't gone away,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a recent note.
""Investors will be alert for any sign that tensions are re-emerging, or either side is dissatisfied with the implementation of the Phase 1 agreement,"" Haefele said.
LESS FED SUPPORT
Some point to the Federal Reserve as a trigger.
""When the Fed injects money, funds generally flow to the best-returning market,"" said analysts at Bianco Research in a recent note. ""The big question is, what happens when the Fed ends T-bill purchases and repo support,"" said Bianco.
In October, the Fed announced that it would start buying about $60 billion per month in Treasury bills to ensure ""ample reserves"" in the banking system, a program that would continue at least until the second quarter. The Fed would also continue to support the short-term lending markets by offering daily operations in the market for repurchase agreements, or repo.
""Be wary of a correction in the first half as Fed balance sheet increases wane,"" said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities, in a note.

VOLATILE U.S. POLITICAL LANDSCAPE
Markets will increasingly focus on the U.S. presidential race as Democratic primaries begin next month and the general election in November draws closer.
Several prominent investors have warned of steep stock declines should a progressive candidate secure the Democratic nomination and defeat President Donald Trump. Of particular concern is if Democrats sweep the presidency and both houses of Congress, paving the way for major policy overhauls.
Investors currently see little market risk from the impeachment of Trump. That could change if U.S. senators in Trump's own Republican party begin defecting against him in significant numbers in the Senate trial.
OVERLY OPTIMISTIC INVESTORS
As the market soared in 2019, so did investor bullishness about equities despite rising valuations, a potential sign to be wary.
According to the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, bullish sentiment rose in the Dec. 19 reading to its highest level since October 2018, just before the market endured a year-end swoon. Such bullishness has since pared back to around historical averages.
“Some of the sentiment readings have turned pretty aggressively,"" said Horizon's Carlson. ""While we may not be there yet, that would be something to watch as we go into the early part of 2020, is 'are we getting a little too excited or too ebullient on this market.'”

GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS AND AN OIL SHOCK
Stocks were hit on Friday and investors moved into safe-haven assets after a U.S. air strike in Baghdad killed Iran's most prominent military commander.
“Geopolitics has come back to the table and this is something that could have major cross asset implications,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Management in London.
Oil prices spiked Friday and a surge in the commodity remains a concern. Aside from the situation in Iran, Barry Bannister, Stifel’s head of institutional equity strategy, said Saudi Arabia may look to boost oil prices as it seeks to list ARAMCO on a larger exchange.
December saw WTI rise more than 10% and Brent advance nearly 6%. With the dollar index (DXY) falling 3% in the fourth quarter, continued weakness could result in a further climb in crude prices, and stagflation may result if the dollar continues to weaken while crude prices continue to accelerate.
Beyond flaring Middle East tensions, Haefele of UBS notes that risks regarding Britain's exit from the European Union have ""abated, though not quite disappeared, and while his ""base case is that a hard Brexit is avoided, this will likely remain a concern for investors in coming months."""
789,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 07:07AM ET</span>","Data's the secret weapon for Rappi, SoftBank's big bet in Latin America","By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ""We're going to help you understand your missed opportunities,"" the boss of delivery app Rappi tells restaurants and food brands. ""Why Wednesday is maybe not the best day for you, or why lunch is better than dinner.""
Sebastian Mejia's pitch might seem bold for a delivery firm but it helps explain why Rappi is spending heavily on a lightning expansion across Latin America. It is quietly building up the firepower of its secret weapon: data.
The company, whose couriers' orange backpacks have become familiar features of cities like São Paulo, Bogota and Mexico City, has yet to make a cent of profit after five years.
However, three executives told Reuters that, behind the scenes, Rappi was gathering shopper and sales data that is coveted by consumer brands ranging from food group Nestle (S:NESN) to beermaker  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), as well as restaurants, supermarkets and stores.
The company's rapid expansion could be a high-risk strategy, though, and relies on keeping cash flowing from investors until profits materialize.
""Part of the vision of Rappi is to build an ecosystem,"" 35-year-old co-founder Mejia told Reuters in an interview. ""It's much more than a delivery company.""
The startup, which is valued at an estimated $3.5 billion and backed by Japan's SoftBank (T:9984), has swept across nine countries since 2015. It delivers everything from groceries and restaurant food to medication and furniture, and has branched out into scooter rental, travel and basic banking services.
Every transaction generates data about shoppers such as where they live, what they want and when they need it. Rappi is looking to lure more and more people to the app, a move that would further enrich its data.
Rappi does not hand over individual customer data to its merchants but instead looks at shopping trends, Mejia said.  
The firm next plans to push into more cities across Latin America that have at least 500,000 people, while working on adding more digital banking services, added Mejia, who is from Colombia. The startup has yet to expand deeply into Central America.
'VERY EARLY IN THE GAME'
Gabriel Simões, tech research analyst at Itaú BBA in São Paulo, said the jury was out on Rappi's plan to launch a swathe of services at once in its bid to quickly gain users, rather than focusing on just one core offering, like bringing you lunch.
""They're trying to try to lock more users into their platform,"" he added. ""It could play out well. But it's very early in the game to make sure this is the best strategy or not.""
It's not going to be easy; Rappi faces stiff competition in Latin American deliveries from global players Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Didi Chuxing, as well as a host of local apps like iFood and Cornershop, all trying to eat each other's lunch.
Rappi has an average of more than 10 million active users monthly, according to research firm Apptopia, and says it provides deliveries for almost 100,000 businesses.
Some industry experts raised concerns about the startup's high cash burn and need for fresh funding to maintain its growth. They said Rappi may find it difficult to wean users off the big discounts and promotions it is offering to win them over, which can hinder profitability.
A lunchtime delivery of soup, tacos and a burrito in Mexico City may cost 319 pesos ($16.80), for example, but can end up at just 40 pesos after factoring in offers. Rappi also sends coupons via text, offering deals like 30% off alcohol between 5 and 11 p.m.
Some merchants, meanwhile, said they were reluctant to rely too heavily on Rappi in case the startup failed and that they were looking at developing their own delivery apps.
'NO CHOICE BUT TO KEEP GROWING'
SoftBank invested close to $1 billion in Rappi last April, making the app its biggest bet in Latin America. There is pressure on the Japanese investor to make Rappi a success following steep losses at two of its other big investments, WeWork and Uber.
SoftBank declined to comment on Rappi's strategy.
Rappi's data can help consumer brands as well as the restaurants and grocery stores that sell directly on the platform, according to Luis Techera, head of strategic partnerships for the app in Mexico.
If Gillette, for example, wants to launch a new razor, it can have Rappi send 100,000 samples to people aged between 27 and 35 years old who live in certain neighborhoods.
""Rappi can deliver them in a week to all the users who already bought a Gillette razor, and that's an attack that nobody has,"" Techera said.
Nestle credited Rappi's data for allowing it to analyze shopping habits, from groceries and pharmacies to restaurants.
""Rappi has no choice but to keep growing. We see Rappi as a vehicle that will keep helping the development of e-commerce for groceries,"" said Luis Macin, Nestle's vice president of e-commerce in Mexico.
Asked how soon Rappi would turn a profit, Mejia said his priority was to grow fast, and that investors were on board with the plan.
""I want to get to as many consumers as possible,"" he said. ""I'd rather invest in that than focus on short-term goals or short-term profitability.""
Hendrick Lee, managing partner of Palm Drive Capital which has invested in Rappi, said the startup's spending made sense in its quest to attract the masses.
""I understand why Rappi is burning large amounts of money to get there,"" he added.

790,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 07:04AM ET</span>",Louis Dreyfus owner pledges her stake as collateral in $1 billion Credit Suisse loan: filing,"PARIS (Reuters) - Margarita Louis-Dreyfus borrowed $1 billion from  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) last year to buy out minority shareholders of Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC) and pledged her majority stake in the commodities trader as collateral, a company filing showed.
The loan was used to buy a 16.6% stake in the company from other family members and the share pledge means, if Margarita Louis-Dreyfus can't repay or refinance the loan, Credit Suisse could take control of the 169-year old business.
Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who assumed control of the 169-year-old trading house in 2009 on the death of her husband Robert, sought the loan as the trading firm was trying to settle the costly buyout of minorities and revive flagging profits.
She announced last January that she had completed the purchase of 16.6% of LDC's holding company from other family members, bringing her stake to around 96%.
LDC had previously indicated that its majority owner had obtained a bank loan to finance the buyout, without providing more details.
An annual filing by Akira B.V., which represents the family trust headed by Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, said it had borrowed $1.03 billion from Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd on or about Jan. 25, 2019.
""In anticipation of the borrowing of the foregoing funds, the Company pledged all of its shares of LDHBV to Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd,"" Akira said in the company filing, which was made in the Netherlands on Dec. 31.
LDHBV, short for Louis Dreyfus Holding B.V., is the structure that holds the family's shares in LDC.
The amount borrowed by Akira followed an agreement on Nov. 2, 2018, under which Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd would provide a maximum $1.075 billion in relation to Akira's buyout of other LDC shareholders, the filing showed.
The document did not indicate when the loan should be repaid.
LDC and Credit Suisse did not immediately respond to requests for further details.
The share pledge by Akira was reported previously by Bloomberg.
In November LDC, also known as Dreyfus, launched a cost-cutting plan after a decline in first-half profits which it blamed on international trade tensions and a swine disease epidemic in Asia.
The company also said last year that it may look at selling a stake to a regional player, adding to speculation about industry consolidation.
Dividends have offered some leverage for Margarita Louis-Dreyfus and LDC disclosed in its interim results that it had paid its biggest dividend in five years in 2019.
Akira's filing showed that the vehicle had received a dividend of $241.3 million from LDC's holding structure at the end of March 2019.
The filing also revealed that the price paid by Akira for the 16.6% stake sold by minority shareholders was $824.7 million, broadly in line with previous valuations.
Margarita Louis-Dreyfus is required to purchase shares from other family members wishing to sell under a long-term arrangement established by her late husband."
791,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 06:26AM ET</span>",Drug developers take fresh aim at 'guided-missile' cancer drugs,"By Ludwig Burger and John Miller
FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - Dozens of drugmakers are conducting human trials for a record 89 therapies that pair antibodies with toxic agents to fight cancer, evidence of renewed confidence in an approach that has long fallen short of its promise, an analysis compiled for Reuters shows.
These antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, from companies including AztraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, are described by researchers as ""guided missiles"" packing a powerful anti-cancer punch.
They are engineered to zero in on tumors and then release cytotoxins that deliver up to 10,000 times the potency of standard chemotherapy, while minimizing damage to healthy tissue.
The approach has for decades been a major biotech industry focus. Many experimental ADCs, however, failed due to the complexity of pairing the right antibody with the appropriate toxic agent. Some were abandoned as too weak; others were too harmful.
From 2000 to 2018, only five ADCs won approval. Just one, Roche's (S:ROG) Kadcyla, approved in 2013 for breast cancer, has surpassed $1 billion in annual sales after data last year showed it boosted disease-free survival for some patients compared with the standard treatment, Roche's Herceptin.
Over time, however, scientists devised better ways to connect payloads and antibodies and more precisely reach tumors. There is a growing understanding, too, of how to design ADCs to kill even surrounding cancer cells that previously evaded destruction.
""What we're seeing now are the benefits of the science becoming mature,"" said ADC pioneer Chris Martin, CEO of Switzerland's ADC Therapeutics (N:ADCT). ""It took at least a decade, probably more like 15 years, to really begin to turn the art into a science.""
In 2019, U.S. regulators approved three ADCs, the most ever in a single year, as last-ditch treatments based on studies showing they helped patients whose survival outlook was bleak.
They include AstraZeneca's (L:AZN) and Daiichi Sankyo's (T:4568) breast cancer drug, Enhertu, which was shown to help patients who had failed numerous previous treatments survive a median of more than 16 months before their disease worsened.
Astellas' (T:4503) and Seattle Genetics' (O:SGEN) bladder cancer drug, Padcev, also received expedited approval in December, based on evidence that 44% of patients who had failed immunotherapy showed improvement, and in some cases, no evidence of cancer, when they were assessed after treatment.
Roche's (S:ROG) Polivy was green-lighted against lymphoma in June after producing complete response rates, with no signs of disease, in 40% of patients when combined with two other therapies.
NEW RECORD
While all three drugs must prove their mettle in further studies, the industry is growing optimistic that ADCs' time may have arrived.
The number of ADC drug candidates is at unprecedented levels, according to data from consultancy Beacon Targeted Therapies compiled for Reuters, based on a review of companies' pipelines. Dozens more ADC prospects are in pre-clinical review.
London-based Beacon advises drugmakers on targeted therapies, helping them decide whether to pursue prospective drugs or redirect efforts, based on industry trends.
Current ADC projects include GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) testing its belantamab mafodotin against multiple myeloma.
ADC Therapeutics, part-owned by private equity firm Auven Therapeutics, has several studies on experimental drugs, including with Danish partner  Genmab  (CO:GMAB), on blood cancers and solid tumors.
U.S. biotech Immunomedics' (O:IMMU) market capitalization gained more than 60% to $4.3 billion in the last six months, ahead of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's late-December decision to review its ADC against triple-negative breast cancer, which is hard to treat and has poor prognosis.
Massachusetts-based  ImmunoGen  (O:IMGN), hit by past trial failures, got a lift in December for its ADC against ovarian cancer when the FDA indicated it may become a candidate for accelerated approval.
The surge in ADC investment has been fueled, in part, by improvements in the so-called ""linker"" technology that binds the antibody to its cancer-killing toxins, keeping them stable in the circulatory system until the poison can be unleashed on the targeted tumour.
ADCs are generally delivered via repeated infusions, similar to chemotherapy.
""There is a revival again because there is a new generation of molecules in which the linker is more efficient,"" Giuseppe Curigliano, clinical director of early drug development at Milan's European Institute of Oncology, told Reuters.
BETTING ON GROWTH
This optimism has contract manufacturers like Merck KGaA (DE:MRCG) and Lonza (S:LONN) ramping up facilities, in hopes drugmakers will farm out complex ADC production.
Merck expects the overall ADC market to grow by more than 20% in coming years, boosting its business, which includes manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies, linkers and cytotoxic agents.
Rival Lonza, which helps make Roche's two ADCs and sees annual 9% growth for the so-called bioconjugates market, is investing millions of dollars in its Swiss site, where it produces ADCs for other drugmakers.
""What we see over time at Lonza is a good request for capacity,"" said Iwan Bertholjotti, Lonza's bioconjugate commercial development head. ""That's a good sign that the market is booming.""

GRAPHIC: ADC clinical development https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/252/252/Ludwig2.png
Still, enthusiasm is not universal.
AbbVie (N:ABBV) in August abandoned its ADC candidate Rova-T after flunking a lung cancer trial and wrote off most of the $5.8 billion it paid for the drug's developer, Stemcentrx, in 2016.
Roche, which helped pioneer ADCs with Kadcyla and Polivy, has also backed off. In 2013, the Basel-based company had about a dozen experimental ADCs. Today, only one remains, and it is being developed for Staph infections, not cancer.
""We have shifted our technology priorities,"" Roche CEO Severin Schwan told Reuters. ""Maybe others will be luckier, but we failed to master the complexity.""
AstraZeneca aims to do just that.
In March, the Cambridge, England-based drugmaker struck a $7 billion deal with Japan's Daiichi Sankyo for rights to Enhertu, getting $1.35 billion up-front, and more if it challenges Roche drugs' dominance in breast cancer.
Some industry analysts see Enhertu sales eventually reaching up to $7 billion annually.
""Our plan is to expand the number of studies in different tumor types,"" said Gilles Gallant, head of oncology R&D at Daiichi Sankyo. ""This agent has potential."""

Andre de Ruyter, appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa in November, will oversee a government plan to split Eskom into three units for generation, transmission and distribution in an attempt to make it more efficient.
Ramaphosa is trying to revive growth in Africa's most advanced economy and attract more investments. Eskom, which generates more than 90% of the country's power, is widely regarded as the most serious risk to an economy on the brink of recession.
Saddled with unreliable coal-fired power stations, Eskom has struggled to meet the country's power demand since 2007, with several bouts of severe power cuts since then. Outages last year dented economic output and shook investor confidence in Ramaphosa's administration.
The country experienced further outages at the weekend, with Eskom cutting up to 2,000 megawatts (MW) from the national grid on Saturday and Sunday due to a shortage of generating capacity.
In a previous role as CEO of  Nampak  (J:NPKJ) de Ruyter steered the packaging firm through financial difficulties, and part of his new brief is to restructure Eskom's 450 billion rand ($31 billion) debt pile.
De Ruyter's predecessor at Eskom, Phakamani Hadebe, stepped down in July, citing health reasons. Sources told Reuters at the time that another reason was that he felt frustrated at being excluded from important decisions affecting the utility.
Eskom said in a statement on Monday that roughly 13,000 megawatts (MW) of its 44,000 MW nominal capacity were offline because of plant breakdowns.
It said it didn't expect ""load-shedding "" - a local term for power cuts - on Monday but that the system was ""constrained and vulnerable"".

794,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 03:59AM ET</span>",HSBC Walks Tricky Political Tightrope Between Hong Kong and Beijing,"(Bloomberg) -- The two bronze lion statues standing guard over  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) Plc’s main offices in Hong Kong still bear the marks of an attack by protesters, who last week daubed them with red and black paint, setting at least one ablaze. Graffiti declared that HSBC had been dyed the red of China.
HSBC has vowed to restore the iconic lions to their former glory. But the Asia-focused lender may not find it so easy to disentangle itself from deepening tensions in its biggest market at a time when its new leadership must also repair a relationship with Beijing that’s been weakened by the Huawei Technologies Co. probe.
The bank became the target of the public’s ire in Hong Kong after the police arrested four people linked to a group that helps pro-democracy protesters pay legal fees. HSBC had closed an account used by the group in November.
Bank executives are finding it increasingly hard to keep focused on business and steer clear of politics, said a senior executive in Asia, who asked not to be named discussing internal matters. Political tension on the streets is also causing rifts among HSBC staff. Younger local employees in the Hong Kong office tend to be supportive of the pro-democracy movement, while those with business and personal ties to the mainland are more neutral or pro-Beijing, staff interviewed by Bloomberg said, asking not to be named speaking on a sensitive issue.
With two-thirds of its profit at stake, the London-based firm has previously been able to stay away from controversy as political tensions roiled Hong Kong and dragged in peers including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). Chinese retailers and branches of lenders like Bank of China Ltd. have been targeted, while Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and the National Basketball Association came under pressure from Beijing after employees supported the demonstrations.
HSBC has said its decision to close the protest-linked account was unrelated to the police action. It’s condemned acts of vandalism against its property as “unjustified” and promised to restore the defaced lions, which it said “form parts of the bank’s and Hong Kong’s history.”
The decision was made after finding unusual transactions, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the bank risked being punished by regulators for any negligence. They asked not to be identified because the matter is private.
“HSBC is now joining Cathay Pacific in discovering that politics and business can’t always be easily reconciled,” said Brock Silvers, managing director at Adamas Asset Management in Hong Kong. The pro-democracy protests are “doubly negative” in that they “detract from the local market while simultaneously complicating the Chinese market,” he said.
A spokeswoman for HSBC didn’t comment beyond the statements released by the bank when contacted by Bloomberg.
Navigating the politics of the protests is one of several challenges facing interim Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn, who is also dealing with the fallout from HSBC’s assistance with a U.S. probe into Huawei and the wider impact of the U.S.-China trade war.
HSBC was singled out for contributing to the arrest of Huawei’s Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on charges of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and Syria. The bank has made the case that it had no choice but to help the U.S. Department of Justice probe. The formal hearings for Meng’s extradition to the U.S. begin Jan. 20 in Vancouver.
The bank is working to improve relations with China, launching a public-relations offensive aimed at leaders in Beijing after missing out on several business licenses.
Bank Overhaul
Hong Kong and China together contributed two thirds of HSBC’s adjusted pretax profit in the first three quarters last year. The group has $1.1 trillion of assets across Asia, according to its interim report last year, with a majority concentrated in Hong Kong.
Born as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. in 1865, HSBC has been shifting more resources to Asia, especially China, since 2015 as part of a strategy initiated by Stuart Gulliver and strengthened under the leadership of John Flint, who was ousted in August. Acting chief Quinn will make his pitch to keep the top job next month as the bank undertakes its biggest overhaul in years.
The lender has warned of write-offs, plans to pare back underperforming businesses and people familiar with the matter have said it will try to sell its French retail bank.
It’s the Asian operations that offer the greatest promise and now, some of the biggest challenges.
Hong Kong is HSBC’s single biggest market with 21,000 employees. In China, it has ramped up its investment across financial sectors including commercial banking, credit cards, investment banking and wealth management. The bank now employs more than 8,000 staff as the largest foreign bank in China, according to its website.
As the tensions in the former British colony show few signs of abating, campaigns against the Chinese firms have now expanded to include HSBC. Some protesters have linked the account closure to the police arrests for suspected money laundering, taking to online forums and rallies claiming HSBC has betrayed the Hong Kong people. Bank’s branches and ATMs have been vandalized in areas including Wan Chai and Mong Kok.
One employee who regularly donates to groups that support the protests said she was sad after the lions were vandalized because they are seen as spiritual leaders and HSBC was innocent in this case. She said she won’t turn against the protesters, but feared that some of her colleagues would change their mind.
Stephen and Stitt, the two lions, have been covered by hoardings. The sign on front promised: “They will return.”

795,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 03:49AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco Faces Tough Test Less Than a Month After IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco’s status as an oil-producing behemoth located in one of the world’s most turbulent regions always marked it as likely to suffer bouts of volatility.
But few could have expected the stock to face so stern a test less than a month after the company’s historic $25.6 billion initial offering.
The world’s most profitable company extended declines Monday after dropping to its lowest closing price yet a day earlier, as the U.S. killing of Iran’s most prominent general last week triggered fresh concern of a wider conflict in the Gulf region. The move suggests that rising oil prices -- Brent crude has climbed above $70 a barrel for the first time since May on a closing basis -- aren’t necessarily a boon for the energy giant.
Aramco (SE:2222) fell 0.6% as of 10:32 a.m. in Riyadh to 34.35 riyals, narrowing its gain to 7.3% since it listed at 32 riyals on Dec. 11. It tumbled 1.7% Sunday.
While Aramco has performed better than Saudi Arabia’s benchmark Tadawul index this week, the sudden rise in geopolitical tension comes just as the end of the stabilization period for the shares nears.
“The risks will remain over the near term as both the United States and Iran aim threats at one another,” said Jameel Ahmad, a markets analyst at FXTM in London. The drop in Aramco shares “is a natural reaction to the coordinated risk aversion that has swept global sentiment since the events at the end of last week.”
The missile attack that killed Iran’s General Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump, was a reminder of the risks of investing in the region. In September, Saudi Arabia’s oil production was cut by half after a swarm of explosive drones struck some of its most important production facilities. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for the attack, while Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility.
Aramco was back pumping 9.9 million barrels a day just one month after the attacks and the company pressed ahead with what was to be the world’s biggest IPO.
Risk Premium
At the time of the sale, many foreign investors cited geopolitical risk as reasons to stay away from the shares, and considered them too expensive. Even after this week’s fall, Aramco has a valuation of $1.8 trillion, easily the highest among listed companies.
Aramco still has some built-in protection because the shares are mostly in the hands of those used to regional politics, mitigating selling pressure at times of tension. Saudi government institutions invested almost $2.3 billion in the IPO. The government also relied heavily on ordinary Saudis and funds from neighboring Gulf Arab monarchies to ensure the success of the offering.
On top of that,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is acting as share-stabilizing manager for the offering until the end of this week and can buy shares as part of that. It also has the right to exercise a so-called greenshoe option of 450 million shares, which would normally be used if the stock was rising too fast. No price-stabilization transactions had been executed as of Dec. 31, according to a statement from Aramco.
“Very few active managers are in the stock and most shareholders are either government-related entities, quasi-passive or passive,” said Marwan Haddad, senior portfolio manager at Emirates NBD Asset Management in Dubai. “Therefore volatility would be low unless an actual attack takes place, which we believe has a low probability. Moreover, as the oil price goes up, downside risk falls.”

799,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 02:07AM ET</span>",Trump administration pressed Dutch hard to cancel China chip-equipment sale: sources,"By Alexandra Alper, Toby Sterling and Stephen Nellis
WASHINGTON/AMSTERDAM/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Trump administration mounted an extensive campaign to block the sale of Dutch chip manufacturing technology to China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lobbying the Netherlands government and White House officials sharing a classified intelligence report with the country's Prime Minister, people familiar with the effort told Reuters. 
The high-level push, which has not previously been reported, demonstrates the importance the White House places on preventing China from getting hold of a machine required to make the world's fastest microprocessors. It also shows the challenges facing the U.S. government's largely unilateral efforts to stem the flow of advanced technology to China. 
The U.S. campaign began in 2018, after the Dutch government gave semiconductor equipment company ASML, the global leader in a critical chip-making process known as lithography, a license to sell its most advanced machine to a Chinese customer, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Over the following months, U.S officials examined whether they could block the sale outright and held at least four rounds of talks with Dutch officials, three sources told Reuters. 
The effort culminated in the White House on July 18 when Deputy National Security Advisor Charles Kupperman raised the issue with Dutch officials during the visit of Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who was given an intelligence report on the potential repercussions of China acquiring ASML's technology, according to a former U.S. government official familiar with the matter.
The pressure appears to have worked. Shortly after the White House visit, the Dutch government decided not to renew ASML's export license, and the $150 million machine has not been shipped.
Ilse van Oevering, a spokeswoman for Rutte's office, declined comment, saying the government cannot discuss individual licensing cases. 
The White House declined to comment. Kupperman did not reply to a request for comment. 
The delayed shipment was first reported on Nov. 6 by the Nikkei Asian Review, but details of the U.S. pressure campaign have not previously been disclosed. ASML said it is still awaiting approval of a new license request and declined further comment.
ASML has never publicly disclosed the identity of the Chinese customer, but Nikkei and others have reported that it is Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), China's biggest chip-making specialist. SMIC did not reply to a request for a comment. 
SECURITY INTEREST
The ASML machine uses extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light beams, generated by lasers and focused by giant mirrors, to lay out extraordinarily narrow circuits on slabs of silicon known as wafers. That in turn makes it possible to create faster and more powerful microprocessors, memory chips and other advanced components, which are critical for consumer electronics and military applications alike.
Only a few companies, including America's  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Taiwan's TSMC, are currently capable of manufacturing the most sophisticated chips. But China has made catching up to those companies in chip-making technology a key national priority and is investing tens of billions of dollars in the effort.
That drive has run head-on into the Trump administration's efforts to block the flow of sensitive technology to China on national security grounds. Companies selling U.S.-made goods are now barred from shipping them to blacklisted Chinese firms including telecoms giant Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and surveillance vendor Hikvision without a special license.
The U.S. government can also deny licenses to firms that want to sell goods made with U.S. technology to any Chinese company, not just those on the export blacklist. But blocking companies like ASML that manufacture overseas is much more difficult. 
Under current regulations, the U.S. can require a license for many high-tech products shipped to China from other countries if U.S.-made components make up more than 25% of the value. The U.S. Department of Commerce conducted an audit of ASML's EUV machine, two sources told Reuters, but found it did not meet the 25% threshold, according to one of the people.
The U.S. Department of Commerce is now considering lowering the 25% threshold in some cases, Reuters reported in November. 
With no way to block the sale directly, the Trump administration pressed its Dutch ally to consider the security issues. Lithography equipment falls under the purview of an international agreement known as the Wassenaar Arrangement, which coordinates export restrictions of so-called 'dual-use' technology that has commercial and military applications.
U.S. Department of Defense officials met their Dutch counterparts several times to discuss the security risks of the sale, two sources told Reuters. Meetings took place at the Netherlands embassy in Washington in late 2018 and January 2019, two separate sources said. 
Pompeo urged Rutte himself to block the sale, despite commercial pressures to let ASML proceed, during a visit to the Netherlands last June, three sources said. 
With a market value of more than 110 billion euros, ASML has grown to dominate the lithography market over the last two decades and is the pride of Dutch industry.
""Our ask is that our allies and our partners and friends don't do anything that would endanger our shared security interest,"" Pompeo told reporters in The Hague on June 3. He did not mention chip equipment specifically.
The U.S. Department of State did not reply to a request for comment. 
Six weeks later, during his visit to the White House, Rutte was given a copy of the intelligence report. Reuters could not determine whether U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned the ASML deal to Rutte during the White House meeting.
ASML's export license expired unused on June 30, 2019, and no new license was granted in the following eight-week period during which a renewal request would normally be considered, according to a public database of licenses published by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
    Netherlands Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Irene Gerritsen said the Dutch government has sovereign discretion to grant licenses of dual-use technology and would not comment on specific cases.

With or without the EUV license, ASML expects its Chinese sales to increase in 2020 as it continues to ship earlier-generation equipment.

800,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 02:01AM ET</span>","UBS, JPMorgan See Little Asian Market Impact From U.S.-Iran Tensions","(Bloomberg) -- Escalating friction between the U.S. and Iran will likely have limited impact on Asian stock markets, according to UBS Global Wealth Management and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
Following the U.S. airstrike that killed Iran’s top military commander Qassem Soleimani last week, Iran said it will no longer abide by any limits on its enrichment of uranium and Iraq’s parliament voted to expel U.S. troops from the country.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell as much as 1.1% Monday, as traders returned from holidays. The impact was especially pronounced in Japan, where the stock market reopened after a four-day holiday to find a much stronger yen. Oil and gold continued to climb.
The geopolitical crisis added a new angle for money managers and advisers looking for direction on 2020 after a global rally that pushed the Asian equity benchmark up 16% last year. Here’s what market participants are saying about the impact of the Middle East situation on their strategies.
Short-lived impact
Previous periods of increased tensions suggest that the impact on broader markets tends to be “short-lived,” said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management in Zurich.
He said worried investors should consider the less-volatile options market, and recommended dynamic and systematic allocation strategies for portfolio diversification, or structured notes “that offer a degree of capital protection.”
Oil and earnings
The market impact will largely be determined by the effect on oil prices, and to what degree this is already priced in, said Kerry Craig, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. While most Asian economies are net oil importers, rising global trade volumes and a reviving manufacturing cycle are “supportive of earnings in Asian markets,” where estimates are on the rise.
“2019 illustrates that uncertainty doesn’t have to be the enemy of investors given the strong market returns in spite of heightened political tensions,” he added.
Move on
The Middle East situation could distract the U.S. from pursuing its trade conflict with China, said Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors in Singapore. The trade deal between the world’s two largest economies is still a more important factor for Japanese stocks, he said.
“We suspect the market will soon get bored” of the U.S.-Iran conflict and “move on,” Anvarzadeh said. A belligerent North Korea poses a bigger potential geopolitical shock to Japan’s market, he added.
Resilient economies
Margaret Yang, a strategist at CMC Markets Singapore, said the crisis “may prove to be short-lived,” adding that it will likely have limited impact on Asian economies despite the short-term negative market sentiment.
Yang, who is positive on emerging-market assets, said there will likely be a cyclical recovery in global manufacturing activities and improving business conditions following a U.S.-China trade truce.
Stay the course
Bharat Joshi, an investment director for Aberdeen Standard Investments Indonesia, plans no “short-term shift” based on geopolitical concerns. While gold and oil may climb in the near term, this “should normalize over time,” he said.
“Our investment theses are usually based on fundamentals of countries and companies, which continue to hold up,” Joshi said."

802,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>",Samsung to draw line under lackluster 2019 with chip revival in store,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - With Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics (KS:005380) expected to suffer its biggest annual profit drop in at least a decade, investors are counting on an expected uptick in the memory-chip market to cure the tech giant's ills this year.
When it issues preliminary fourth-quarter results on Jan. 8, the world's top maker of memory chips used in smartphones, laptops and servers is set to post a 40% slump in operating profit to 6.48 trillion won ($5.56 billion), according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, weighted towards more consistently accurate analysts. 
The three months ended December are expected to mark the South Korean firm's fifth year-on-year decline in quarterly profit, ending a year marred by bloated stockpiles of chips that squeezed prices, and the U.S.-China trade war that roiled global supply chains and prospects for consumer demand.
With 2018 having been a record year for earnings, last year's slump likely means Samsung posted its biggest percentage drop in annual profit in at least a decade. 
But with the United States suspending planned December tariffs on Chinese goods, including mobile phones and laptops, concerns about demand have eased as optimism for the rollout of new 5G networks around the world has grown.
""We expect overall market recovery in the first quarter of 2020,"" said Michael Yang, a director at IHS Markit. ""Both solid demand forecast from the server/hyperscale (infrastructure) customers and optimism around 5G smartphone adoption are the drivers for growth.""
Reflecting that mood, analysts polled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate expect Samsung's annual profit to surge nearly 40% in 2020. The company itself doesn't typically issue full-year earnings estimates.
Despite 2019's tough times for the world of chips, Samsung still generated half of its January-September profit from the business. That core strength, along with optimism for 2020, helped Samsung's shares ride out weak earnings to end last year with a 44% gain, compared with an 8% rise for the Seoul benchmark index. 
Still, many industry experts remain cautious about the strength of recovery this year.
""The chip market will rebound in 2020 from a low base last year, but it is premature to expect a boom (like that) seen in 2017,"" said Park Jun-hong, a director at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings.
Samsung, also the world's leading maker of mobile phones, TVs and displays, itself echoes that caution. It flagged last week what it said would be a more difficult global economy this year, hurt by rising political uncertainty and a possible slump in consumption.

S&P 500 Index futures contracts expiring in March were down 0.3% as of 2:45 p.m. in Tokyo, after the attack prompted Iraq’s parliament to vote to expel U.S. troops from the country. Iran said it would no longer abide by any limits on its enrichment of uranium. Futures on both the Nasdaq 100 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.3%.
“The risk-on tone that had continued into the new year was disrupted last week with the return of geopolitical tensions, which heightened only further over the weekend with threats exchanged between the U.S. and Iran,” said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte. “Short-term weakness in the equity space may also ensue as the market evaluates the good run we have seen so far on the likes of trade hopes.”
Geopolitical tension has been virtually the only thing capable of knocking U.S. equities off an upward march that began five months ago. The S&P 500 is coming off its best year in six, adding almost 30% in 2019. Its biggest monthly decline in the past year came in May, when the U.S.-China trade war heated up and the Trump administration put Huawei Technologies Co. on a blacklist.
Markets may be especially susceptible to shocks right now with the S&P 500 trading at almost 22 times earnings, near its bull-market peak. A valuation model from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management showed stocks are overvalued relative to the historical average when measured against earnings, long-term earnings, book value and cash flow.
Market Breather
“We have to remember that the market is coming off of a very strong rally, so it’s natural that the buyers would pull in their horns a little bit,” said Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co.
At the same time, geopolitical events like last week’s attack haven’t created lasting market disruption, according to a note Sunday from Suntrust. The firm looked at 12 comparable instances and found equities were lower 12 months later only three times, each coinciding with a recession.
“The drop in futures thus far is within Friday’s trading range,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, said via email. “Fundamentals are still pointing higher and this should keep ‘buyers on the dip’ prevalent if/when Iran tensions cause it to sell off.”"

Portugal, Ireland and Belgium should issue debt maturing in 10 to 15 years at syndicated sales, according to Danske Bank A/S, while regular auctions are due from Germany, Austria, Spain and France. After several months of sagging prices, global bonds are back in demand as haven assets following a U.S. airstrike that killed an Iranian general, sparking fears of a wider conflict.
Bonds could also advance as investors snap up the securities to sell on to the European Central Bank under its latest asset-purchasing program. The ECB relaunched its quantitative easing operation in November, at a pace of 20 billion-euro ($22 billion) per month, increasing demand for regional debt.
“In 2020, the ECB is again set to buy in the secondary market,” wrote Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank. “This would be very supportive for the smaller markets such as Ireland and Portugal.”
Sorensen expects the two nations, and to some extent Belgium, to stick to the “usual” amounts in terms of sizes given their limited funding needs. He sees Ireland, Portugal and Belgium issuing four billion euros, six billion euros and three billion euros respectively. Germany will sell a new five-billion euro bond maturing in 10 years on Wednesday."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean restaurant owners expressed concern on Monday over food delivery giant Delivery Hero's (DE:DHER) proposed $4 billion acquisition of its local rival, saying the move could undermine competition and lead to higher fees.
Delivery Hero, the second-largest food delivery app operator in South Korea, said last month that it agreed to buy larger rival Woowa Brothers backed by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a deal subject to antitrust approval.
The combination of the two giants would create an entity with a combined market share of nearly 99% in food delivery apps, according to data from mobile big data platform IGAWorks.
Restaurant owners, already struggling with the slowing economy, raised concerns that the dominant player would raise commissions that it charges restaurant owners for taking orders via their apps.
""The biggest problem is that the companies can move the market to whatever direction they want to,"" said Kim Kyung-moo, who runs a franchise restaurant, said at a news conference at the parliament.
Restaurant owners, food delivery riders and lawmakers urged the fair trade commission to thoroughly review the potential merger, which they said could also limit consumer choices.
A spokesman at Woowa Brother told Reuters that the firm is not planning on increasing commission fees.​​​​​​
South Korea, with a dense population and high smartphone use, is the world's fourth biggest market for online food orders, with an annual value of $5.9 billion.
Berlin-bgased Delivery Hero last week submitted an application to the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) for an approval, an official at the antitrust regulator said, declining to comment further as a review is in progress.
In 2009, the watchdog approved U.S. online commerce firm eBay Inc's (O:EBAY) deal to acquire local rival Gmarket in South Korea on the conditions that there would be a ban on raising sales commissions for the next three years."

Benchmark yields have slid almost 30 basis points since mid-December, thanks largely to the central bank’s unconventional policy action to buy long-end debt while selling short-end notes. Still, the lingering concern about the government’s fiscal slippage and the risk of a potential rebound in inflation has funds cutting down on duration.
“We have a lot of uncertainty in the bond market in the near term,” said Pankaj Pathak, a fixed-income fund manager at Quantum Asset Management Co. in Mumbai. “Apart from fiscal risks, crude oil prices have moved up, vegetable prices have been stubborn at higher levels and the geopolitical scenario has changed for worse.”
The Reserve Bank of India will conduct its third Federal Reserve-style Operation Twist in a month on Monday. The unprecedented moves have come after uncertainty about public finances pushed up the 10-year sovereign yield to near a three-month high of 6.84% last month.

808,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 11:41PM ET</span>",China’s New Hong Kong Liaison Confident City Will Stabilize,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s new top official in Hong Kong said he is certain the city will stabilize following months of political unrest, backing leader Carrie Lam and her administration in his first public comments since being appointed.
“I am fully confident about this,” Luo Huining, the new director of the Hong Kong Liaison office, said at a media briefing Monday. “Everyone fervently hopes that Hong Kong can get back on track. As President Xi Jinping said in his New Year’s address, without a harmonious and stable environment, how could there be a peaceful home? I sincerely wish Hong Kong and Hong Kongers well.”
The installation of Luo, a Communist Party stalwart known for faithfully executing Xi’s anti-corruption campaign, signals Beijing’s intention to restore law and order after nearly seven months of political unrest. He takes over from Wang Zhimin, the Chinese government said in a Saturday statement that didn’t elaborate on the move.
Luo served as party secretary in China’s Shanxi province until November, and became deputy chairman of the financial and economic committee of the powerful National People’s Congress last month. While Chinese media has credited him with enforcing the central government’s campaign to purge corruption and weed out disloyal officials in Shanxi, he has no direct experience in Hong Kong.
“Luo seems to have had the experience to end chaos and restore stability in Shanxi,” said Victoria Hui, associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame. “Since the outbreak of anti-extradition protests, Beijing has been trying to rein in Hong Kong.”
“It’s not clear why a strongman like him was not picked earlier,” she said.
‘Long Predicted’
Chinese and Hong Kong officials have frequently been caught off guard by developments during the unrest. Communications between Beijing and Hong Kong are mainly conducted through the Liaison Office, which was established in 2000 to replace the New China News Agency, Beijing’s unofficial representative during the British colonial era.
The Liaison Office, which reports to China’s State Council, is a powerful but mysterious institution that represents Beijing’s interests in the former colony. A former head of the office’s research department wrote in 2008 that the office’s staff, as well as other mainland officials working on Hong Kong issues, constitute a second “governing team” that functions alongside Hong Kong’s formal government. The office also helps supervise Chinese state-owned enterprises in the city and manage media and real estate holdings.

Speculation about Wang’s removal had been growing, particularly after pro-government candidates suffered a resounding defeat in Hong Kong district council elections in November that reportedly caught Beijing by surprise. While the polls were for the lowest rung of the city’s government, the results amounted to a public rebuke of Beijing.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in a statement Saturday that she had worked briefly with Luo when he was running Shanxi and that she had “no doubt” that he would help promote “prosperity and stability” in Hong Kong. She praised Wang for serving during “unprecedented social unrest” and “providing staunch support” to the city’s government.
Wang’s dismissal “was long predicted because he appeared to be associated too closely with pro-Beijing elites and business leaders, without reaching out widely to all social sectors,” said Sonny Lo, a Hong Kong-based academic and political commentator. Wang’s “miscalculations” may have led to his downfall, particularly following the elections, Lo said.
Despite consistent backing from Beijing, Lam has seen her popularity tumble over months of often-violent protests that show no signs of abating. The unrest has rattled Hong Kong’s tourism and retail sectors and risks undermining its reputation as a global business center. Protests continued Sunday as dozens of people were arrested in the Sheung Shui district after an approved march, and police said they fired tear gas in response to a petrol bomb attack on a local train station.

“Luo’s appointment probably signals a hard-line policy from Beijing -- that we don’t give a damn about your feelings,” said Chen Zhao, co-founder of the Montreal-based research firm Alpine Macro. “He’s just a party boss -- he has no connection with Hong Kong and no foreign affairs expertise.” Whereas Wang knew Lam well, he said, “Luo has no relationship with the business community or political arena in Hong Kong.”
Luo’s appointment follows Xi’s New Year’s Eve defense of China’s system of governance over Hong Kong -- an unusually high-profile acknowledgment of the city’s political turmoil.
“One country, two systems is the biggest advantage,” Luo said Monday.

Masako Mori declined to give any details of how Ghosn managed to exit without a trace, telling reporters on Monday that the matter is under investigation. This was the first time a government official has held a news conference about Ghosn’s departure since reports emerged almost a week ago that the former chief of Nissan Motor Co. and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) had secretly made his way to Lebanon.
Ghosn, arrested in November 2018 on charges of financial crimes, had been free on bail as he awaited a trial that was scheduled to start this year. He has denied all of the charges, saying that they were part of a conspiracy to prevent further integration between the two automakers.
Mori mostly reiterated remarks from a statement the previous day, saying that Ghosn was thought to have used illegal measures and that this was extremely regrettable. She defended the Japanese criminal justice system, which Ghosn and others have repeatedly attacked as unfair. Mori said the system protected individual rights and was implemented appropriately.
Inspectors at Japan’s Kansai Airport didn’t conduct X-ray checks on large cases that were brought aboard a private jet on which Ghosn is thought to have made his getaway, public broadcaster NHK reported Sunday.
Nissan shares fell to their lowest since 2011 as of midday in Tokyo, following the Ghosn news, an extended bank holiday in Japan and weak U.S. auto sales figures."

812,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 09:41PM ET</span>",China Vows Support to ‘Win’ Battle Against Mounting Bank Risks,"(Bloomberg) -- China pledged to step up measures to shore up its troubled banks and small businesses while continuing a crackdown on shadow banking and property speculation, in a difficult balancing act that risks exacerbating a build up in bad debt at its traditional lenders.
As concerns mount over the state of China’s $45 trillion financial system, the nation’s central bank and its top financial regulator used the year’s first weekend to unveil fresh details on how to combat risks amid the slowest economic expansion in three decades.
The People’s Bank of China, which has been reluctant to prime the stimulus pumps too much, said on Sunday that it would “resolutely win the battle” against increasing financial risks, underscoring its role as a lender of last resort while directing local governments to step up front-line support.
That followed a statement from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission outlining a series of measures including carving out bad loans, setting up a resolution fund, as well as promoting mergers, capital injections and the restructuring of high risk institutions.
“Risk control has always been on the agenda of the authority, but compared with the previous general guidelines regulators have used strong wording in laying out very specific, drastic measures,” said Zhao Jian, head of the Atlantis Financial Research Institute in Beijing. “That’s a signal policy makers are beefing up efforts to contain financial risks this year.”
With the economy also weighed down by a trade dispute with the U.S., Chinese authorities are taking a more coordinated approach to tackling the problems at the more than 3,000 regional and rural lenders, many of which are struggling with a pileup of soured loans, eroding capital and poor internal controls.
Confidence in these institutions has waned since May, when regulators seized control of a lender in Inner Mongolia -- the first such move in two decades -- and imposed losses on some creditors. Authorities have since orchestrated bailouts of two other banks and intervened to quell at least two bank runs by jittery depositors.
The regulator also said it will continue to press on with its two-year campaign against shadowing banking by reducing financial institutions’ non-compliant investments in non-standard assets, which are mostly loans disguised as investments. Insurers should clean up investments that can flow through several products and leveraged transactions between related parties, it said.
The banking regulator said it would improve risk management in areas such as real estate by preventing speculative housing deals and blocking illegal flows of funds into properties. The central bank, meanwhile, announced it would build a long-term regulatory mechanism to more closely monitor financing to the sector.
China financial market faces a pivotal year as it opens to full foreign ownership. The regulator, which reiterated its commitment to overseeing the opening, is in part counting on the sharpened competition to instill more discipline in its domestic firms. Starting with its futures and insurance markets this month, the nation is enacting the most sweeping changes in decades to allow the likes of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). to expand their footprint in China.
The CBIRC also encouraged the conversion of household savings to more long-term capital investments and a greater development of corporate annuity and endowment insurance businesses. The regulator wants wealth management, insurance and trust products to be directly involved in financing and cultivating long-term investments."
813,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 09:06PM ET</span>",Fugitive financier Jho Low denies being 'mastermind' behind 1MDB,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Fugitive Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho has said he only acted as an intermediary for deals involving 1MDB, denying in an interview published on Monday that he had set the stage for the theft of billions of dollars from the Malaysian state fund.
Low faces charges in the United States and Malaysia for his alleged central role in defrauding up to $4.5 billion from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), founded by former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and the subject of the U.S. Department of Justice's largest ever anti-kleptocracy case.
Low, or Jho Low as he is popularly known, has consistently denied wrongdoing and says the charges against him are politically motivated.
""People and companies act as introducers or intermediaries all the time,"" Low said in an interview with Singapore's Straits Times.
""This is not a unique situation. I was requested to assist because of my good relationships with influential foreign businessmen and decision makers.""
A spokesman for Low did not immediately respond to a request for additional comments.
To a question on why he has remained on the run, Low said the Malaysian government has victimized him and his family, ignoring ""basic human rights and fair judicial processes"" by branding him as the mastermind behind the scandal.
Malaysia's prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Low said his ""professional connections"" had helped Malaysia build strong ties with key allies, particularly Saudi Arabia, boosting Haj pilgrimage quotas for Malaysian Muslims and investments in financial, real estate and other sectors in the Southeast Asian country.
Low declined to divulge his current location but confirmed he was offered asylum in August last year. He did not name the country offering asylum.
In November, U.S. authorities struck a deal with Low to recoup $1 billion in funds allegedly looted from 1MDB, which included a private jet, high-end real estate in Beverly Hills, New York and London, and other assets.
The deal does not include an admission of guilt or wrongdoing and is not tied to the criminal action against Low.
Low - who said he has had ""multiple brushes with cancer"" - said he now plans to focus on investing in cutting-edge cancer research.
""I would cherish the opportunity to reinvigorate my philanthropic efforts and to give back to the community and help others in any way I can."""
814,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 08:21PM ET</span>","Trump Vows Sanctions on Ally Iraq, Toughens Rhetoric on Iran","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump warned Iran of major U.S. retaliation and threatened heavy sanctions on Iraq if American troops are forced to leave unless the country repays billions in military base construction costs.
Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, said going into the Middle East was the worst decision the U.S. has ever made, and that the U.S. had spent billions of dollars building a military base in the country.
“We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that’s there. It cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time. We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it,” Trump told reporters while flying back from Florida. “If they do ask us to leave, if we don’t do it in a very friendly basis. We will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever. It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.”
Trump’s remarks ratchet up tensions on a day when Iraqi lawmakers voted to pursue the removal of foreign troops from the nation -- the latest fallout from the U.S. killing last week of Qassem Soleimani, an Iranian general.
Trump also doubled down on threats to Iran, saying he’s still willing to hit cultural sites among 52 targets in the event that Iran retaliates for Soleimani’s death by striking an American or U.S. facility.
“They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way,” Trump said. “If they do anything there will be major retaliation.”
Trump also spoke briefly about North Korea, predicting of leader Kim Jong Un: “I don’t think he’d break his word to me but maybe he will.”"

S&P 500 Index futures contracts expiring in March were down 0.4% as of 8:26 a.m. in Tokyo, after the attack prompted Iraq’s parliament to vote to expel U.S. troops from the country. Iran said it would no longer abide by any limits on its enrichment of uranium. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 Index slid 0.5%, while contracts on Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%.
“The risk-on tone that had continued into the new year was disrupted last week with the return of geopolitical tensions, which heightened only further over the weekend with threats exchanged between the U.S. and Iran,” said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte. “Short-term weakness in the equity space may also ensue as the market evaluates the good run we have seen so far on the likes of trade hopes.”
Geopolitical tension has been virtually the only thing capable of knocking U.S. equities off an upward march that began five months ago. The S&P 500 is coming off its best year in six, adding almost 30% in 2019. Its biggest monthly decline in the past year came in May, when the U.S.-China trade war heated up and the Trump administration put Huawei Technologies Co. on a blacklist.
Markets may be especially susceptible to shocks right now with the S&P 500 trading at almost 22 times earnings, near its bull-market peak. A valuation model from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management showed stocks are overvalued relative to the historical average when measured against earnings, long-term earnings, book value and cash flow.
Market Breather
“We have to remember that the market is coming off of a very strong rally, so it’s natural that the buyers would pull in their horns a little bit,” said Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co.
At the same time, geopolitical events like last week’s attack haven’t created lasting market disruption, according to a note Sunday from Suntrust. The firm looked at 12 comparable instances and found equities were lower 12 months later only three times, each coinciding with a recession.
“The drop in futures thus far is within Friday’s trading range,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, said via email. “Fundamentals are still pointing higher and this should keep ‘buyers on the dip’ prevalent if/when Iran tensions cause it to sell off.”"

The typical FTSE 100 boss would need to work until shortly before 5 p.m. on Jan. 6. -- a few hours longer than a year ago -- to reach the average full-time wage of just more than 29,000 pounds, according to figures from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the High Pay Centre published on Monday.
The estimate is based on the average boss earning 3.46 million pounds ($4.5 million) in 2018, the most recent available data, meaning it would take them 33 working hours to reach that year’s average U.K. salary.
The research comes as large firms listed in the country prepare for rules forcing greater transparency on what they pay their workers. Starting this year, companies with more than 250 staff will be required to report the gap in earnings between their chief executive and the typical employee.
The government on Monday cited CIPD figures showing that the average pay for top CEOs has fallen by almost a quarter since 2012.

Instead, he’s fighting the battle all over again -- this time in a court.
India’s Supreme Court is expected to hear as early as this week an appeal by the $111-billion conglomerate to quash a panel’s order that directed the Tata group to rehire the man it fired as chairman. The tycoon, 82, is personally leading the charge in the case, and filed a separate petition challenging the ruling.
In a severe blow to the Tata Group, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal said Dec. 18 that Cyrus Mistry was improperly removed in October 2016 at the behest of Ratan Tata, chairman-emeritus of the group, whose actions were “oppressive” for minority investors. Meanwhile, Mistry said that he doesn’t want to return, but will fight to protect shareholder rights.
Tata Ordered by Indian Court to Rehire Chairman It Fired
The court’s verdict has threatened to upend Ratan Tata’s 21-year legacy as chairman, when the group embarked on an unprecedented expansion, snapping up assets such as the iconic luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover and British steelmaker Corus Group Plc. After Mistry took over as the chairman in 2012, he sought to roll back some of his predecessor’s moves in a bid to pare the group’s debt, drawing Ratan Tata’s ire that eventually cost him his job.
Landmark Case
“This is a landmark case for Ratan Tata,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice-president at Mumbai-based brokerage India Infoline Ltd. “This is an ego battle and he wants to protect his legacy linked to the transformation of the Tata group.”
The legal wrangling has come as the latest challenge for the octogenarian at a time when the group is trying to find partners for JLR, whose fortunes have faded in the wake of Brexit as well as a demand slump in China and a backlash against fossil-fuel-guzzling vehicles. The purchase of Corus in 2007 added to Tata Steel Ltd.’s debt and the company is now paring its European operations by slashing thousands of jobs.
In its appeal filed on Jan. 2, Tata Sons sought an urgent hearing for a stay on the previous order, arguing it will cause chaos in the operations of its companies. “Any shadow over the management of any of these companies puts public interest in jeopardy,” the petition said. In his separate filing a day later, Ratan Tata said the lower court’s judgment is “specious, wholly erroneous and unsustainable.”
Ousted Tata Chairman Says He Doesn’t Want His Old Job Back
In a statement Sunday, Mistry, whose family owns 18% of Tata Sons, said he won’t seek to be a director on Tata’s group firms such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Tata Teleservices Ltd. or Tata Industries Ltd. Instead, the executive said he will seek to get his seat back at the board of Tata Sons.
“It is time the group’s management introspects and reflects on its conduct as it embarks on future actions,” he said.
What’s Behind the Fight Atop India’s Tata Group: QuickTake
The lower court that delivered the shock order last month had seen most of its high-profile decisions last year modified by the Supreme Court. Six of the eight major cases decided in 2019 were reversed or altered by the top court, a larger proportion than previous years.
As part of its order, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ruled that the appointment of Natarajan Chandrasekaran as chairman of Tata Sons in early 2017 was illegal. It also ordered that Tata Sons be classified again as a publicly held company, giving minority shareholders more autonomy to sell its shares.
It also restrained Tata and his representatives from taking any decision that would require a majority vote on the board of Tata Sons.
“It will be a meaningful victory for Tata only when they get a blanket stay from the apex court on the entire appeals court order,” said Ramesh K. Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner, Advaya Legal, a commercial law firm based in Mumbai. “I would see it as a setback for them if they only manage to secure a stay on Mistry’s re-induction.”
Court That Heard Tata Case Has Often Had Its Rulings Changed
Tata Sons controls and invests in the group’s major companies and oversees 28 publicly listed firms. The 152-year-old group employs 700,000 people who make cars, blend tea, forge steel, sell insurance, write software, operate phone networks and package salt among much else.
Ratan Tata, who now runs Tata Trusts that control 66% of Tata Sons, had swelled group revenues manifold in his over two decades as chairman.
“I look forward with excitement to the new decade ahead, which is a great time to be relevant, to stand for causes you believe in, to create something from scratch, make special connections, laugh, and write a little bit of history,” Ratan Tata wrote in an Instagram post on Dec. 28, on the occasion of his birthday.

Japan’s currency matched a three-month high in the wake of fallout from the U.S. killing of a top Iranian military commander in Iraq. Gold surged to the highest in more than six years and Treasury yields ticked lower. Japanese, Australian and South Korean equities fell, and U.S. futures slipped. The S&P 500 Index posted its biggest loss in a month Friday in the wake of the killing, which threatened to spur escalating violence across the Middle East.
The tensions cast a cloud over largely positive forecasts for risk assets at the start of 2020, with a U.S.-China phase-one trade deal expected to be signed later this month. Moves by China to bolster economic growth, and signs of stabilization in Chinese manufacturing, have also offered hope for a rebound in commerce.

As China cracks down on shadow finance, private companies and state giants alike are learning that the karmic wheel of money can come to a screeching halt.
In April 2018, China unveiled far-reaching rules for its financial industry as part of an effort to curb risk. Banks were asked to spin off their wealth-management arms, which had helped funnel credit to an overburdened private sector, and stick to traditional, boring (read: low-yielding) loan books. They were given three years to adopt the new rules, ending in December 2020. 
This was a declaration of war on shadow financing. The industry shrank by 1.6 trillion yuan ($229.1 billion) in 2019, after contracting by 2.9 trillion yuan a year earlier. 
The policy change has already inflicted some damage. Onshore bond defaults hit a record high for two straight years. In 2019, most of them came from private-sector borrowers struggling to refinance, while state-owned enterprises emerged largely unscathed.
As we enter 2020, however, China’s draconian reforms could start to backfire on the state, too. 
For starters, a shadow-banking crackdown has severely restricted Beijing’s fiscal prowess. To boost infrastructure spending, officials have been allowing local governments to issue special-purpose municipal bonds at a record pace, even bringing forward the quota for 2020. Yet infrastructure spending remains anemic, growing even slower than the overall economy. 
Why would this be? Since 2015, Beijing has been relying on public-private partnerships to build roads and railways. But private money has essentially evaporated after the new rules prevented wealth-management products, typically short-term instruments, from investing in longer-term projects. Meanwhile, China’s new municipal bond issues, at roughly 2 trillion yuan a year, can’t meet the nation’s annual infrastructure spending of 17 trillion yuan.
Beyond a few hiccups, faith in China’s public-sector bond issuers remained relatively unshaken in 2019. Every once in a while, a local government financing vehicle would be a few days late in its coupon repayment, but Beijing hasn't allowed these municipally run, off-balance-sheet shell companies to default. Ever. 
This may not be such a sure bet in 2020. LGFVs have amassed a huge pile of debt over the past decade: 33 trillion yuan, according to S&P Global Ratings. Of that, only about a quarter is in bonds; the rest comes in the form of bank loans and non-standard credit. In other words, private enterprises aren't the only ones dipping into the shadow-banking well. Impoverished local governments are, too.
Many of the 1,800-plus LGFVs have deep relations with shadow banks, data compiled by Huatai Securities Co. show. In Guizhou province, for example, these entities get 20% of their financing from non-standard sources of credit. In Tongren, a city in the region, that figure is 72%. This should come as no surprise: As providers of public services and infrastructure, LGFVs often struggle to generate enough cash flow, and even state-owned banks are holding back credit from the poorest areas.
As we witnessed in 2018 and 2019, private enterprises have no choice but to default when one of their key funding channels is cut off. Unless China takes a policy U-turn, the same phenomenon may repeat with municipals’ financing vehicles.
By now, the realization that banks prefer state-linked entities has become deeply ingrained in China’s business community. So how do private businesses get cheap credit? By pretending to be affiliated with the government. Already, quite a few “fakes” have blown up in investors’ faces.
China Minsheng Investment Group Corp., for example, repeatedly tested bondholders’ nerves last year. The company has managed to amass 232 billion yuan in debt in just four years, largely thanks to its status as the brainchild of Premier Li Keqiang and its pledge to serve “national strategy as its mission,” according to a 2016 bond prospectus. Yet the company remains privately held.
Or consider Peking University Founder Group, which surprised traders in December with a late bond payment. Investors have long associated the conglomerate — whose business spans finance, real estate and commodity trading — with the Ministry of Education. As a legal tussle unfolds, though, many are starting to question the strength of  Founder’s state ties. The company could be one of the biggest corporate defaults in China: It has 23 onshore notes outstanding, with two-thirds, or 24 billion yuan, due over the next year. 
Similar soap operas will continue to play out because being a fake state-owned enterprise is the only way to get good credit. And Beijing will have no choice but to step in, or risk its own reputation. 
What’s missing in all this is why China’s biggest state-owned banks aren’t filling the void. One explanation is that they have little incentive. These lenders have remained profitable, with the big four earning almost 1 trillion yuan in net profit in the last year. Lending to private businesses requires grunt work, and credit officers simply aren't interested. They’d rather write loans to state giants such as China Mobile Ltd. and go back into hibernation.
Meanwhile, Beijing has tweaked its credit statistics to appear friendlier to private businesses, all while lecturing China Inc. that allowing some defaults will help borrowers kick their debt addictions. While such advice is easy to dole out, it makes for bitter medicine when trouble starts brewing within state-run businesses. So, junk bond traders, rejoice! Those defaults you fear could dwindle in 2020. China’s war on shadow banking can’t last forever. "
820,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 05:31PM ET</span>",Musk’s Moment of Truth Arrives With Made-in-China Teslas,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk’s decision to assemble Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. cars in China required years of planning and billions of dollars in spending. Now comes the challenging part.
The electric Model 3 sedans rolling off the assembly line at Tesla’s Shanghai plant — its first outside the U.S. — face a market where total vehicle sales are expected to fall for a third straight year. After capturing about 5% of China’s car sales, electric vehicles have been losing steam as the economy cooled and the government scaled back subsidies for buyers.
That could spell trouble for a launch that investors are watching closely for evidence that Tesla has what it takes to go global. A slow start for sales of its made-in-China cars would put more pressure on the unprofitable manufacturer’s finances, giving Musk little room for missteps to support a stock that’s hovering at an all-time high.
“Tesla is rushing to start deliveries before other global brands bring in more EVs,” said Zhang Yan, an analyst at research firm LMC Automotive in Shanghai. “It’s an attempt to conquer the market.”
EV sales plunged 42% in China in November as the government handouts that lowered sticker prices receded significantly. That means Musk and his team are looking at a market that’s very different from mid-2018, when the decision to build a Shanghai plant was announced. Back then, the industry’s sales were growing at a roughly 100% clip.
The tough market could mean that Tesla sells just 21,000 China-built Model 3s this year, according to LMC Automotive. That would qualify as a sluggish start given the Shanghai facility already builds more than 1,000 cars a week and plans to double production during the next year.
The forecast takes into account Tesla’s history of production delays, potential supply-chain constraints and the complexity of manufacturing high-quality cars at scale, LMC Automotive said.
Yet others are more optimistic. Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight, said Tesla could sell about 100,000 Model 3 cars. Wang Lei, a Shanghai-based analyst for China International Capital Corp., said Tesla could sell a combined 120,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.
Given Tesla’s volatile share price, investors will be hyperfocused on the Shanghai ramp-up.
Success in boosting China sales could propel Tesla to as high as $500 a share, a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst, Adam Jonas, said in a December note to clients. Tesla climbed to a record $443.01 on Friday after rising 26% last year. Analysts expect the stock to fetch $311.41 in 12 months, based on 31 target prices compiled by Bloomberg.
So far, the China project has gone smoothly. Musk’s visits helped the company get preferential bank loans and swift approvals for construction and manufacturing. And while the subsidies are being phased out, the locally built Model 3 still qualified for a sizable handout of as much as about $3,550 per car.
But success requires winning over the consumer. A majority of China’s EV purchases — about 70%, according to Sanford C. Bernstein — so far have been to the government and “policy-direct” customers, including taxis, mobility services and other government-affiliated fleet operators. Such buyers typically forgo premium cars like Teslas in favor of cheaper, local models.
“It’s a distorted need,” said Robin Zhu, an analyst with Bernstein. “And the market won’t change much in the next two-to-three years.”
Cars that cost less than 100,000 yuan ($14,300) make up more than half of EV sales in China, according to Bernstein. Tesla last week cut the starting price of the Model 3 to 323,800 yuan from 355,800 yuan -- a 9% reduction. Subsidies lower the starting price to 299,050 yuan.
“To paraphrase Elon Musk, demand may be insanely high, but people literally cannot afford to buy them,” Zhu said.
To be sure, there is a segment of China’s massive population that can afford Teslas. But the Palo Alto, California-based company won’t be the sole global EV brand targeting those buyers.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s Audi plans to start selling nine new-energy-vehicle models in China during the next two years, with more than half of them being pure battery-electric. The first electric model, the E-Tron, debuted in November at a starting price of about 693,000 yuan.
Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz EQC electric model became available in October and starts at 580,000 yuan. BMW AG plans to start building the iX3 crossover in China next year and is working with a Chinese partner to electrify its Mini model.
There also is a slew of local upstarts targeting the premium segment. Electric SUVs from NIO Inc. and Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors Technology Co., or Xpeng Motors, are priced aggressively and already have found fans.
“It will be challenging for carmakers to differentiate themselves and be competitive,” said Stephen Dyer, managing director at Alixpartners, a global consulting firm.
Tesla, a pioneer in electric cars, probably will have an edge for the next one-to-two years before competition starts catching up, said David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. Tesla’s vehicles have an industry-leading driving range to go along with the brand appeal.
Boding well for the company, registrations of Tesla vehicles in China rose 14-fold to 5,597 in November. While growing from a low base, the figure suggests healthy demand for its cars even though all the models available thus far have been the pricier imported versions of the Model 3, and the higher-end Model S sedan and Model X SUV.
Tesla also doesn’t have to worry about selling traditional internal-combustion vehicles. Its global rivals operate expensive gas-guzzler plants in China and need to make sure their new EVs aren’t cannibalizing more profitable gasoline-powered lineups.
“Other multinationals, carrying the legacy of traditional automakers, came into the market reluctantly and lately. They are jumping in the pool they never wanted to swim in,“ said Bill Russo, chief executive officer of consulting firm Automobility Ltd. in Shanghai. “Tesla is not a conflicted company. They don’t have to choose.

821,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 05:01PM ET</span>",Aussie’s Christmas Revival Punishes Funds Who Just Went Short,"(Bloomberg) -- The Aussie dollar’s surge in December made it a Christmas to forget for funds who had gone short. They will be hoping key data this week help send the currency back down.
The Aussie rocketed 3.8% last month, its biggest gain in more than two years, as the U.S. and China reached an initial trade deal. The announcement boosted risk assets across the world, and especially the currency of Australia, which counts China as its largest trading partner.
The rally saw the Aussie climb above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages in the space of just two weeks, the latter being surpassed for the first time since April. The currency eventually peaked at a five-month high of 70.32 U.S. cents on New Year’s Eve before pulling back toward the end of last week.
The timing of the Aussie’s revival was particularly unfortunate for leveraged funds. After trimming short positions from September to December, they flipped back to a bearish posture in the week ending Dec. 17. That switch coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement that a trade truce had been agreed with China.
Still, all may not be lost for the bears.
A big hurdle awaits the Aussie in the form of November retail-sales data due Friday. Sales growth has hovered around zero in recent months, averaging a measly 0.2% through the first 10 months of 2019. While economists are tipping a modest improvement to 0.4%, a miss may be particularly damaging as Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said last month he was still confident of a pickup in consumption.
There’s plenty of room for traders to ratchet up bets on an interest-rate cut in February given the odds are currently just 48%. If the retail-sales numbers disappoint, Aussie bears will be looking for the currency to fall back to at least its 200-DMA, which was at 68.99 cents late on Friday.
Technical indicators also suggest the Aussie may be due for a more extensive pullback. The Aussie-U.S. dollar pair’s slow stochastics, an indicator of momentum, is now in overbought territory. This indicates another move lower may be just around the corner.

822,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 03:52PM ET</span>","Boeing, FAA reviewing wiring issue on grounded 737 MAX","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed on Sunday they are reviewing a wiring issue that could potentially cause a short circuit on the grounded 737 MAX.
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Sunday the U.S. planemaker ""identified this issue as part of that rigorous process, and we are working with the FAA to perform the appropriate analysis. It would be premature to speculate as to whether this analysis will lead to any design changes.""
The New York Times reported Boeing is reviewing whether two bundles of wiring are too close together, which could lead to a short circuit and potentially result in a crash if pilots did not respond appropriately.
The FAA said in a statement Sunday the agency and company ""are analyzing certain findings from a recent review of the proposed modifications to the Boeing 737 MAX."" The agency added it will ""ensure that all safety related issues identified during this process are addressed.""
Boeing is currently working to design separating the wiring bundles if necessary and conducting extensive analysis to establish if the electrical fault could occur in a real-world scenario, a company official said.
Officials said the FAA had directed Boeing to complete an audit in December. The wiring issue could push back the return of the MAX, the officials added. Reuters has reported previously the FAA is not likely to approve the plane until at least February and might not until March or later.
The FAA flagged the wiring issue as potentially ""catastrophic."" It is possible other protections like shielding, insulation and circuit breakers could prevent the short circuit, a company official said.
Boeing will halt production of the 737 MAX this month following the grounding in March of its best-selling plane after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people.
Last month, Boeing's board fired Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg after repeatedly failing to contain the fallout from the crashes that tarnished its reputation with airlines and regulators.
The crisis has cost Boeing $9 billion, and has hurt suppliers and airlines.
Boeing is struggling to mend relations with the U.S. and international regulators it needs to win over to get the jet back in the air.
Separately, U.S. and European regulators are expected to return to Iowa this week to review a software documentation audit of the 737 MAX that was not completed last year, officials said Sunday. FAA and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency are scheduled to meet in Seattle this week and then return to Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa next weekend to review the audit."

Japan’s currency appreciated for a third-straight day as markets opened in Sydney, while the Australian dollar weakened.
All the Middle East’s major equity gauges fell Sunday. Kuwait’s dropped more than 4%, trimming a rally that made it the best market in the region last year.  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) slumped as the country’s Tadawul All Share Index lost as much 2.5%. Egypt’s EGX30 gauge fell 4.4%, the most since September, and stocks in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Israel and Oman also weakened.
Geopolitical risks flared after Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was killed in Iraq last week in a drone attack ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani vowed revenge, while Trump said late Saturday the U.S. had identified 52 Iranian sites that would be hit “very hard” if Tehran retaliated. Iran also said it would no longer abide by any limits on its enrichment of uranium, while Iraq’s parliament voted to expel U.S. troops from the country.
“Investors who were hoping for lower geopolitical tension in the Middle East and North Africa in 2020 got their hopes dashed on the second day of the year,” said Mohammed Ali Yasin, chief strategy officer at Abu Dhabi-based Al Dhabi Capital Ltd. “2020 will continue to be a year of high geopolitical tensions.”
Happening Again
Global markets turned sour Friday as Soleimani’s death triggered a flight to havens at the expense of riskier assets. MSCI Inc.’s index of emerging-market stocks fell the most in more than a month. Brent crude rose to $68.60 a barrel, its highest level since mid-September, and gold, a haven for investors in rocky markets, almost reached a six-year high.
As markets reopened Monday, the yen appreciated 0.2% to touch 107.84 per dollar, matching Friday’s level that was the strongest since Oct. 10. The Aussie dollar slipped 0.2% to 69.37 U.S. cents.
Reaction to Iran Strike Masks Uncertainties: Mohamed A. El-Erian
The cost of insuring Saudi Arabia’s debt against default spiked. The country’s five-year credit default swaps are now more expensive than Indonesia’s for the first time in almost two years, even though Moody’s Investors Service rates the latter four levels lower. Yields on the bonds of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Lebanon and Iraq all climbed.
Aramco shares may be in the grips of their biggest test since the initial public offering less than a month ago. The stock dropped 1.7% Sunday to 34.55 riyals, their lowest closing level since the Dec. 11 listing.
Optimists will point to the resilience of financial markets in the face of political tension. Volatility surged in September after drone strikes against Aramco facilities highlighted the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia’s oil installations. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who’ve launched several drone attacks on Saudi targets in the past, claimed responsibility.
That came just a few months after a spate of attacks on oil tankers in or near the Strait of Hormuz, for which the U.S. and Saudi governments blamed Iran.
The extent of the latest sell-off will depend on if, how and when Iran responds to Soleimani’s killing, said Fahd Iqbal,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) AG’s Dubai-based head of Middle East Research.“There will be a sense of nervousness and wait-and-see,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Sunday. “There is a lack of knowing what Iran is going to do, or how severe any kind of retaliation will be, if there is any.”

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe will start another round of discussions with union representatives on Tuesday, which will mark the 34th consecutive day of strikes at state-owned railway company SNCF.
“I expect Edouard Philippe’s government to find a route to a quick compromise that respects the principles I have repeated,” Macron said during his New Year speech last week. “The pension reform I have committed to will be completed.”
Macron has already made unpopular changes to taxes, labor laws and the welfare system, but the pension reform is proving the most challenging for the French president. The labor unrest has already run longer than the 1995 strikes that forced the government to back off from changing the state system for retirement and health care.
The potential damage to the French economy is adding urgency to the talks as growth could be hampered if strikes drag on, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire signaled in an interview with the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday. The economy will grow 1.3% this year, the same pace as 2019, as long as a compromise with labor unions is reached quickly.
The strike has curtailed public transportation for the past month and dented the hospitality industry’s revenue, but it’s not too late to stem the damage, he said.
“There’s a time to make your opposition known, and there’s a time to find a compromise. That time has come.” Unions should accept Philippe’s offer to negotiate so that this week’s talks can end the standoff, Le Maire said.
There were some signs that the momentum of strikes may be starting to wane as metro and railway services around Paris improved slightly, while SNCF announced that speed train operations should be back to almost normal as soon as Monday, with significant improvement for other trains.
Further, a survey conducted Thursday and Friday by pollster Ifop and published on Sunday found that 44% support the strikers, down from 51% just before Christmas. The latest results found 37% opposed to the protests and 19% were indifferent.
Unions are still aiming to step up the demonstrations again as the holiday season ends with calls for a fourth day of nationwide protests on Jan. 9 and a fifth on Jan. 11. The far-left CGT union is pushing to escalate the demonstrations, calling for a complete blockade of the country’s refineries from Jan. 7 until Jan. 10.
The movement has coalesced discontent from all sides with opposition parties, from the far-right National Rally to EELV, the environmental party, also calling for the government to spike the reform."

827,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 12:31PM ET</span>",Give Up Facebook for a Month and Help Economists Fix GDP,"(Bloomberg) -- Would you give up Facebook for one month in exchange for $50?
The question, posed by MIT’s Erik Brynjolfsson and four co-authors of a new paper, may help economists get a better measure of the extent to which new, free technologies are reshaping the economy and our lives. The answer, unsurprisingly, is a lot.
They estimate that the social network by itself could add as much as 0.11 percentage points annually to U.S. gross domestic product if measured by its benefit to users. The paper was presented Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in San Diego.
The paper gets at a broader question facing economists: How much is technology improving our lives? Traditionally, they’ve addressed that question by asking how much richer various innovations have made us. Thus the answer would show up in GDP, an imperfect but reasonable measure of aggregate welfare.
That task gets harder, however, when the technologies transforming society are free, at least in dollar terms, though the authors also nod to the idea that “free” goods and services can come at an implicit price.
After all, if Facebook, Twitter, GPS map services and a host of other apps on your smart phone come at zero cost, then they won’t show up in GDP, nor in traditional measures of productivity -- even if they improve our lives and make us more productive.
To solve this, Brynjolfsson and his co-authors first conducted a set of experiments and surveys aimed at teasing out the monetary value people assign to certain free goods and services. This allows them to construct an alternative to GDP, which they call GDP-B, based not on actual costs but on perceived benefits.
Among a representative sample of U.S. internet users, they found the median price of giving up Facebook for a month was $42.17.
Among a separate group of test subjects in the Netherlands, asked about a handful of free internet-based services, the group assigned the highest value to WhatsApp, owned by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., at a staggering 535.73 euros ($598) for just one month’s abstinence. Facebook was next highest at around 100 euros. Twitter, used by just a third of the group, was valued at less than 1 euro.
“GDP-B and the related metrics proposed in this paper enable a more thorough exploration of the impacts of new and free goods on welfare, with significant potential policy implications,” the authors concluded.
For starters, they said, the implied adjustments to GDP “may go some way to explaining the much documented and debated productivity growth slowdown experienced by industrialized countries since 2004.”"

""I will not be pursuing the executive chairmanship of Tata Sons, or directorship of TCS ( Tata Consultancy Services ), Tata Teleservices or Tata Industries,"" he said in a statement.
Mistry was sacked in 2016 from the top job at the helm of the holding company after he fell out with group patriarch Ratan Tata over corporate governance issues at Tata group companies.
Since then he has been embroiled in a legal battle claiming minority shareholder oppression and mismanagement. Mistry's family owns a sizable minority stake in Tata Sons, the group's parent entity.
Mistry said his company, the diversified Shapoorji Pallonji group, would seek to appoint a member on the board of Tata Sons.
""I will however vigorously pursue all options to protect our rights as a minority shareholder, including that of resuming the 30-year history of a seat at the Board of Tata Sons,"" he said.
The December order by National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) called the appointment of N Chandrasekaran, after Mistry's removal, illegal and also asked Ratan Tata not to interfere with matters of the company.
Tata Sons appealed the NCLAT ruling in the Supreme Court this week. A handful of Tata group companies, including its crown jewel Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (NS:TCS), have also appealed the decision.
""As an 18.37% shareholder, it is in our own interest to ensure the group's long-term success,"" Mistry said.

The Chinese delegation will return on Jan. 16, SCMP said https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3044741/trade-war-chinese-put-back-visit-sign-truce-after-donald.
The trade delegation, led by Vice Premier Liu He, had originally planned to set off earlier in the month but had to change plans after U.S. President Donald Trump sent a tweet https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1212014713808273410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1212014713808273410&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scmp.com%2Feconomy%2Fchina-economy%2Farticle%2F3044741%2Ftrade-war-chinese-put-back-visit-sign-truce-after-donald claiming that he would sign the Phase 1 trade deal with China on Jan. 15.
After a full afternoon's discussion, the Chinese side decided to revise their plan to accommodate Trump, SCMP said.
Washington and Beijing have yet to officially confirm Liu's visit.
Trump had first announced plans for the initial trade pact in October, and U.S. and Chinese negotiators spent weeks finalizing the Phase 1 deal, which comes in lieu of the massive trade agreement that the world's two largest economies had initially sought.

The Automobilwoche weekly cited a Volvo manager as saying there were initial talks with Daimler, but no concrete plans, while a company spokesman said it was too early to talk about firm projects, although it was not excluding anybody.
A Daimler spokesman said the company's cooperation with Geely, which owns a 10% stake in the German carmaker, was developing in a positive way, but declined to comment further.
Global tariffs, accelerated by a trade war between China and the United States, as well as higher investment requirements for electric and autonomous vehicles, are forcing carmakers to seek new ways to cut and share costs.
In October, Volvo said it would merge its engine development and manufacturing assets with those of Geely, creating a division to supply in-house brands and also potentially others with next-generation combustion and hybrid engines.
The Automobilwoche said this new division would start operating by the end of March, which could be a possible starting point for cooperation with Daimler, while a further step could be a partnership to develop electric power trains.
Geely and Daimler have said they plan to build the next generation of Smart electric cars in China through a joint venture and the two companies are also cooperating on a premium ride-hailing service in China.
Geely bought Volvo Cars in 2010 from  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), allowing the Swedish brand to operate on an arms-length basis. But in recent years, it has deepened cooperation between the two brands.
Volvo already supplies engines to some Geely-branded vehicles, sharing technology through Geely's Lynk brand. Both companies share and develop common vehicle platforms."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German automaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) said on Saturday it will recall 744,000 Mercedes-Benz vehicles in the United States from the 2001 through 2011 model years because the sunroof glass panel could detach and pose a hazard.
The large recall covers more two dozen vehicles from C-Class, CLK-Class, CLS-Class and E-Class model lines. The automaker said the bonding between the glass panel and the sliding room frame might not meet specifications and could lead to sunroofs detaching.
Owners who paid for repairs for the issue will be able to seek reimbursements from Daimler. A Mercedes-Benz USA spokesman said on Saturday he did not have a worldwide vehicle total for the recall.
Dealers will inspect the glass panel bonding and replace the sliding roof if necessary, the company said. 
Last month, Mercedes-Benz USA agreed to a $20 million civil penalty over its handling of U.S. vehicle recalls after a year-long U.S. government investigation into 1.4 million recalled vehicles.

Under the terms of the settlement, the automaker will pay $13 million and faces another $7 million fine if it does not comply with the agreement. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the company failed to notify owners in a timely fashion in some recalls, did not submit all reports and did not launch at least two recalls in a timely fashion.

Atlantia has come under fire after the collapse of a concrete bridge operated by its Autostrade per l'Italia unit killed 43 people in the port city of Genoa in August 2018.
The group, controlled by Italy's Benetton family, manages the country's biggest toll-road network, spanning 3,000 km.
The Rome government is considering revoking Autostrade's motorway license and recently passed measures that reduce compensation owed for the early termination of a contract if the concession holder is in breach of its obligations.
""With the revocation and a reduced payout we risk going bankrupt because we have outstanding credit lines worth 10.5 billion euros,"" Atlantia CEO Roberto Tomasi told Corriere della Sera in an interview.
Late on Friday, credit rating agency Moody's downgraded Atlantia for the second time in a month, pushing its debt further below the investment grade threshold.
""We need an accord that brings together public interest, the rights of those in business and the rule of law. Such an accord is possible and must be reached in the interest of (Atlantia's) 7,000 workers, all stakeholders and Italians in general,"" Tomasi said.
He declined to comment on a Corriere report saying Atlantia had proposed to the transport ministry to pay some 2 billion euros to rebuild the Genoa bridge, compensate the city and fund fresh investments, but had rejected a request to cut tolls by 5% in coming years.
""All I can say is that we're ready to continue discussions with the government to avoid destroying a piece of the country's industrial heritage,"" he said.
After an emergency meeting called this week when parts of the roof of a highway tunnel managed by Autostrade fell off, the transport ministry announced a freeze of highway tolls for 2020.
Tomasi said Atlantia was ready to discuss a toll system that tied hikes to investments carried out and not simply planned.
Motorway operators have appealed against such a system put forward by Italy's transportation authority. The government, however, has moved to block tariff increases until operators adopt new plans that conform to the new system.
Tomasi said Atlantia would present a new business plan to 2023 in January with a focus on research and development, new management models and digitalization."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn left his Tokyo residence after a private security firm hired by Nissan Motor Co stopped monitoring him, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday.
Ghosn has become an international fugitive after he revealed on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, where he faces charges relating to alleged financial crimes.
Nissan had hired a private security company to watch Ghosn, who was on bail and awaiting trial, to check whether he met any people involved in the case, the three sources said.
But his lawyers warned the security company to stop watching him as it would be a violation of his human rights, and Ghosn was planning to file a complaint against the company, the sources said. 
The security company stopped its surveillance by Dec. 29, the sources said.
One of his lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters in November that they were considering steps to prevent people from stalking Ghosn. 
A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK, citing investigative sources, said a surveillance camera placed by the authorities in Ghosn's home showed him leaving alone around noon on Sunday, and did not show him returning.
It is unclear how Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to orchestrate his departure from Japan. He entered Lebanon legally on a French passport, one source has told Reuters.
A Turkish private jet operator said on Friday that Ghosn used two of its planes illegally in his escape from Japan, with an employee falsifying lease records to exclude his name from the documents.
Ghosn has said he will speak publicly about his escape on Jan. 8.
Takashi Takano, who is also one of Ghosn's lawyers, wrote in his blog on Saturday that he felt infuriated and betrayed when he found out about Ghosn's escape from Japan but that he felt some understanding. 
""I was betrayed. But it is not Carlos Ghosn who betrayed me,"" he wrote in his blog. 
Takano said Ghosn was not allowed to communicate with his wife Carole without permission and the ex-Nissan boss was also concerned about his chances of getting a fair trial.
On Dec. 24, Ghosn and his wife held a one-hour video call, which required a lawyer's presence, and they talked about their children, relatives and friends, Takano wrote. Takano was present during the video call.
Few people would have been able to escape as Ghosn did, but if they had the means and contacts, they certainly might try or at least consider trying, Takano wrote. 

Ghosn was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018, shortly after his private jet touched down at the airport. He faces four charges - which he denies - including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.

Of the 79 metropolitan areas covered by Reis, 24 showed an increase in vacancies in the quarter.
""Office occupancy growth was much stronger in the fourth quarter; however, three metros saw the lion's share of the growth: Chicago, New York and Dallas,"" according to the report.
New construction of office spaces fell to 12.5 million square feet from 14.7 million square feet a year earlier.
The research firm, however, flagged concerns about office-space sharing company WeWork's occupancies as the company over-expanded and may need to reconsider some of its office leases, which could raise vacancies in a few metros.
WeWork's woes and escalating geopolitical tensions following the U.S. strike in the Middle East could hurt the office market, Reis said.
Iran promised vengeance after a U.S. air strike in Baghdad on Friday killed Qassem Soleimani, Tehran's most prominent military commander and the architect of its growing influence in the Middle East.
Reis said net absorption, measured in terms of available office space sold in the market during a certain time period, rose 21% to 12.2 million square feet of office space in the quarter.
The average asking and effective rents rose 2.6% and 2.7%, respectively, from a year earlier.
""Job growth should stay positive in 2020 and continue to support occupancy growth in the office sector at a similarly tepid pace as in 2019,"" Reis said."
843,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 07:51PM ET</span>",Police body camera maker Axon sues U.S. FTC over antitrust litigation,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Axon Enterprise Inc (O:AAXN) on Friday sued the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in a bid to have antitrust proceedings over an acquisition heard in a federal court and not in an internal FTC process, claiming that the FTC's ability to both prosecute and judge cases deprives companies of their constitutional rights.
Axon, the manufacturer of Taser stun guns and body camera systems for police departments, said in its complaint that it has been cooperating with an FTC probe of its acquisition of Vievu for more than 18 months. Vievu was a smaller player in the market for body cameras and online storage and management of the footage they generate. 
In the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Arizona, Axon denied that the Vievu deal was anticompetitive and said it ""is eager to prove its case in any federal court in this country.
""But Axon cannot - and will not - accept the FTC’s attempts to extort an irrational 'settlement' through a biased adjudicative process that vests the Commission with the powers of prosecutor, judge, and jury in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection guarantees of the U.S. Constitution."" it said.
Last month, Axon alleges, FTC officials told the company it would have to unwind the Vievu acquisition by divesting the assets and offering patent licenses to any potential acquirer.
According to Axon, in a December 2019 face-to-face meeting with its attorney, the FTC threatened to start an internal administrative law proceeding this month to unwind the Vievu deal if Axon would not agree to the settlement.
The FTC, in an administrative complaint filed late Friday afternoon, said the Vievu deal had reduced competition in the market for supplying body cameras to large police departments. 
""The Commission is taking action to ensure that police officers have access to the cutting-edge products they need to do their job, and police departments benefit from the lower prices and innovative products that competition had provided before the acquisition,"" Ian Conner, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.
Axon Chief Executive Rick Smith responded that the company would stand by its effort to block an ""unconstitutional” administrative process with the FTC.
The FTC can choose to file antitrust actions either in a federal court or via an internal administrative law procedure.
Axon alleges that FTC's internal administrative proceedings are unfair because they can only be appealed to the full FTC commission. While an FTC decision can be appealed to a federal appeals court, no new facts or evidence can be introduced, making it harder to overturn the case, Axon argued.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 07:22PM ET</span>",Your Money: Ditch the Resolution - Do a year-end review instead,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK(Reuters) - It is hardly a secret that people rarely stick to New Year's resolutions - only about 8% of people actually make it to the finish line with their goals, according to studies from the University of Scranton, in Pennsylvania.
So here is a better idea for your financial life: Before you look forward, look backward.
A year-end spending review is a far superior way to revamp your financial life. Instead of gauzy, improbable thinking about what you might do, you face the cold, hard truth about what you actually did.
“We can only manage what we measure,” said Sarah Newcomb, director of behavioral science at fund research firm Morningstar. “If you're not even measuring your own spending, then basically you're just flying blind.”
This is especially true for the holiday season, when money seems to exit our wallets at hyperspeed. Average holiday spending on gifts and travel was slated to exceed $1,000 apiece for 2019, according to the National Retail Federation. In fact, among those who took out holiday debt in 2018, 35% of us were still trying to pay it off this past fall, according to personal finance site NerdWallet.com.
“Use a big event like the end of the year as a catalyst to do something you should be doing on a regular basis,"" said Dan Egan, director of behavioral finance and investing at Betterment.com.
If you have not been tracking your dollars, it can seem a daunting task. A few ideas on how to figure out where all that money went in 2019 – and how to do better in 2020:
* Open that annual credit-card statement
In the New Year, credit-card companies send out roundups of everything you have purchased in 2019. Typically, you might just ignore it. Don't.
For one thing, the documents are useful for tax planning, since purchases are often divided into spending categories that can help identify deductions. They are also excellent for shock value, to force yourself to see how your cash was deployed.
If an entire year of spending is too overwhelming to digest, break that survey period into something smaller, like two months, advised Egan.
You can also focus on specific pain points, like pulling up your Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) purchase history for 2019. Shocked yet?
“Take an honest look at what your life is costing you,” Newcomb said. “If some of those costs are frivolous and are purchases you regret, that is a valuable thing to take away.”
* Put fintech apps to work
A typical excuse for those who do not keep track of spending: It is too complicated and confusing. But with all the fintech apps now available, that excuse does not really wash.
“We encourage our clients to check their ‘You Need A Budget’ app every morning over a cup of coffee,” said Brenna Baucum, a financial planner in Salem, Oregon. “It takes only one or two minutes to sort their latest transactions. Then, after 30 days, they have some handle on where their money goes. Most often, the results shock them.”
Mint.com is a popular app and one game-changer, according to financial planner Salim Boutagy of Westport, Connecticut, is its ""Trends” section, where you can see how your spending has shifted over the last few months or years.
* Calculate the unknown
In performing an annual spending review, one thing will probably jump out at you: The sheer volume of expenses that were totally unplanned and unforeseen.
“We’re all pretty good at estimating common expenses like electricity and phone and internet access,” said Morningstar's Newcomb. “But we are very bad at predicting the size and frequency of exceptions.”
That might mean car repair, or home improvements, or medical bills, or last-minute vacations. When you see how much of 2019’s spending was a total surprise, then you can build a similar buffer into next year’s budget.
Once you have done your spending X-ray for 2019, it is time to rework what Betterment’s Egan calls your “Top-Down Budgeting.” That means setting broad guidelines – like committing to saving a specific amount every month.

“The point is not to be as austere as possible and deprive yourself of all joy,” Egan said. “The point is to get to a right balance.”

(Reuters) - Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and courier services provider Postmates Inc asked a U.S. court to block a California labor law set to go into effect on Wednesday, arguing the bill violates the U.S. Constitution.
In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles federal court on Monday, the companies and two app-based drivers said the law, which would make it harder for gig economy companies to qualify their workers as independent contractors rather than employees, was irrational, vague and incoherent.
The office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Monday it was reviewing the complaint. The bill, called AB5, faces multiple legal challenges.
The law was signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom in September and has garnered national attention, largely owing to the size of California's workforce and the state's leadership role in establishing policies that are frequently adopted by other states.
Backers of the bill, including labor groups, have argued the law protects workers' rights. By classifying the contractors as employees, the companies would be subject to labor laws that require higher pay and other benefits such as medical insurance. 
The bill strikes at the heart of the ""gig economy"" business model of technology platforms like Uber, Postmates,  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), DoorDash and others who rely heavily on the state's 450,000 contract workers, not full-time employees, to drive passengers or deliver food via app-based services. 
Uber, Postmates and other app-based companies said the legislation compromises the flexibility prized by their workforce, and that fewer workers would be hired were they considered employees.
The companies in their Monday lawsuit called AB5 a ""thinly veiled attempt"" to target and harm gig economy businesses. Singling out app-based workers violates equal protection guaranteed under the constitutions of the United States and California, the companies argued.
""It irreparably harms network companies and app-based independent service providers by denying their constitutional rights to be treated the same as others to whom they are similarly situated,"" the lawsuit said. 
The companies pointed to allegedly arbitrary exemptions of different non-gig worker groups, including salespeople, travel agents, construction truck drivers and commercial fishermen.
The full impact of the bill remains unclear in the short term, but the lawsuit cited a study saying the bill would increase ride-hailing company Lyft's operating costs by 20% and lead to some 300,000 fewer drivers in California.
Ron Herrera, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 396 and Teamsters International vice president, said in a statement late on Monday night, that the labour union objects the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of AB-5. 
""Teamsters Local 396 and the broader American Labor Movement must use all of the resources at our disposal to ensure that AB-5 is protected and that workers have a voice at the table,"" Herrera added. 

Uber, Lyft and food delivery company DoorDash have earmarked $90 million for a planned November 2020 ballot initiative that would exempt them from the law.

Netflix said on Monday that science fiction series “Stranger Things” came in second, followed by the Michael Bay action movie ""6 Underground."" The animated movie ""Incredibles 2"" and Martin Scorsese's gangster film ""The Irishman"" took the fourth and fifth spots, respectively.
The ranking was based on the number of households watching at least two minutes of a series, movie or special during its first 28 days on Netflix in 2019, the streaming service said.
British royal series ""The Crown,"" whose first two seasons cost a reported $130 million to make, did not appear in the top 10 list for either the U.S. or the UK or Canada despite having won major awards, including for its leading actors. Season 3 was released in November and Netflix did not supply any viewing data.
Netflix, which boasts more than 158 million subscribers around the world, only selectively releases viewership figures for programming it considers a hit, and the numbers are not verified by a third party. 
Executives at Netflix have said they plan to be more transparent with audience data to satisfy Hollywood producers and stars and to help viewers decide what to watch.
The limited details on what grabbed Netflix viewers' attention this year came ahead of the company's Jan. 21 quarterly earnings report, which will disclose revenue and membership by region for the first time.
The streaming heavyweight is facing new competition, particularly from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, which has been removing its movies from Netflix and putting them on the Disney+ streaming service.
Netflix shares have risen 23% this year, the smallest annual rise in three years. The S&P 500 Index is up 29% for the year.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp's (N:XOM) fourth quarter operating results will decline from a year ago due to weakness in chemicals and refining, according to a regulatory filing and analyst comments on Friday.
Some analysts slashed earnings projections to about 50 cents per share, down from the average earlier estimate of 71 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES. The estimates exclude gains from asset sales.
Exxon on Friday provided its expectations for fourth-quarter results compared with the prior quarter. It will officially report results for the latest quarter on Jan. 31.
The update ""is like Groundhog's day - once again chemicals and downstream weakness will drag down overall earnings,"" said Jennifer Rowland, analyst at Edward Jones.
Exxon in the filing projected a loss in chemicals and a sharply lower operating profit in refining, two of its three major businesses. The company earned about $1 billion per quarter in chemicals as recently as 2017.
Operating profit in its largest business, oil and gas production, could be $2.3 billion based on the midpoint of its estimate, up from the third quarter but down from a year ago, according to the filing.
Offsetting the weak results, Exxon will report a gain of as much as $3.6 billion from the sale of its Norwegian oil and gas production, part of a plan to divest about $15 billion in assets by 2021.
""The asset sale proceeds will help cover the dividend, but that's not a sustainable strategy,"" Rowland said.
Exxon did not disclose any asset impairments or write downs in its filing. Since October, rivals Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa),  Chevron  (N:CVX),  BP  (L:BP), Equinor and Spain's Repsol (MC:REP) all wrote down a total more than $20 billion, primarily in U.S. shale gas assets due to lower long-term gas prices.
Cowen & Co cut its quarterly earnings estimate for Exxon to 49 cents per share from 71 cents. Simmons Energy lowered its estimate to 52 cents from 78 cents.
Exxon's refining and chemicals businesses ""remain a material headwind to cash flow"" as there is no sign it will slow spending on new investments, Simmons Energy said in a note to clients."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Novartis AG, Merck & Co Inc and Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc were among companies that raised U.S. prices on more than 100 prescription medicines on Friday, bringing the tally to 445 drugs that will cost more in 2020, according to data analyzed by healthcare research firm 3 Axis Advisors. 
That is above the average of 404 drug price increases in the first three days of January over the past five years. Nearly all of the price increases are below 10%, with the median price increase around 5%, according to 3 Axis.
Swiss drugmaker Novartis raised prices on nearly 30 drugs including psoriasis treatment Cosentyx and multiple sclerosis medicine Gilenya, 3 Axis said. Most of those increases were in the range of 5.5% to 7%.
Novartis said that while it is raising the list prices of about 7 percent of its U.S. medicines, after discounts and rebates to commercial and government payers it expects a net price decrease of 2.5% in 2020. 
U.S. drugmaker Merck raised prices on about 15 drugs, including diabetes medicines Januvia and Janumet, mostly around 5%, 3 Axis said. 
The list price of its top-selling cancer immunotherapy Keytruda, expected to tally more than $13 billion in 2019 sales, was pushed up 1.5%.
Merck in a statement said the increases are consistent with its commitment to not raise U.S. net prices by more than inflation annually.
Ireland-based Allergan, which is being acquired by rival  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) for more than $60 billion, said it was raising prices on 25 drugs by 5% and on two more medicines by 2-3%. But with higher rebates and discounts, it said, net pricing would be flat to lower in 2020.
Reuters previously reported that  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co and AbbVie were among drugmakers that had raised prices on more than 330 drugs to start the year.
Soaring healthcare costs for U.S. consumers, and prescription drug prices in particular, are expected to again be a central issue in the 2020 presidential campaign for both parties. President Donald Trump, a Republican who made bringing them down a core pledge of his 2016 campaign, is running for re-election in 2020.
Under pressure from politicians and patients, many makers of branded drugs have pledged to keep annual U.S. price increases below 10% a year. 
Prescription drug prices are higher in the United States than most developed countries where governments directly or indirectly control the costs, making it the world's most lucrative market for manufacturers.

Drugmakers often negotiate rebates or discounts on their list prices in exchange for favorable treatment from insurers and other healthcare payers. As a result, insurers and covered patients rarely pay the full list price of a drug.

(Reuters) - U.S. automakers on Friday reported another year of stable sales of pick-up trucks, as discounts during the crucial holiday season and lower interest rates on vehicle loans attracted buyers while demand for passenger cars retreated further.
Passenger cars have fallen out of favor with buyers amid lower oil prices and automakers have focused on selling larger sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pick-ups that are also more profitable.
December is among the hottest months for auto sales in the United States as buyers take advantage of significant discounts provided by the car manufacturers to clear inventory.
Analysts expect overall 2019 U.S. sales to fall by about 1% from 2018, but still finish above 17 million vehicles for the fifth consecutive year. 
But sales could dip below the 17-million mark this year, industry experts have warned, as the demand has peaked following the long bull-run since the 2008 financial crisis. 
""Pent-up demand among consumers is drained,"" said Haig Stoddard, senior industry analyst at forecasting and analytics firm Wards Intelligence, adding that he expects sales to dip further this year as economic growth also slows from 2019. 
Auto consultants LMC Automotive and J.D. Power have forecast total light-vehicle demand to decline 1.4% to 16.8 million units in 2020.
""Manufacturers will face a lot of pressure to stand out in a crowded market with nearly 60% more redesigned or new entries in 2020 than there were in 2019,"" Jeff Schuster, LMC Automotive global vehicle forecasts president, wrote last week.
Overall incentive spending by automakers as a percentage of vehicle retail prices remains close to 11%, the highest level since the 2008 recession, according to the auto consultants.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), which was hit by a month-long strike by its 48,000 hourly employees, reported a 6.3% fall in sales for the fourth quarter at 735,909 vehicles. 
""Our fourth-quarter stocks were leaner than we wanted, but as we get ready to launch our all-new full-size SUVs, we look forward to another solid year in 2020,"" said Kurt McNeil, vice president, GM U.S. sales operations.
GM's total U.S. sales fell 2.35% to about 2.9 million vehicles last year, with volumes of its Trax compact SUVs surging about 30% to 116,816 units. Sales of its Cruze cars slumped 66%. 
Toyota Motor Corp reported a 5% drop in U.S. passenger car sales last year, compared with a 0.8% dip in sales of its trucks and SUVs. Total sales declined 1.8% to 2.4 million vehicles. 
Sales of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV dipped 1% to 2.2 million vehicles in 2019. The Jeep maker reported an 18% jump in Ram pick-up truck numbers.
""We have read the expectations that sales may slow a bit in 2020,"" said Reid Bigland, head of U.S. sales at Fiat Chrysler.
Silicon Valley carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc delivered about 367,500 vehicles during 2019, just meeting the low end of its target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.
Nissan Motor Co's 2019 U.S. sales plunged by 10% to a six-year low of 1.3 million vehicles. The automaker remains embroiled in a crisis after former boss Carlos Ghosn was arrested in Japan in 2018 for financial misconduct - a charge he denies. He fled to Lebanon early this week after escaping from Japan.

Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co is scheduled to report quarterly sales on Monday.

The FTC's announcement it was issuing an administrative complaint came hours after Axon sued the agency in a bid to have potential antitrust litigation heard in a U.S. district court.

Axon, the manufacturer of Taser stun guns and body camera systems for police departments, has been the target of FTC scrutiny since 2018, when the regulator requested information from the Arizona-based company about its acquisition of Vievu.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes fell from record highs on Friday after a U.S. air strike in Iraq ratcheted up tensions in the Middle East and a bigger-than-expected contraction in the U.S. manufacturing sector raised concerns of slowing economic growth.
Friday's decline put the benchmark S&P 500 in the red for the week, snapping a five-week winning streak for the index.
Demand for safe-haven assets soared as Iran vowed revenge for the killing of Qassem Soleimani, head of its elite Quds Force, in an air strike authorized by U.S. President Donald Trump.
In a further blow to U.S. market sentiment, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that U.S. factory activity contracted in December by the most in more than a decade.
""There was a reinforcement of weak manufacturing activity and then you had the geopolitical spark,"" said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. ""That's on top of the sentiment that the market has been overbought.""
S&P 500 bank stocks dropped 1.6% as the news sent benchmark U.S. bond yields (US10YT=RR) to their lowest since Dec. 12.
Shares of airlines also tumbled as oil prices jumped about 3%.  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) shares dropped 5.0%, while shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) fell 2.1%.
Among the S&P 500's 11 major sectors, only real estate and utilities (SPLRCU) - both considered defensive plays - ended higher.
In a sign of investor jitters, U.S. stocks extended their fall following a false report of an attack on a U.S. military base in Iraq.
Shares of U.S. defense companies jumped on news of the air strike that killed Soleimani.  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) shares climbed 5.4% and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) shares rose 3.6%. The two provided the biggest boosts to the S&P 500.
The market disturbance following the strike could be fleeting, said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer of Vantagepoint Investment Advisers in Washington.

TORONTO/LONDON (Reuters) - Canadian miner First Quantum Minerals Ltd is weighing investment of around $1 billion to lift output at Africa's biggest copper mine in Zambia, a company document seen by Reuters showed, despite a feud with state miner ZCCM-IH over project funding.
The investment would add a decade of life and head off production declines at the Kansanshi copper mine, increasing annual production to 300,000 tonnes over time from an expected 235,000 tonnes last year, according to a company presentation given to Zambian government officials.
But securing board approval, which would be needed over the coming year, is likely to be complicated by disputes between miners and the Zambian government over taxes and assets, according to analysts and miners with knowledge of the country.
Western miners are on edge as Zambia and neighboring countries seek to increase their share of revenue from natural resources.
Zambia hiked copper royalty taxes by 1.5 percentage points last year and introduced a new 10% rate when global prices exceed $7,500 per tonne, consultancy Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft said. 
Mines Minister Barnaby Mulenga last month said copper miners would also have to account for the gold they produce to boost state revenue. 
""We do not anticipate any fresh investments to extend the life of copper mines while this, and increased taxation, hangs over miners,"" Verisk Maplecroft senior analyst Indigo Ellis told Reuters on Friday. 
A source close to First Quantum said the plans will be presented to the company's board this year but the project is unlikely to win approval without significant changes to Zambia's tax regime.
Shares of First Quantum extended losses after the Reuters story and were down 6.3% at C$12.44 on Friday afternoon in Toronto.
First Quantum contemplated expanding Kansanshi in 2011 at a cost of $1.5 billion, but that project was shelved. 
Without investment, output would drop sharply from 2022 to about 130,000 tonnes by the middle of this decade, the presentation shows.
Canadian-listed First Quantum is studying expansion amid a dispute with Zambian state miner ZCCM-IH over profits from the mine that have been set aside for the project. 
ZCCM-IH owns 20% of Kansanshi Mining PLC, with First Quantum holding the balance.
First Quantum last month began arbitration proceedings against ZCCM-IH following a criminal complaint made by the state miner to Zambian police over a transfer by Kansanshi Mining to a First Quantum subsidiary.
At issue is a transfer of $520 million, a separate document seen by Reuters showed. Two sources said the money had been set aside in a high-interest account to help fund expansion at Kansanshi.
First Quantum was not available for immediate comment on Friday. ZCCM-IH did not immediately respond to a Reuters query.

Sources declined to be identified as the information was not public.

“There’s always the possibility of a ‘heart attack,’ or shock, perhaps caused by global risks,” Barkin said in the text of a speech Friday in Baltimore. “Imagine an escalation with Iran or a collapse in international economies.” Barkin’s prepared remarks came hours after -- but didn’t explicitly reference -- the U.S. strike that killed one of Iran’s most powerful generals and sent global markets reeling.
The Fed’s three interest-rate cuts in 2019 were a form of insurance against rising global uncertainty that have paid off “through the traditional channels, such as auto and home sales,” Barkin said.
U.S. central bankers last month left the benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range of 1.5% to 1.75% at their final meeting of the year and forecast continued growth -- albeit at a slowing pace -- for 2020 through 2022. Minutes of that gathering will be released in Washington later Friday, at 2 p.m.
The Richmond Fed chief -- who doesn’t vote on interest rates this year -- said he’s paying close attention to consumption of big-ticket items, such as homes and durable goods, and filings for unemployment benefits. He also said financial risks are worth watching, especially in the area of corporate lending, much of which is happening outside the regulated banking system.
Barkin said the U.S. expansion could be supported by a reduction in uncertainty to promote a better climate for business decision making.
“That includes trade actions and trade uncertainty, regulatory changes and regulatory uncertainty, geopolitical challenges and domestic politics,” Barkin said. “In my view, the biggest boost to our economy would come from lessening the uncertainty and lowering the volume.”"

Traders shorting Tesla have lost about $900 million in just the first two trading days of 2020, adding to mark-to-market losses of $2.9 billion last year, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.
Tesla said on Friday it delivered 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, beating expectations of 104,960 vehicles, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It delivered approximately 367,500 vehicles during all of 2019, just meeting the low end of its target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.
That report pushed Tesla's stock up 3.7% to $446.21, bringing its gain in the past three months to about 90% in a rally fueled by a surprise third quarter profit and signs of progress ramping up production at the company's new factory in China.
Tesla on Friday said it demonstrated a production run-rate capability of more than 3,000 units per week at the Shanghai factory.
Overall short interest in Tesla is about $11.9 billion, and while some traders have cut their losses in recent months, Friday's rally did not appear to be forcing significantly more traders to capitulate, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of Predictive Analytics at S3 Partners.
About 21% of Tesla's shares are currently sold short, down from about 28% in October, according to S3 Partners.
Chief Executive Elon Musk's progress has defied skeptics expecting Tesla to be overtaken by more established car companies, including General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and BMW (DE:BMWG).
""We think questions remain about first half 2020 results and gross margin sustainability; we point out that Tesla is already lowering prices in China and faces a flood of (electric vehicle) competition in the U.S., with at least 25 new models debuting this year,"" CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in a client note on Friday. Nelson upped his price target for Tesla by $80 to $400 and maintained his ""hold"" opinion.
Worries about demand for Telsa's Model 3 sedan sent the company's stock down to 2016 lows last June, but since then the shares have surged 150%.
The gains in Tesla's shares have elevated its market capitalization to $80 billion, compared to GM' market value of $52 billion and Ford's market capitalization of $37 billion."

OSAKA, Japan (Reuters) - A quiet lounge in a corner of Japan's third-largest airport was likely the last stop for Carlos Ghosn before he fled the country, transforming the former Nissan chairman into one of the world's most famous fugitives.
Ghosn departed on a private jet from Kansai International Airport in the western city of Osaka, the plane's operator said, meaning he would have left from the small lounge area used exclusively for private flights.
The aircraft operator, Turkish firm MNG Jet, said one of its employees had admitted falsifying records by not including Ghosn's name in the official documentation. 
Ghosn faces charges relating to alleged financial crimes in Japan and was able to orchestrate his departure despite being under strict surveillance by Japanese authorities, with movements and communications curtailed. He denies the financial misconduct charges.
""He would have had to go through as a passenger, perhaps in disguise,"" airport spokesman Kenji Takanishi told Reuters.
The slightly built former Nissan boss has concealed his identity before: when first released on bail in March, he walked out of the detention center disguised as a workman to avoid media.
After landing in Turkey, Ghosn switched planes and flew on to his childhood home, Lebanon. His escape capped a year-old saga which has gripped the global auto industry.
Kansai airport spokesman Takanishi said privacy was a big attraction for wealthy travelers at the 300-square-metre ""Premium Gate Tamayura"" - which means ""fleeting moment"" - for private jets.
PASSENGER IN DISGUISE?
Private jet owners pay 200,000 yen ($1,850) to use the facility in Osaka, where normal immigration and baggage procedures apply. Luggage too large for the X-ray scan is opened and examined, Takanishi said, meaning it was unlikely Ghosn could have been smuggled on board.
Yet immigration officials have no record of him leaving, public broadcaster NHK has reported. The former auto executive holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship.
""I think I would recognize Ghosn if I took a good look at his face, but we don't really look at people's faces,"" said a security guard at the private gate.
""It would be harder to spot him if he was wearing a disguise or was in a group.""
One airport official, who also declined to be identified, said airlines often outsource security and luggage checks to private security companies in Japan, unlike other countries where government or military officials normally do them.
Outside the terminal entrance, a dedicated parking lot stands less than 100 meters away, allowing a degree of privacy not afforded to commercial jet passengers.

862,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 12:06PM ET</span>","Musk defies skeptics, meets Tesla delivery goal; shares hit record","By Munsif Vengattil and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) beat Wall Street estimates for annual vehicle deliveries and met the low-end of its own target, sending shares to a record high in a vindication for Chief Executive Elon Musk after a few turbulent years. 
Boosted by demand for its mass-produced Model 3 sedans as overseas sales pick up, Tesla on Friday said it delivered 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 92,550 Model 3s and 19,450 Model S/X SUVs, which was above expectations of 104,960 vehicles, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The Silicon Valley carmaker delivered approximately 367,500 vehicles during all of 2019, just meeting the low end of its target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019.
Tesla shares were up as much as 5.5% at $454, touching a record high. 
The stock has had a strong run in recent months after posting a rare profit in the latest quarter and news of China ramp up. With a market valuation of more than $80 billion, Tesla is far outstripping those of traditional carmakers General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
(Graphic: Tesla 2019 share movement click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/15/3945/3945/tesla.png) 
The delivery results defy skeptics of Musk, whose mercurial behavior over the last two years came under close scrutiny from federal regulators and shareholders of Tesla.
Musk, who has more than 30 million Twitter followers, has a history of firing off tweets that resulted in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a defamation trial against him.
The Tesla CEO settled the SEC complaint for $20 million in 2018 and a Los Angeles jury cleared Musk in the defamation case in December. 
""Elon has Tesla executing right on track,"" said Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin. 
CHINA RAMP-UP
Tesla also provided an update on its Shanghai factory, which has started churning out Model 3 cars. It said the plant demonstrated a production run-rate capability of more than 3,000 units per week. 
The run-rate shows that the factory appears to be ramping faster than expected, Baird Equity Research analyst Ben Kallo said. ""Shanghai deliveries should be the next catalyst to drive volume growth.""
The $2-billion factory, Tesla's first car manufacturing site outside the United States, is the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world's biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S.-made cars.
A company representative on Thursday said that Tesla will deliver its first China-made Model 3 sedans to the public on Jan. 7. 
The Model 3 is Tesla's most affordable car, with lower-range versions available starting at $35,000.
Analysts in the past have questioned how rapidly Tesla's vehicle sales will grow as government subsidies for electric vehicle purchases dwindle in the United States, China and other markets. Some analysts consider those subsidies the biggest driver for Tesla purchases.
Traditional automakers largely relying on fuel-powered vehicles on Friday reported a decline in fourth-quarter U.S. sales and saw their shares tumble as a widening conflict with Iran pushed oil prices more than $2 a barrel on Friday.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) on Friday said it saw a 2% fall in U.S. auto sales, while GM reported its fourth-quarter U.S. deliveries were down more than 6%.
""The recently escalating geopolitical uncertainties driving oil prices higher are likely to create a tailwind for TSLA shares,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer said.

863,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 12:03PM ET</span>","Disruptions But No Black Swans in Middle East (Yet), Say Markets","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Markets hate black swans and always will. Ever since Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s book of 2007, any extreme but very unlikely event has been labelled a “black swan” in a reference to the philosophy of knowledge. Just as Europeans were justified in believing that all swans were white, until they discovered Australia and realized that some swans are black, so markets have difficulty dealing with events for which there is little precedent.
With the decade only three days old, its first bona fide geopolitical shock has already shown us the problem. The news that the U.S. had killed Qassem Soleimani, leader of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards’ Quds force, is a significant escalation of a conflict that has simmered for decades. All-out war between the U.S. and Iran is now more likely than it was before. And it is wise to assume that Iran will follow through on its promise of “severe retaliation” for an act that it describes as an act of war.
The situation is unmistakably grave. It happened when liquidity in international markets was low, with many traders still finishing off their Christmas season vacation, and when optimism was rife. The main U.S. share indexes closed last year at record levels, with valuations that looked dangerously stretched, while risk assets around the world had enjoyed a rally on the back of easing tensions in the American trade conflict with China.
Taking all of this into account, the market reaction is remarkably calm. Oil, as measured by Brent and West Texas Intermediate futures prices, has of course risen. But by 9 a.m. in New York, Brent was still no higher than it had been on Dec. 30. WTI briefly hit its highest in seven months (slightly exceeding the $63.38 level it reached in September last year after an Iranian-backed drone strike knocked out production at a Saudi Arabian oil facility), but remains below its highest levels of the last year.
Gold, a traditional haven at times of international uncertainty, rose but still remained just below the six-year high it set last summer at the height of concerns over the trade conflict. Bond yields fell, again showing that investors wanted a haven, but only to levels they set a week or two ago. Stock markets had a bad but unremarkable day. Serious damage was restricted to those companies, such as airlines, which are most exposed to higher oil prices.
Why have markets managed to stay this calm? One big reason is that the price of oil, which is why events in the Middle East generate such concern, is less important than it used to be. The development of shale in the U.S. as an alternative source of supply, and moves toward alternative sources of energy, have reduced global dependence on Middle Eastern oil, and also made it harder to sustain price rises. Even the spike after the attack in September was fully reversed within two weeks.
Further, higher oil prices, if sustained, tend to translate into a cheaper dollar, which at present is an almost universally desired outcome. A cheaper dollar would boost trade, relieve pressure on emerging markets’ dollar-denominated debt, and flatter the overseas earnings of currently overvalued U.S. multinationals. A higher oil price would also help the many shale producers with weak balance sheets strengthen their positions. It would be unlikely to stimulate any great extra supply. So the judgment is that any rise in oil prices would be short-lived and survivable. 
Second, there are arguments about exactly what “all-out war” or “severe retaliation” would mean. Iran has a number of options. It could resort to further attacks against U.S. targets in the region, or attempt to close the Straits of Hormuz, or conduct further assaults on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. But with crude less critical to the world than it used to be, all of these represent containable risks from the cold-blooded perspective of the capital markets.
Iran cannot invade the U.S., or threaten it with nuclear weapons. A black swan would be some terrorist attack on U.S. soil to match the scale of the Sept. 11 attacks of 2001. If Iran already has the capability to do such a thing, then the probability of it happening has increased. I have no idea how to measure that probability, and neither has almost anyone responsible for allocating capital.
There is another black swan on the horizon. The U.S. could conceivably resort to an invasion of Iran, along the lines of its 2003 invasion of Iraq. Such a move wouldn’t command domestic support, and any such conflict would probably inflict financial and human costs on the U.S. that would outstrip its wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, or even Vietnam.
We cannot be totally certain that this won’t happen. And it is fair to say that the risk of such a conflict has just increased, from some very, very low number to another very low number. Were it to happen, markets would go through a huge sell-off — but again, measuring exactly what the damage would be in a hypothetical and unprecedented situation is difficult to the point of pointlessness.
That leaves investors with nothing to do but acknowledge the possibility that black swans exist, and for now price in only the most direct effects of the latest escalation of a conflict that has rumbled on as a background risk for many years. This is alarming and unsettling, but investors’ judgment so far seems to be correct. "

866,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 08:52AM ET</span>",UK tobacco shares rise on U.S. e-cigarette ban exemptions,"By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Shares in  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) and Imperial Brands Plc (L:IMB) rose on Friday after the U.S. health regulator exempted menthol and tobacco from a list of popular e-cigarette flavors that it has banned under new guidelines.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday said e-cigarette makers will be banned from selling pod-based e-cigarette flavors, including fruit, dessert and mint, in the United States from February. 
The ban was less stringent than one U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed in September, when he threatened to remove all flavors, including menthol, from all types of e-cigarettes to curb a teenage vaping epidemic.
BAT shares rose as much as 2.5% and were the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 index (FTSE) where many shares were hit by heightened tensions in the Middle East.
Imperial Brands was also among the handful of gainers, with its shares up 1.4%. 
Fears of an outright ban led BAT and Imperial to lower their growth forecasts for their U.S. vaping businesses last year. 
""Following a significant period of disruption and uncertainty, this regulatory clarity is a welcome step towards returning the U.S. vapor market to stability,"" BAT, the maker of Lucky Strike, Dunhill and Vuse e-cigarettes, said on Friday.
The new FDA guidelines would also allow tobacco makers to bring back some of the banned flavors if their marketing applications passed a substantive review by the FDA.
This removed some ambiguity related to the future of the exempted products, Simon Evans, spokesman for Imperial Brands said. 
""In addition to exempting menthol, the FDA guidance is clear that flavored products will return to the market once they have been approved through the Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) process,"" he said. 
Brokerage Jefferies said that while vaping sales would take a near-term hit from the new rules, the overall financial impact for BAT and Imperial would be minimal as most users would either switch to menthol or tobacco, or even to higher-margin traditional tobacco products.
""We are actually bullish on implications of this final guidance,"" Jefferies said. 
BAT submitted a marketing application for its Vuse Solo e-cigarette to the FDA in November, while Imperial said it would submit its applications for its Blu e-cigarettes before May.

While many people celebrated the holidays last week, the U.S. central bank published a study trying to quantify the effect of the disputes between the U.S. and its major trading partners, particularly China.
The Dec. 23 paper by Fed Board economists Aaron Flaaen and Justin Pierce concluded American tariffs had more costs than benefits for the sector they intended to help — manufacturing. A Wall Street Journal editorial this week heralded the study as evidence that protectionism backfires and helps explain why economic growth has decelerated to 2% from about 3%.
The Fed paper is noteworthy for a few reasons. First, it came from an institution Trump has belittled and bemoaned for more than a year for keeping interest rates too high. It’s also the latest in a series of credible research that blows holes in arguments for import taxes just as the White House prepares to chalk up a trade win against China after nearly two years of tariff pressure.
Flaaen and Pierce’s research found that tariffs drove up the cost of inputs for American manufacturers. Combined with retaliation taken by trading partners, that led to a relative loss in manufacturing jobs and higher factory gate prices. Importantly, the study did not include the effects of trade-related uncertainty, which some economists believe has had the most significant effect on the U.S. economy by contributing to a stalling in business investment.
A publication date so close to Christmas may have helped the paper avoid widespread attention, but it’s unlikely to have been missed by the doves on Trump’s trade team. While some of them may be relieved that phase one of a trade deal with China is set to be signed on Jan. 15, European Union trade chief Phil Hogan plans to be in Washington that same week hoping to convince the administration what the Fed has determined — that tariffs ultimately do more economic harm than good."
871,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>","Sunrise's CEO Swantee, Chairman Kurer quit after failed Liberty Global deal","By John Miller and Edward Taylor
ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Sunrise Communications (S:SRCG) chief executive Olaf Swantee has quit and Chairman Peter Kurer said he will not run for re-election after a shareholder uprising blocked the group's $6.3 billion bid for Liberty Global's (O:LBTYA) Swiss cable unit.
Sunrise said its Chief Financial Officer Andre Krause, a German national, will immediately succeed Swantee as the new CEO, a step which was welcomed by  Freenet  (DE:FNTGn), the telecom firm's largest shareholder.
Freenet, a German telecommunications company which holds a 24.56% Sunrise stake, was a vocal opponent of the UPC deal.
Freenet said it did not want to pre-empt strategic decisions by Krause but said they had received assurances from the incoming CEO that he sees a stand-alone future for Sunrise. Krause had previously backed the UPC combination.
""In the past weeks Freenet has spoken with him about potential changes, and he made it clear that he sees a successful future for Sunrise as a stand-alone company. This convinced us,"" Freenet said of Krause.
""We believe in the future and the potential of the company. The attractive dividend, a great team and a very well-managed company are guarantees for a high shareholder return,"" Freenet said. ""There is no reason for us to change our position.""
Krause declined a request from Reuters for an interview, with a spokeswoman saying he first wants to talk to employees and customers before going public in his new role.
""Management and the board -- with the exception of the Freenet representative -- were firmly convinced that the takeover of UPC was the best plan, but that does not mean Sunrise cannot be successful on its own, too,"" the spokeswoman said.
""Sunrise will continue its path as an independent company and Andre Krause, as new CEO, will further strengthen this successful direction.""
DISPUTED DEAL
Sunrise shares, which dropped 12% in 2019 during the takeover battle, were up 0.5% by 1210 GMT.
In the months-long UPC fight, Swantee and Kurer had become the public faces of the deal, arguing it would have created a more powerful rival to state-owned market leader  Swisscom  (S:SCMN).
Freenet had accused Swantee and Kurer of pursuing a transaction that would have saddled Sunrise with ""inferior technology"" at an inflated price and terms favorable to Liberty Global, but negative for the Swiss company's own shareholders.
Krause has been at Sunrise since 2011 after a six-year stint as CFO of  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) O2 Germany, and ""has been instrumental in its transformation"", the group said in its statement.
""As CFO, he drove the company through its successful IPO in 2015, and the subsequent sale of its tower assets. Andre has deep telecom industry expertise.""
Sunrise said Vice Chairman Peter Schoepfer would also leave. Like Kurer he declined to stand for another term after the deal for Liberty's UPC Switzerland unit failed in October."

Wharf Holdings, the shopping center's owner and Vuitton did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Vuitton's parent group LVMH (PA:LVMH), the Paris-based conglomerate behind other fashion brands like Christian Dior and Hennessy cognac, declined to comment.
High-end fashion labels have hunkered down in Hong Kong since anti-government demonstrations escalated in June, hoping the turmoil would ease in one of the world's top shopping destinations.
Until now, the luxury brands had only shut stores in Hong Kong temporarily when protests flared. 
Hong Kong has long drawn numerous tourists from the Chinese mainland who pick up luxury cosmetics, accessories and clothing at slightly lower prices than at home.
But as the protests dragged on, tourist arrivals have slumped and losses began to trickle through to third-quarter earnings.
Hong Kong's retail sales fell 23.6% from a year earlier in November to HK$30 billion ($3.85 billion), government data showed on Friday, in the tenth consecutive month of declines.
The protests have spilled into 2020, with some 400 people arrested in New Year's Day demonstrations when a pro-democracy march descended into chaos.
Some brands are weighing up redirecting some of their investments elsewhere, including to the Chinese mainland and other parts of Asia where many have managed to make up for lost sales in Hong Kong. 
Executives at LVMH and its rivals like puffer jacket maker Moncler (MI:MONC) or Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) have said they were trying to renegotiate notoriously high rents in Hong Kong as one way of mitigating the hit to operating margins. 
But the brands are likely to have to contemplate a larger retreat from Hong Kong in the longer term, where some have too many shops, consultancy Bain said in November.

HSBC (L:HSBA) (HK:0005) will suspend overnight services at 19 ATM clusters in Hong Kong on weekends and public holidays, the bank said on Friday, two days after its branches and ATMs were targeted during protests.

U.S. stock futures dropped and Asian shares reversed gains, while oil spiked along with the yen and gold. Qassem Soleimani, a feared Iranian general who through proxy militias extended his country’s power across the Middle East, was killed at the direction of U.S. President Donald Trump. The risk-off move deepened after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said “severe retaliation” awaited Soleimani’s killers.
The shock news comes after most asset classes had a stellar 2019, with U.S. equities capping one of the best years of the past decade.
Here are 10 analysts and money managers on what it means for the market outlook:
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA
Kit Juckes, chief FX strategist in London
“Gold’s a winner as tension increases, and oil prices are higher too. Bond yields are lower, the equity rally which was underway in the U.S. has stalled but not gone dramatically in reverse, and in the FX market, safe havens and oil-sensitive currencies benefit but it’s the yen which is the clear winner.
“The key level to watch is probably EUR/JPY 120. That probably holds unless there is further escalation.
“Given the scope for tension to persist in the Strait of Hormuz, a protracted period of higher oil prices has to be a risk.”
 Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA
Valentin Marinov, head of G-10 currency research in London, who calls the timing of the escalation “unfortunate.”
It could “dash market hopes for a rebound of the global economy that is still to emerge from under the cloud of the U.S.-China trade war. Risk sentiment should remain fragile also because central banks may be slow to respond or simply no longer have the arsenal to respond in an adequate way.”
He calls the yen and Swiss franc “attractive,” while saying the conflict could weigh on “risk-correlated oil importing currencies like the Korean won.”
 ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV
Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist in London
“Recent episodes of U.S./Iran tensions have not resulted in material escalation but even in a fairly benign outcome to this crisis, the bid in U.S. Treasuries and bunds should last at least into next week.”
Colombo Wealth SA
Alberto Tocchio, chief investment officer in Lugano, Switzerland
“The ‘severe retaliation’ aspect is possibly what is scaring the markets as it could mean that there will be a counter-attack versus American diplomats. Markets could use this excuse to take some profits as sentiment and positioning are possibly too high.
“We would then use the possible weakness to increase our equity exposure.”
Saxo Capital Markets Pte.
Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist in Singapore
“We are moving potentially from proxy (Iran) versus proxy (Saudis and U.S.) to potentially direct Iran-backed forces versus U.S. forces.” However, “net-net, I struggle to see what Iran can really do.
“People are still not back at their desks fully until next week to mid-January, so illiquidity could give us some overreaction to the downside. Still, let’s see how the next 24 to 48 hours play out. Remember, it’s the weekend already in the Middle East.”
The gain in oil “honestly feels a touch overdone.” But this is positive for U.S. defense spending and even French defense stocks could get a boost later, he noted.
“So much for Trump calling troops home.”
Covenant Capital Pte.
Edward Lim, money manager in Singapore
“This attack merely highlights the geopolitical risk of the oil markets, and the market undergoing a possible oil shortage in the first one to two quarters of 2020.
“We didn’t do anything on the news as we have already bought some oil stocks such as CNOOC and Total when oil was trading close to $60s at the end of 2019.”
UOB Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd.
Steven Leung, executive director in Hong Kong
“Investors are worried that the situation in Iran will worsen, since there could be some retaliation after the U.S. attack. People will want to cut risk ahead of the weekend. Stocks have rallied a lot in the past month or so, so any bad news flow is a reason to take profit.”
Mizuho Bank Ltd.
Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist in Hong Kong
“The reversal of risk-on sentiment will keep Asian FX under pressure. The USD Index also appeared to find a footing. These factors will probably prompt profit-taking flow on EM Asian FX. The magnitude could be amplified by thin liquidity during the New Year holiday.”
TD Securities
Mitul Kotecha, senior emerging market strategist in Singapore
“Risk appetite has worsened as reflected in the weakness in high-beta currencies in the region in particular. Much now depends on whether there is any retaliation. In the near term, losses in risk assets are likely to be contained.”
Credit Agricole
David Forrester, a foreign-exchange strategist in Hong Kong, who predicts the yen could rise to 106 per dollar by the end of the first quarter.
“The market is pricing in risk of a potential Iranian response to the U.S. air strikes, which is pushing up gold and oil prices as well as the yen.
“There has been a lot of good news priced into the market in terms of the U.S.-China trade deal and U.S. economic growth. U.S. ISM manufacturing data out later today will be critical in determining whether dollar-yen can break below its two-month trading range.”

876,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 05:52AM ET</span>","After Tesla's record year in Norway, rivals gear up for 2020","By Victoria Klesty and Lefteris Karagiannopoulos
OSLO (Reuters) - New electric car sales in Norway rose by a third last year amid soaring demand for Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) vehicles, but the pioneering U.S. company will face a more competitive market in 2020 as rivals prepare to launch new electric models.
Fully electric cars made up 42.4% of sales in the Nordic country last year, a global record, rising from a 31.2% market share in 2018 and just 5.5% in 2013, the Norwegian Road Federation said on Friday.
Norway, which is Europe's biggest oil and gas producer, is seeking to become the first country to end the sale of fossil-fueled cars by 2025. The country has exempted battery-powered vehicles from the taxes imposed on petrol and diesel engines and after just a few years the streets of Oslo have become quieter and have less air pollution.
Most of Norway's top-10 cars in 2019 were electric, including Volkswagen's Golf (DE:VOWG_p), Nissan's (T:7201) Leaf, Audi's (DE:NSUG) e-tron, BMW's (DE:BMWG) i3, Jaguar's I-PACE and several of Hyundai's (KS:005380) models.
New car sales in the country last year were 142,381, of which 60,316 were fully electric. This year, as many as six in 10 of all new cars sold in the country could be fully electric, said Volkswagen (VW) distributor Harald A. Moeller AS, which is preparing to launch several models in 2020.
Other importers predicted the market share in 2020 would be in a range of 50-60% of all sales.
""The electrification of the car market is accelerating ... we forecast electric vehicles to hold a 100% market share in 2025,"" Volkswagen said of the outlook for Norway.
The country's best-selling car in 2019 was Tesla's mid-sized Model 3 sedan, which retails from 384,900 Norwegian crowns ($43,721.74), racking up an 11% market share in the California-based firm's first attempt at cracking the mass market.
Rising global awareness of climate change has encouraged a shift in regulation, technology and consumer preferences, disrupting the auto industry and boosting Tesla's share price to make it one of the world's most highly valued car brands.
This year, the company will start producing a medium-sized sport utility vehicle, the Model Y, but faces competition from a plethora of rivals, including by Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, VW's Audi and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
""There will be between 20 and 30 new electric models on the market in 2020, many of them launching early in the year,"" the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association said in a statement.
Ford late last year unveiled the Mustang Mach-E SUV, which it hopes will help turn around its flagging fortunes.
""It will compete with Tesla's models 3 and Y. I also think Audi e-tron is a big competitor. The customers have waited for this car for over two years,"" said Kjetil Hagestande, chief executive of Ford importer RoehneSelmer.
""This amazing car with four-wheel drive and long range fits the Norway market perfectly,"" Hagestande told Reuters on the sidelines of the Mach-E launch in November.
Also aiming for a slice of Norway's market is China's Geely [GEELY.UL] group, whose Polestar and Volvo brands will begin producing fully electric cars this year.
In October, Polestar opened its first European showroom in Oslo's most upmarket shopping district, rubbing shoulders with fashion designers rather than with rival auto makers.
""I'm here to consider a new car because my wife already has her second electric car, a Hyundai,"" said Espen Cook, a retired IT worker, on a recent visit to the Polestar venue.
""Two months ago I sold my hybrid Lexus so I would like to go full electric,"" the 70-year-old told Reuters.

877,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>","Ghosn used our jets illegally in escape from Japan, Turkish company says","By Ezgi Erkoyun and Makiko Yamazaki
ISTANBUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - A Turkish private jet operator said on Friday that ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn used two of its planes illegally in his escape from Japan, with an employee falsifying lease records to exclude his name from the documents.
MNG Jet said it had filed a criminal complaint over the incident, a day after Turkish police detained seven people, including four pilots, as part of an investigation into Ghosn's passage through Istanbul en route to Lebanon. 
Ghosn has become an international fugitive after he revealed on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, where he faces charges relating to alleged financial crimes.
Lebanon on Thursday received an Interpol arrest warrant for Ghosn, whose surprise escape from his home in Tokyo to a separate home in Beirut has not been fully explained. 
Japanese public broadcaster NHK, citing investigative sources, said a surveillance camera captured the former Nissan Motor Co chairman leaving his Tokyo residence alone shortly before his escape. 
The security footage was taken by a camera installed at his house in central Tokyo around noon on Sunday, and the camera did not show him returning home, NHK said. 
By early Monday, he had touched down in Istanbul.
MNG Jet said in its statement it leased two jets to two different clients in agreements that ""were seemingly not connected to each other."" One plane flew from Osaka to Istanbul, the other from Istanbul to Beirut. 
""The name of Mr Ghosn did not appear in the official documentation of any of the flights,"" it said. 
""After having learnt through the media that the leasing was benefiting Mr. Ghosn and not the officially declared passengers, MNG Jet launched an internal inquiry and filed a criminal complaint in Turkey,"" it added.
An employee admitted to falsifying the records and confirmed he ""acted in his individual capacity,"" the company said. 
The pilots and other detainees, including two airport ground staff and one cargo worker, were sent to court on Friday after giving statements to police, according to a Reuters witness.
Ghosn has said he will speak publicly about his escape on Jan. 8. 
Some Lebanese media have floated a Houdini-like account of Ghosn being packed in a wooden container for musical instruments after a private concert in his home, but his wife has called the account ""fiction"".

NHK said police suspected Ghosn may have left his home to meet up with someone before heading to an airport. Under the terms of his bail, Ghosn was required to have security cameras installed at the entrance of his house.

879,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 05:44AM ET</span>",First 3 Weeks of Year Can Be an Emerging-Market Red Herring,"(Bloomberg) -- Beware of recency bias when you invest in emerging-market stocks in January. What seems like a new-year trend could be short-lived, data suggest.
In the past 21 years, investors who made full-year bets based on the first three weeks of trading lost money on at least 12 occasions as equities reversed direction in the fourth week and went the opposite way for the rest of the year. This suggests early January trading is often a spillover from the December sentiment and can be a contra-indicator of things to come.
This year, the MSCI Emerging Markets entered bull market after it crossed key technical thresholds in the middle of last month, buoyed by the prospect of a preliminary trade deal between the U.S. and China. That streak of optimism has taken the gauge to the highest level since June 2018.
Based on that, should investors pencil in a second-year rally in stocks, and even possibly the recouping of all trade-war-related losses? Not yet, history cautions. If a positive trend carries on beyond Jan. 21 or thereabouts, then there’s a good chance it’s for real.
Here are the lessons from the past:
Dotcom Boom and Bust
In 1999, the MSCI gauge made a faltering start after the missteps of the previous year, including a debt default in Russia and a government collapse in Turkey. But the year ended up with a runaway rally as the dotcom boom peaked.
In 2000, the opposite occurred. Stocks kept advancing into the New Year, but a sell-off in late January was an omen of the dotcom bust that really began in April.
U.S. Recession in 2001
A massive rebound of 11% in the first three weeks fizzled as the U.S. economy contracted.
Fed Stimulus-Led Rally
Even though the Federal Reserve had taken its benchmark interest rates close to zero and unleashed its first quantitative easing in the closing months of 2008, the pessimism surrounding the financial crisis lingered well into January. Emerging-market stocks slumped, before turning around and posting their best-ever annual performance.
Taper Tantrum
Months before then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s indication of a roll-back in stimulus came in the middle of 2013, emerging-market stocks had started their slide. But one would have scarcely guessed from the brisk start to the year.
China’s Yuan Shock
The year 2015 was a nightmare for China, and by extension, emerging markets. A stock slump in Shanghai, which the government worsened with strong-arm tactics and an unexpected depreciation of the yuan in August, took the wind out of investors’ sails. The year had begun positively enough, though, with a 2% gain in the first three weeks.
Post-Fed Rebound
A Bloomberg survey of money managers at the start of 2016 found most of them pessimistic about emerging-market stocks. Just weeks earlier, the Fed had hiked rates for the first time in almost a decade and that led to a sell-off of more than 13% between New Year and Jan. 21 - hardly a signal for the rally that followed.
Trade War
A bullish start on the back of the previous year’s $3.9 trillion rally lost steam in the fourth week of January 2018. The reason: Donald Trump ignited his trade conflict with China on Jan. 22 with tariff hikes on solar goods.
Truth be told, early January trading hasn’t always been a dud. It correctly predicted full-year moves on the following occasions:



WHEN STARTING TREND CORRECTLY PREDICTED FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK


2003 Commodity Rally


2008 Great Financial Crisis


2011-2012 Euro-Area Debt Crisis


Oil Slide of 2014


Boost From Donald Trump’s Policies in 2017

Investing.com -- The 2020 rally in European stocks didn’t last long.
Markets were down across the board on Friday after a U.S. airstrike in Iraq killed a senior commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the latest in a series of lethal incidents that have raised fears of a broader confrontation between the U.S. and Iran.
A textbook “risk-off” move has followed, with most equities falling and the price of Oil as well as haven assets such as bonds and Gold all rising. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 reversed all of its gains from Wednesday and more, falling 0.7% to 416.86 by 5:20 AM ET (1020 GMT). The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.4%, while the German DAX was down 1.5%.
As usual, the airline sector is among the worst hit, although the two big underperformers – Germany’s Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) – have other woes to worry about, too.
According to reports, Lufthansa got its second downgrade in as many days on Friday morning, with Kepler analysts downgrading it to “reduce” with a price target of 14.30 euros. On Thursday,   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) had downgraded it to “sell” from “hold” with a target of 14 euros. The targets imply a downside of nearly 10% from the stock's current level.
That followed the outbreak of a new wave of strikes at its discount flyer Germanwings, where cabin crew are pursuing better conditions for part-time work. The strikes caused 180 flights to be cancelled over three days of the busy holiday season. 
Given that discount airlines like Germanwings are the last great hope of the old-school flag carriers in defending their market share, and given Lufthansa’s already low operating margins, the last thing it needs is a simultaneous increase in both fuel and labor costs, as well as strikes that reduce aircraft availability. The shares were down 7%.
Air France-KLM, another national champion dogged by chronic labor problems, was down even more – by 7.6% - after two of its unions, representing both pilots and cabin crew, called a strike for Monday and Tuesday to protest the pension reforms of President Emmanuel Macron.
Elsewhere in the sector, Ryanair (LON:RYA) CEO Michael O’Leary was also in the news, telling the German magazine Wirtschaftswoche that the airline may have to wait until October for its first delivery of 737 MAX aircraft from Boeing (NYSE:BA). He also said he won’t talk about compensation until it’s clear when it will receive the planes it has ordered. Ryanair is one of the biggest European buyers of the 737 MAX, having ordered 135 planes. The report implies that none will be operational in time for the key summer season."
882,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 05:14AM ET</span>",Ryanair CEO says group may not get 737 MAX until October: report,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) may only receive its first delivery of the grounded 737 MAX aircraft from Boeing (N:BA) in October, chief executive Michael O'Leary said in an interview with German magazine Wirtschaftswoche.
The 737 MAX, Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft, has not flown since last March following two crashes which claimed 346 lives. O'Leary told Reuters last month that Ryanair may not receive any MAX aircraft in time for its summer season.
One of the world's largest airlines, Ryanair has 135 of the planes on order, but none in service. O'Leary has previously said it would not take orders in July or August because it is the airline's busiest time of the year.
""We were meant to have 58 planes by the summer,"" O'Leary said in the interview, extracts from which were published on Friday. ""That went down to 30, then 20, then 10 and the latest is maybe only five. It's possible we'll only get the first jets in October 2020.""
United Airlines last month extended the grounding of its in-service MAX flights until June, the longest period that any U.S. carrier has scheduled for keeping the aircraft out of service.
Boeing has been criticised by regulators, suppliers and airlines for providing what have turned out to be unrealistic estimates for the model returning to service and said last month that it was freezing 737 production in January. 

In contrast to other airlines which have already agreed compensation with Boeing, including Turkish (IS:THYAO), Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) and Germany's TUI (DE:TUIGn), O'Leary said he would only discuss recompense after the planes were delivered.

""Media reports on postponement of Shanghai-London Stock Connect do not match facts,"" said Chang Depeng, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, told a regular news briefing in Beijing.
""From the opening of the Shanghai-London Stock Connect to now, it has been operating normally.""
Reuters reported on Thursday, citing five sources, that China had temporarily blocked planned cross-border listings between the Shanghai and London stock exchanges because of political tensions with Britain.
The report followed the delay of a listing of global depository receipts (GDRs) in London by Shanghai-listed SDIC Power Holdings Co Ltd (SS:600886), an alternative energy operator, which cited market conditions as the main reason.
SDIC would have become the second Chinese company to use the Stock Connect scheme to list GDRs in London after Huatai Securities (SS:601688) (HK:6886) completed a listing in May.
Regarding the delay, Chang said the CSRC ""respects each company's own decision to list based on its own financing needs and market situation.""
He said that trade in, and cross-border transfers of, Huatai GDRs were operating normally.
Chang said some onshore companies had shown interest in cross-border listings through the Stock Connect, and that it would continue to improve links between onshore and offshore capital markets, as well as strengthening cooperation with overseas regulatory institutions, Chang said.
The Stock Connect scheme began operating last year."
884,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 04:59AM ET</span>","Oil, safe havens surge as U.S. strikes kill Iranian commander","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose over $2 a barrel and gold and other safe-haven assets jumped on Friday, as the U.S. killing of a top Iranian commander in an air strike in Iraq ratcheted up tensions between the two powers.
Traders were clearly spooked. The death of Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani, head of the elite Quds Force, prompted Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to vow revenge. 
Europe's stock markets fell 0.5% in early trading as hopes for a lengthy New Year rally vanished. Safe havens gained, with Japan's yen  rising half a percent to the dollar to a two-month high and the Swiss franc hitting its highest against the euro since September. (EURCHF=)
The Middle East-focused oil markets saw the most dramatic moves. Brent crude futures jumped nearly $3 to $69.16 a barrel -- also the highest since September -- before easing back to $68.42. 
""We are only into the third day of the new year, and a big fat dollop of geopolitical uncertainty has landed on investors' desks,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at broker OANDA.
""I am struggling to see how an Iranian riposte will not occur,"" he said. ""Oil installations and tankers were my first thoughts.""
Soleimani's Quds Force and its paramilitary proxies, ranging from Lebanon's Hezbollah to the PMF in Iraq, have ample means to mount a multi-pronged response.
In September, U.S. officials blamed Iran for a missile and drone attack on oil installations of  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), the Saudi state energy giant and world's largest oil exporter. The Trump administration did not respond, beyond heated rhetoric and threats.
SCRAMBLE TO SAFETY
German Bunds and U.S. Treasuries -- the world's benchmark government bonds -- caught a bid, too. Ten-year German yields, which move inversely to prices, fell further away from seven-month highs touched earlier in the week. U.S. 10-year yields fell 5 basis points to a three-week low.
The focus on geopolitics meant markets paid little attention to stronger-than-expected data from France, where inflation rose 1.6% year-on-year in December, beating analyst expectations for a 1.4% rise.
""Markets still remain quite thin after the holidays, but even in a regular session we would have seen a similar reaction,"" said Christian Lenk, a rates strategist at DZ Bank in Frankfurt. ""The repercussions from the air strike are not clearly forecastable and tensions remain high in the region.""
The air strikes in Iraq also killed top Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. They came after U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Thursday there were indications Iran or forces it backed might be planning additional attacks, after Iranian-backed demonstrators stormed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
Gold, a traditional refuge for risk-averse investors, rose 1% to a four-month high of $1,543.66. For the week, it has gained about 2%, heading for a fourth consecutive weekly increase.

HSBC strongly denies any connection.
The 19 groups of ATM machines are located in common protest hotspots. As a precautionary measure they will be closed from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, the days before public holidays and on public holidays until further notice, the bank said in a statement.

887,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 02:17AM ET</span>",Premarket London: Next Raises Guidance After Strong Christmas,"Investing.com -- Here is a summary of the most important regulatory news releases from the London Stock Exchanges on Friday, 3rd January. Please refresh for updates.
Retailer   Next   (LON:NXT) nudged up its forecasts for full-year profit and sales after a Christmas holiday season that went marginally better than it expected.
The company also gave initial guidance for the year ending 2021, saying it expects per-share earnings to rise 3.5% on a 3% increase in sales on a comparable basis. For the current year, it now sees EPS at 458.7p, up 5.4% on this year.
In the crucial two-month period before Christmas, Next said full-price product sales rose 5.3% from last year’s levels, helped by a much colder November and improved stock availability. Sales fell 3.9% at the company’s high street stores but rose 15.3% via its online channel.
The company also said changes to the way the U.K. authorities collect corporate income tax mean that it will reduce the distribution of surplus cash to shareholders by 35 million pounds in the next two fiscal years, in order to keep its financial debt down.

  British American Tobacco   (LON:BATS) put a brave face on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s move to clamp down on flavoured vaping products, saying that it is “well positioned” to meet the new regulatory requirements.
BAT said its U.S. subsidiary Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) has already filed one so-called Pre-Market Tobacco Application with the FDA and will make further applications for approval of the rest of its vapor portfolio by the May 12 deadline.
On Thursday, the FDA had announced a ban on sales of fruit- and mint-flavored vaping cartridges but said it would still allow those flavors to be sold from tanks in vaping shops. All vaping products will, however, need to have asked for regulatory approval by May 12. 
The measures are thus more of a blow to those that already have such products widely available on the market than to BAT, which has lagged players such as Juul Labs and NJOY.

Energy markets regulator Ofgem said that power generators Oersted (CSE:ORSTED) and RWE (DE:RWEG_p) will each pay 4.5 million pounds ($5.9 million) into its redress fund in connection with the massive blackout that left millions of customers without power on Aug. 9 last year.
Orsted's Hornsea One wind farm and RWE's Little Barford went offline after a lightning strike, causing a disruption to power supplies that lasted several hours. 
Ofgem additionally exacted a 1.5 million pound payment from U.K. Power Networks, a local power distributor, for reconnecting customers without permission by the system operator ""which could have jeopardised recovery of the system.""
UKPN is owned by Li Ka Shing's CK Infrastructure Holdings.
Discount airline Ryanair (LON:RYA) said it ended the year with a 9% rise in passengers to 11.2 million. The group’s main airline posted a 7% increase in passengers to 10.7 million, while its recently acquired Lauda subsidiary raised passengers by 67% to 0.5 million.
Elsewhere, chief executive Michael O’Leary told the German magazine Wirtschaftswoche that he expects yet more delays to the delivery of the 737 MAX aircraft the group has ordered from Boeing (NYSE:BA).
""We were meant to have 58 planes by the summer,"" Reuters quoted him as saying in the interview, extracts from which were published on Friday. ""That went down to 30, then 20, then 10 and the latest is maybe only five. It's possible we'll only get the first jets in October 2020."""

889,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 01:41AM ET</span>",U.S. farmers see another bleak year despite Phase 1 trade deal,"By Karl Plume and P.J. Huffstutter
CHICAGO/DIMMITT, Texas (Reuters) - Across snow-covered North Dakota, U.S. farmers are stuck with fields full of weather-damaged corn - a crop they planted after the U.S.-China trade war killed their soybean market. Many don't know yet what crops they'll plant next season among a host of dicey options.
In Texas, Kansas and Colorado, farmers are weighing whether they should plant fewer acres of corn and more sorghum, even though China has all but stopped buying it. That's because sorghum costs about half as much as corn to plant, which appeals to farmers wary of investing too much for an uncertain return.
As the U.S. farm economy reels from the worst harvest in decades after nearly two years of the trade war, U.S. grain growers are struggling to decide what crops might keep them in business.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced last month that China had agreed to double its pre-trade war purchases of U.S. agricultural products over the next two years as part of a Phase 1 trade deal. That brought little comfort to U.S. farmers because China still has not confirmed the commitment or signed any deal.
""President Trump said that we're all going to need to go buy bigger tractors,"" said North Dakota farmer Justin Sherlock. ""I don't think many farmers are going to invest much money until we see that this is a done deal and a long-term deal.""
Trump administration officials say the Phase 1 trade deal with China will be signed in January, though many tariffs will remain in place during further negotiation. Commodity market analysts and agricultural economists warn an agreement won't be an immediate fix for the U.S. farm economy because the conflict has spurred China to develop new supply chains.
China has, for instance, deepened ties with rival exporters such as Brazil and Argentina. Brazilian soy cultivation is expanding after record exports to China in the past year and China is investing in South American ports.
Making matters worse, China's need for soy and sorghum to feed livestock is waning because of a deadly pig disease that experts estimate has killed off about half the world's largest hog herd. China's hog industry has also worked to reformulate pig rations to include less soy and more alternative feeds that don't have to be imported from the United States.
""We won't go immediately back to where we were 18 months ago - maybe not for a long time,"" Jay Debertin, chief executive officer of CHS Inc, the largest U.S. farmer cooperative, told grain producers at a recent conference in North Dakota.
For a graphic on China's falling imports of U.S. farm goods, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Q63lO7 
'WE'RE DONE' WITHOUT MORE TRADE AID
Many U.S. farmers have tried shifting crops to dodge the economic fallout from losing such a crucial export market. They planted 76.5 million acres of soybeans in 2019, 14.3% fewer than the previous year, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture data. U.S. plantings of sorghum - used in livestock feed and the fiery Chinese liquor baijiu - dipped about 7.5% in 2019, to 5.3 million acres. Plantings of cotton have dropped, too, as China pulled back on purchases. 
Plantings of such China-dependent crops likely would have fallen much further were it not for the Trump administration's allocation of $24.5 billion in aid to compensate farmers for trade-war losses. The bailouts gave many farmers an incentive to keep planting crops such as soybeans that they knew would be difficult to sell at any profitable price. Government handouts are expected to account for nearly a third of 2019 net farm income, according to federal government and bank regulatory data.
Trump administration officials have not said if farmers will get more payments in 2020. Robert Johansson, chief economist at USDA, told Reuters he expected the interim trade deal would solve the issues that the aid program had addressed.
USDA Deputy Press Secretary Alec Varsamis said the agency would decide in January on future payments. White House spokesman Judd Deere declined to comment and referred to previous statements by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has said China committed to ""massive"" U.S. agriculture purchases.
Farmers in export-dependent regions say they can't continue to sell their crops for below the cost of production without a third round of subsidies to cover the losses.
""If the government doesn't pay us, we're done,"" said Sherlock, who did not vote for Trump in 2016 and remains undecided for 2020. 
Most farmers have backed the president as he seeks re-election, according to polls by Reuters and farm media outlets. In 2016, they were drawn to Trump's promise to shake up Washington bureaucracy and hoped the trade war, although it might bring short-term losses, would eventually improve the size and scope of China's U.S. agricultural purchases.
DAMAGED CORN
Farmers last season intended to use more of their land for corn – a crop aimed at markets outside China - but that backfired for many growers when extreme weather prevented planting on millions of acres. Early seed orders for 2020 suggest farmers will again turn to corn to replace soybeans, China's largest agricultural import. Scott Beck - president of Beck's Hybrids, the largest family-owned U.S. retail seed company - told Reuters that sales of corn seed for 2020 planting are already up about 40% from 2019.
Sherlock and many of his neighbors last spring sowed one of North Dakota's largest-ever corn crops by acreage. They were enticed by rising springtime prices and the promise of trade aid as long as they planted something. They figured their corn would find buyers among domestic livestock or ethanol producers or in established export markets such as Japan, South Korea or Mexico. But bad weather left almost 60% of the state's corn - about 2 million acres - unfit for harvest at winter's onset, according to USDA.
Many growers are caught in limbo. Their fields are not bad enough to trigger crop insurance payouts but not good enough to recoup costs. And trade-aid payments for North Dakota are not robust enough to cover losses, with larger per-acre aid payments flowing to southern states.
Sherlock says he might contract to grow more soybeans for a local seed company, a niche crop that costs more to grow but could reap higher prices. Field peas, used in grain-free pet foods, are another option.
Iowa corn and soybean farmer Mitchell Hora is also seeking alternatives. He sowed winter wheat and rye in fall of 2018 and sold the cleaned seed to fellow producers, and has more recently contracted to sell rye to a start-up malting company.
""The agricultural system is completely broken” because of the trade war, severe weather and mounting farm debt, Hora said. ""We have to farm smarter."" 
BEST OF BAD OPTIONS
Farmers in the High Plains of Texas, the second-largest sorghum-producing state, also face hard choices. China's imports of U.S. sorghum in 2019 were less than one-tenth of the volume purchased four years earlier, according to the most recent government data.
Still, the production cost for an acre of sorghum in this heavily irrigated region will be about half the cost of planting corn, according to Texas A&M AgriLife Extension data. Farmer Robert Boozer of Dimmitt, Texas – who grows cotton, corn and sorghum – said he and his neighbors pray for a time when the trade war no longer factors into planting decisions.

He's agonizing over the per-acre costs of different crops and the break-even selling prices he'll need to stay afloat. For now, he'll plant more sorghum - ""the best option in a field of terrible options.""

(T:7201)’s former leader Carlos Ghosn used a spare French passport to pull off a dramatic escape from Japan this week, according to Al Jazeera.
The businessman was smuggled out of Tokyo by a private security company days ago, according to the article.
Ghosn said this week that he had fled to Lebanon, which does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, to hide from what he called a “rigged” justice system. He noted that he would talk to reporters next week. Analysts have earlier said that he could be armed with “ potentially damaging details about current Nissan executives.”
“There must be many people at Nissan and Renault who think this could really be dangerous for them if Ghosn speaks,” said Koji Endo, a senior analyst at SBI Securities in Tokyo.

The reduction, partly thanks to 24,750 yuan of subsidies, from an earlier 355,800 yuan is among a slew of adjustments Tesla has made to its sales policy in China, including tweaking prices for car accessories and home charging facilities.
Tesla has said it plans to start delivering cars, made at its $2 billion factory in Shanghai, to the public on Jan. 7. 
Fifteen Tesla employees who had purchased the car were the first to take delivery on Monday after the first China-made vehicles rolled off the plant's production line in October. 
The deliveries come a year after construction of Tesla's only plant outside the United States began. 
Earlier this week, Tesla said that 30% of its China supply chain was localized, which means some car parts are shipped in to build its cars. The automaker wants to completely localize its China supply chain by end-2020, it said at the time. 
Tesla plans to ramp up Model 3 deliveries in January and will double the number of service centers and fast charging stations in China in 2020, its executives have said.
The plant has achieved a production target of 1,000 units per week, or around 280 cars a day, and that sales for the China-made sedan had so far been ""very good"", according to the executives.

BEIRUT/TOKYO (Reuters) - Lebanon received an Interpol arrest warrant on Thursday for former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn, while Turkey launched an investigation into his daring escape from Japan via Istanbul.
Ghosn has become an international fugitive after he revealed on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, where he faces charges relating to alleged financial crimes. 
Sources close to Ghosn said a delay to a trial and a strict ban on communicating with his wife motivated him to go ahead with a plan to use a private security company to smuggle him out of Japan via private jet.
The Interpol red notice, which calls on authorities to arrest a wanted person, was received by Lebanon's internal security forces and has yet to be referred to the judiciary, a Lebanese judicial source told Reuters.
A senior Lebanese security official said it was not yet clear if Ghosn would be summoned for questioning over the warrant but said Lebanon does not extradite its citizens to foreign states.
In past cases in which Lebanon has received red notices for Lebanese citizens resident in the country, the suspects have not been detained but their passports have been confiscated and bail has been set, the judicial source said.
Ghosn holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship. He has deep ties to Lebanon, the country of his childhood, where his investments include a stake in a bank, real estate and a vineyard. 
Sources close to Ghosn said he met with Lebanese President Michel Aoun shortly after arriving to Beirut and was greeted warmly, though the presidency denied such a meeting took place.
Speaking to broadcaster MTV, caretaker defense minister Elias Bou Saab said Lebanon played no official role in Ghosn's exit from Japan. 
Turkish police on Thursday detained seven people, including four pilots, as part of an investigation into Ghosn's passage through the country, a police spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman said the other detainees were two airport ground staff and one cargo worker, and all seven were expected to give statements in court on Thursday.
Flight tracking data suggests Ghosn used two different planes to fly to Istanbul and then to Lebanon.
TRIAL DELAYED 
The sources close to Ghosn said he was prompted to flee after a recent court session in which he learned that the second of two trials would be delayed until April 2021.
""They said they needed another whole year to prepare for it. ... He was distressed about not being able to see or speak to his wife,"" one of the sources close to Ghosn said.
A request to see or speak to his wife over Christmas was also denied, the sources added, part of strict conditions set on his bail.
The sources said Ghosn had grown distressed that authorities were pressuring his family to draw a confession from him after his daughter and son were questioned by Japanese prosecutors in the United States in early December.
In just his second public comment since landing in Beirut, Ghosn said in a statement his family played no role whatsoever in his exit from Japan.
""I alone arranged for my departure,"" he said. 
Ghosn was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018 and faces four charges for alleged financial crimes including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to car dealerships in the Middle East. He denies the charges.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK said on Thursday Japanese authorities allowed Ghosn to carry a spare French passport in a locked case while out on bail, potentially shedding some light on how he managed to escape despite having passports held by Japanese lawyers.
No one was immediately available for comment at the office of Ghosn's lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, at the French embassy in Tokyo, or at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.
Nissan ousted him as chairman, saying internal investigations revealed misconduct including understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5 million of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest.

898,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 04:59PM ET</span>","Wall Street starts 2020 with new records on China stimulus, trade hopes","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes notched record highs to open the new year on Thursday, as fresh economic stimulus from China added to optimism fueled by easing trade tensions and an improving global outlook.
China's central bank said on Wednesday it would cut the amount of cash that all banks must hold as reserves, the eighth such cut since early 2018. The move to inject fresh stimulus into the Chinese economy boosted equity markets around the globe.
The benchmark S&P 500 hit its 11th record high in 14 sessions and posted its largest daily percentage gain in three weeks. The Dow registered its biggest such gain in almost four weeks, and the Nasdaq its greatest in nearly three months.
Economic stimulus in China, along with the easing of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, has bolstered optimism that the global economy will accelerate in 2020.
""The market's been up all day because of the news that China is out there with monetary easing,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""With the trade deal as a backdrop, it's a positive factor.""
Among the S&P 500's sectors, technology (SPLRCT) and industrials (SPLRCI), both of which have high exposure to the Chinese economy, rose more than 1% and led in percentage gains. Shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL), which have been a bellwether of trade sentiment, ended 2.3% higher and surpassed $300.
The lengthy rally on Wall Street has prompted some concerns that U.S. stocks are vulnerable to a pullback, especially if economic growth does not pick up as much as expected or if U.S.-China trade tensions reignite.
""Large-cap equities are priced for perfection,"" said Peter Cecchini, global chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. ""It feels like we're wildly overbought given the risks that we see.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 330.36 points, or 1.16%, to 28,868.8, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 27.07 points, or 0.84%, to 3,257.85 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 119.59 points, or 1.33%, to 9,092.19.
Adding to positive economic sentiment, data from the U.S. Labor Department showed the number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits edged lower last week.
Other data from Greater China showing that gross gaming revenue in Macau fell less than expected in December boosted shares of U.S. casino operators. Shares of  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN),  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (N:LVS) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd (O:MLCO) rose between 2% and 4%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 59 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 115 new highs and 15 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.61 billion shares, compared to the 6.85 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days."
899,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 04:56PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for Jan. 3,"Investing.com – Here are three things that could rock the markets tomorrow.
1. ISM PMI Seen Rising
On the U.S. economic calendar tomorrow the highlight will be the Institute of Supply Management’s measure of December manufacturing.
Those numbers will come out at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
The ISM purchasing managers’ index (PMI) is predicted to have ticked up to 49 last month, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Construction spending data arrive at the same time, with a 0.3% rise seen for November.
In Europe, German December jobs numbers come in at 08:55 GMT, with economists looking unemployment change to show a gain of 2,000 for the month, with the unemployment rate staying steady at 5%.
2. Fed Minutes Arrive
The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its December meeting at 2:00 PM ET (19:00 GMT), although the market seems to have made up its mind that this tightening trend is over for now.
The FOMC left its benchmark rate unchanged at 1.5% to 1.75% last month and indicated it was happy with where monetary policy stands.
The Fed’s next meeting is Jan. 28-29 and there’s a more-than-95% it will keep rates steady, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
In fact, the markets aren’t looking for any rate movement for 2020, with a chance of more than 50% that the fed funds rate will be the same when the FOMC decides this December.
3. Oil Stockpile Build Expected
Like the Fed minutes, weekly oil inventory numbers are delayed due to the market holiday this week.
They’ll arrive tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET (16:00 GMT) when the Energy Information Administration issues its report.
Oil inventories for the week ended Dec. 27 are expected to have dropped by about 3.3 million barrels, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Gasoline inventories are forecast to have risen by 2.1 million barrels. Distillate stockpiles are seen posting a build of 1.8 million barrels.
U.S. oil production will also be closely watched, with traders concerned about a jump in shale oil supply given oil’s high prices to end the year."
900,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 04:42PM ET</span>","HSBC kicks off year with Hong Kong branches closed, vandalized","By Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) (HK:0005) is being drawn into Hong Kong's political turmoil with protesters attacking some of its branches and graffiti daubed on the famous pair of lions that guard its city-center headquarters.
Hong Kong is the bank's single most important market, accounting for just over half of its $12.5 billion pre-tax profits in the first half of 2019, though with the protests tipping Hong Kong's economy into recession, HSBC and its peers are expected to take a financial hit. 
Until now, HSBC had largely escaped direct involvement in the often-violent anti-government protests that have shaken Hong Kong for more than six months even as other companies with perceived links to Beijing have seen premises vandalized, including Bank of China (Hong Kong) (HK:2388), Hong Kong's second largest bank behind HSBC. 
But more recently, HSBC has drawn the ire of some protesters who accuse it of being complicit in action by the authorities against activists trying to raise money to support their campaign.
Protesters link the bank's closure in November of an account held by a group called Spark Alliance, which helps pay protesters' legal costs, to the December arrest of four Spark Alliance members on money laundering charges. 
HSBC has strongly denied any connection. 
""People are angry because they feel that HSBC has stopped money getting to the protesters,"" one protester said on Wednesday, of the decision to close the account as he stood in a group taking photos of the damaged lions. 
HSBC said in a statement after the arrests that the decision to close the account was ""in accordance to international regulatory standards"".
""Our decision is completely unrelated to the Hong Kong Police’s arrest of the four individuals on 19 December 2019. We closed the account in November 2019 following direct instruction from the customer,"" the bank said.
It is highly unusual for HSBC to comment on individual cases.
Two HSBC branches and seven indoor ATM clusters were closed on Thursday, the first working day of the year. 
Some had their windows smashed and ""support Spark Alliance"" was spray painted on their walls during a New Year's Day anti-government protest march. Others were damaged during protests on Christmas Eve. 
The two lions were daubed with graffiti and briefly set alight after being doused in a flammable liquid.
HSBC said on Thursday initial cleaning of the lions had begun. 
""We are engaging conservation experts to advise us on the professional restoration required and the process can take time,"" the bank said in a statement. 
'FINE LINE'
More than 90% of the $4.4 billion generated by HSBC's retail banking and wealth management unit in the six months to last June, came from Hong Kong.
HSBC has also deployed billions of dollars in China’s southern Pearl River Delta region, adjacent to Hong Kong, and has expanded its services in the world’s second largest economy.
Some analysts believe HSBC executives will have to explain their Hong Kong strategy when they discuss annual results on Feb. 18.
John Cronin, an analyst with Goodbody, said he expects to hear about a push to grow in other Asian nations, especially emerging markets, as unrest in Hong Kong continues.
""Even putting aside the political turmoil in Hong Kong, HSBC's dependence on Hong Kong for profitability is something I expect that management will seek to tackle,"" Cronin told Reuters. 
Beijing plans to integrate the Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong and Macau to create an economic powerhouse under its Greater Bay Area Initiative. 
HSBC's entanglement in the protests underlines the tightrope that companies have had to walk since the protests got going in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
The demonstrations have evolved into a broad pro-democracy movement.
""Clearly, there is a fine line for management to draw between customers and the Chinese authorities,” said a head of corporate governance at a UK-based asset manager and HSBC shareholder.
Other Hong Kong companies have been damaged by being perceived to be too supportive of the protests.
Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) was forced by Beijing to suspend staff involved in the protests, and chief executive Rupert Hogg and his top deputy resigned in August amid the turmoil. 
HSBC has previously been targeted by supporters of Beijing.
Users of China's Weibo social media platform shared screenshots last year of an HSBC employee's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts supporting the protests. The posts urged readers to complain to HSBC management. 

""Businesses now have to consider how three different groups will react to their decisions: The Chinese government, Hong Kong protesters, and Chinese consumers,"" said Kent Kedl, head of Control Risks' Greater China practice.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 04:42PM ET</span>",Trump administration restricts some e-cigarette flavors,"By Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday announced a ban on some popular e-cigarette flavors, including fruit and mint, to curb rising teenage use of vaping products, allowing only menthol and tobacco flavors to remain on the market.
The ban came under immediate criticism from public health advocates who said it does not go far enough.
But Alex Azar, the U.S. Health and Human Services secretary, called the approach a ""smart, targeted policy that protects our kids without creating unnecessary disruption.""
The flavor ban applies to cartridge-based e-cigarettes, which typically use disposable pods filled with liquid nicotine and are often sold in convenience stores. It does not apply to most e-cigarette liquids that are purchased separately, a variety most often sold in vape shops and used in so-called open tank e-cigarettes.
Gary Reedy, chief executive of the American Cancer Society, called it ""a hollowed-out policy that will allow the tobacco industry to continue to attract kids to a lifetime of nicotine addiction.""
Representative Frank Pallone, the Democratic chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, which has launched probes into e-cigarette manufacturers, dismissed the impact of the ban.
""A flavor ban that exempts menthol and vape shops is no ban at all,"" Pallone tweeted.
President Donald Trump's administration in September proposed a sweeping ban on all e-cigarette and vaping flavors that are seen as attracting millions of young users to addictive nicotine products. That plan would have prohibited all e-cigarette flavors except tobacco. However, Trump later expressed concerns that enacting the ban could lead to an underground market for illegal vaping products and potential job losses.
U.S. e-cigarette market leader Juul Labs Inc, which is 35%-owned by Marlboro-maker  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO), over the last year has pulled fruit, dessert and mint nicotine flavors from retail stores and its website in the United States amid heightened scrutiny of the surge in teenage use. 
Thursday's announcement would have no impact on Juul, which has already pulled flavors except tobacco and menthol. It would force competitors still offering a wider variety of flavors, including Njoy and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co (L:BAT), which makes Vuse e-cigarettes, to restrict their offerings.
The percentage of high schoolers using e-cigarettes stands at 27.5%, according to federal surveys, up from 20.8% in 2018.
Research from the Journal of the American Medical Association found that mint was by far the most popular flavor among U.S. 10th- and 12th-grade Juul users, with more than 40% saying it was the most frequently used variety of nicotine pod. 
In banning mint but not menthol, HHS Secretary Azar said the administration was following an ""evidence-based, science-based public health approach."" Data that became available after the Trump administration's September announcement showed that mint was highly popular among teens but menthol was not, he said.
But public health advocates expect that teenagers will simply switch to menthol.
""The evidence indicates that if menthol e-cigarettes are left on the market, kids will shift to them,” said Matt Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “Decades of experience with menthol cigarettes demonstrate that menthol appeals to kids.""
The new policy will go into effect in early February, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will begin enforcing it against e-cigarette makers that continue to sell unauthorized flavors. All e-cigarette makers face a May deadline to apply to the FDA for permission to continue selling their products.

902,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 04:13PM ET</span>",Tech Leads U.S. Stocks to Opening-Day 2020 Rally: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks started the year on the front foot, building on strong gains for many asset classes in 2019 as investors cheered the latest policy move by China’s central bank to support its economy. Treasuries and the dollar strengthened.
The S&P 500 jumped 0.8% to a record on the year’s first trading day, with megacaps Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and   Nike   Inc (NYSE:NKE) notching all-time highs. It was among the best starts for U.S. stocks in the past decade, though first-day performance has virtually no bearing on how the year plays out. Tech shares led gains, with Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) surging 7% after an upgrade. Small caps underperformed, with the Russell 2000 sliding 0.1%.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced as every sector finished in the green. Gauges in Hong Kong and Shanghai jumped more than 1% after the People’s Bank of China said it will increase the supply of cheap funding to banks, in line with market expectations.
“You’ve had a good liquidity-driven momentum-type rally toward year end and that momentum is carrying on in and of itself,” said Kevin Caron, a senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors.
The euro fell as data showed the region’s manufacturing downturn deepened in December. The dollar stayed higher as U.S. jobless claims dropped to a four-week low, while the pound weakened following its best quarter in a decade.
After a stellar 2019 across most major assets, focus now shifts to the year ahead. Thursday gave investors the latest read on Chinese manufacturing, with the Caixin PMI dipping slightly from its November level but remaining well in the expansionary zone. On the trade front, U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this week said he expects to sign the first phase of a deal with China on Jan. 15, though Beijing has yet to confirm the date.
“Good start to the year -- China gave the markets a little jolt to start the year with a liquidity injection into their market,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA. “The message is that central banks are going to continue to help sustain growth or actually try to generate more growth in the markets and interest rates will stay low.”
Investors are also keeping an eye on geopolitical tensions, including in North Korea, where Kim Jong Un said he was no longer bound by his pledge to halt major missile tests and would soon debut a “new strategic weapon.” In Baghdad, an Iran-backed Iraqi militia broke up its encampment outside the U.S. embassy after an attack on the compound threatened to spiral into a broader confrontation.
Elsewhere, crude oil pared an earlier advance, while gold climbed. The Thai baht fell as much as 1.8% overnight, its biggest drop since 2007, amid speculation the Bank of Thailand could be intervening to curb the currency’s strength.
Here are some events to watch for this week:
Federal Open Market Committee minutes will be released on Friday.U.S. ISM manufacturing is due Friday. The Institute for Supply Management’s PMI is forecast to show a contraction for a fifth straight month.These are some of the most recent moves in major markets:"
903,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 01:59PM ET</span>","Greece, Israel, Cyprus sign EastMed gas pipeline deal","By Angeliki Koutantou
ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece, Cyprus and Israel on Thursday signed a deal to build a 1,900 km (1,180 mile) subsea pipeline to carry natural gas from the eastern Mediterranean's rapidly developing gas fields to Europe.
Although Turkey opposes the project, the countries aim to reach a final investment decision by 2022 and have the pipeline completed by 2025 to help Europe diversify its energy resources.
European governments and Israel last year agreed to proceed with the so-called EastMed project, a $6 to $7 billion pipeline project that is expected initially to carry 10 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Israeli and Cypriot waters to the Greek island of Crete, on to the Greek mainland and into Europe's gas network via Italy. 
The energy ministers of Greece, Israel and Cyprus - Kostis Hatzidakis, Yuval Steinitz and Yiorgos Lakkotrypis - signed the final agreement on the pipeline at a ceremony in Athens.
Last month a Turkish official said there was no need to build the EastMed pipeline because the trans-Anatolian pipeline already existed.
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said any project that ignored the rights of Turkey and Turkish Cypriots over natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean would fail.
""The most economical and secure route to utilize the natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean and deliver them to consumption markets in Europe, including our country, is Turkey,"" he said in a statement on Thursday.
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal was not turning against any country.
""It (the agreement) ... supports a common aim for peace, security and stability in the particularly vulnerable region of the Eastern Mediterranean,"" Anastasiades said.
The region lacks significant oil and gas infrastructure and political relations between the countries - including Cyprus, Greece, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon and Syria - are strained on a number of fronts.
The signing of the EastMed pipeline comes weeks after Turkey and Libya struck an accord on sea boundaries in the Mediterranean, a move which Greece, Cyprus and Israel opposed.
Analysts say that pact could present a barrier to the proposed pipeline which would have to cross the planned Turkey-Libya economic zone.
""If Turkey would be interested, the door is open,"" Israel's Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz told Reuters.
""We are ready to discuss some kind of cooperation, energy cooperation, also with the Turks. We are not against the Turks but we are very much in favor of the EastMed gas pipeline project,"" he said. 
The pipeline project is owned by IGI Poseidon, a joint venture between Greek gas firm DEPA and Italian energy group Edison.
DEPA on Thursday signed a letter of intent with Energean, a gas producer with a focus on the Eastern Mediterranean, to buy two billion cubic meters of gas annually from Energean's gas fields off Israel via the planned pipeline. 

Greece has said the agreement will be concluded once Italy signs off on it too.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Insurance company Argo Group International Holdings said on Thursday that it will add one board member nominated last year by Voce Capital Management and give the hedge fund a say in seating two new independent directors in the coming months.
Carol McFate, who has held executive positions with a number of insurers and was a former chief investment officer at Xerox (NYSE:XRX), will join the Argo board immediately and serve on its nominating corporate governance committee and an additional committee.
Voce will also participate in identifying and evaluating two new director candidates who will stand for election at the 2020 meeting and one of them will be selected from Voce's nominated slate, the company said in a statement.
The announcement comes three weeks after Argo said five directors, including the chairman, will leave its board at this year's annual meeting, marking a critical turn in a bitter corporate battle that has been dragging on for months.
A company spokesman declined to comment beyond the statement.
Over the last three months, Argo announced that its board chairman, Gary Woods, would leave, that CEO Mark Watson was retiring and would leave the board by the end of 2019 and that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company. Argo also said it was conducting a review of ""governance and compensation matters.""
Besides Woods, Sedgwick Browne, who heads the Risk & Capital Committee, Hector De Leon, a member of the Audit and Human Resources Committee, Mural Josephson, chair of the Audit Committee and John Power, chair of the Human Resources Committee will also depart at the annual meeting.
Earlier in 2019, Voce said it would run a proxy contest and planned to seat five directors, including McFate. It said the company should cut $100 million in expenses, including corporate jets and housing for Watson, and said the board was responsible for a ""culture or indulgence."" In November Voce said it had started the process of calling a special meeting to replace five directors, including Woods, the chair.
On Thursday, Voce sounded a positive note and praised the company for the steps it has taken. Tapping new board members ""and the Company's ongoing governance improvements, are substantive and positive developments that give us confidence in the new course that Argo has charted,"" Voce's portfolio manager J. Daniel Plants said in a statement.

The target was raised to $515 from $375, one of the highest on Wall Street and near the Street-high view of $530. The average price target is about $302, according to Bloomberg data.
The move comes ahead of Tesla reporting fourth-quarter delivery numbers next week. Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer, who reiterated a buy rating on the stock, expects the data will validate the trend of higher electric-vehicle adoption.
“While bears have feared demand issues as a function of tax credit expiration for Tesla, we suspect a solid Q4 combined with the robust Q3 should put these fears to rest,” he wrote to clients. He expects Tesla will report nearly 369,000 units delivered over 2019, above the company’s own guidance of 360,000.
Shares of Tesla rose 1.7% in pre-market trading. The stock gained about 26% over the course of 2019 and recently surged to record levels.

915,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 08:44AM ET</span>",New year cheer for stocks as rally rumbles on,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets began the new year with a shot of Chinese stimulus, ensuring there was no immediate hangover after the wild gains of 2019.
News that China's central bank was freeing another 800 billion yuan ($115 billion) for its economy came after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday that a long-awaited trade pact with Beijing would be signed on Jan 15.
The double lift saw Europe's main markets jump 0.8% to 1.3%, outpacing Asia's overnight gains and putting them on course for their best opening session of a year since 2013. 
MSCI's broadest index of world shares added 0.2% to its 24% 2019 surge, which was the fourth best of all time. Higher U.S. futures suggested solid gains on Wall Street too, with S&P 500 e-minis up 0.5%. 
""Over a longer-term horizon, we believe global stocks have greater performance potential than global bonds, supported by continued growth and moderate inflation,"" Franklin Templeton said in its 2020 outlook, although it stressed it remained cautious for now.
An upward revision to some otherwise gloomy euro zone manufacturing PMI data pushed inflation expectations higher. Germany's 15-year bond yield briefly turned positive for the first time since July. 
Bond yields tend to drive borrowing costs in the wider economy and their drop last year, as the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and dozens of other central banks around the world cut interest rates, helped limit an economic slowdown. 
""Although firms grew somewhat more optimistic about the year ahead, a return to growth remains a long way off,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the purchasing manager indices.
NEW YEAR, NEW GEAR? 
In currency markets, the dollar scored its biggest rise against major peers since early November with a 0.33% gain. 
That snapped a six-day losing streak and pushed the euro off five-month highs, though it was in thin trading and followed a 0.4% drop on New Year's Eve, once it became clear there would be no year-end repeat of September's U.S. money market turbulence.
Sterling dropped to $1.32 and the euro fell back under $1.12. The Aussie and Kiwi dollars took hits and the Japanese yen was little changed at 108.81 per dollar. 
After the stimulus shot in Beijing, China's yuan closed at 6.9631, its strongest finish against the dollar since Aug. 2. The offshore yuan also gained after an initial downward move.
The stimulus -- a cut in banks' reserve requirements -- had been expected before January's Lunar New Year holidays and after Premier Li Keqiang's pledge last month to provide more stimulus.
""At the end of last year the dollar sold off quite sharply, so we are seeing an easing in some of the dollar selling pressure,"" said Lee Hardman, senior FX strategist at MUFG.
""The liquidity squeeze didn't materialise so that's contributing to stability in broader financial markets ... But the dollar story has been turning negative in recent months, partly because of action taken by the Fed to ease dollar liquidity,"" Hardman said, referring to the U.S. central bank's balance sheet expansion re-launched in October.
China's blue-chip CSI300 index, one of the world's best performers last year, rose 1.4%, reaching its highest since Feb. 7, 2018. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 1.25%. 
Oil prices rose as tensions in the Middle East fuelled worries about supply. The U.S. military carried out air strikes against an Iran-backed militia this past weekend. Consequently, protesters stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Wednesday, then withdrew after the United States deployed extra troops.
U.S. crude was up as much as 0.3% to $61.28 and global benchmark Brent crude rose 0.2% to $66.15 per barrel, building on a rise that gave oil markets their biggest annual gain in three years in 2019. 
Gold, which had benefited from a weaker dollar, was up 0.4% on the spot market despite the U.S. currency's gains. It last fetched $1,523 per ounce while China-sensitive industrial metal copper climbed towards an eight-month high.

In 2015 the carmaker admitted to using manipulated engine management software to mask excessive pollution levels in its diesel cars, sparking a raft of prosecutions and lawsuits that have led to at least 30 billion euros in legal costs and fines. 
""Volkswagen and the Federation of German Consumer Organisations vzbv have agreed to enter into discussions regarding a possible settlement,"" the carmaker said. 
""The discussions are at a very early stage, and there is no guarantee that they will result in a settlement. Both parties have agreed that the discussions should remain confidential.""
German consumers have had less success than vehicle owners in the United States in securing compensation from VW because German cars did not lose their road worthiness certification in the wake of the diesel scandal.

In Germany VW's diesel vehicles retained their road worthiness certification if customers agreed to an update of vehicle engine management software, leading VW to take a different approach to compensating consumers.

LONDON (Reuters) - Clearing house EuroCCP said it needs a 1.5 billion euro ($1.68 billion) loan to fix ""liquidity weaknesses"" identified by regulators.
Cboe, the largest pan-European stock market, said on Dec. 10 it had agreed to acquire the remaining 80% of EuroCCP for roughly 36 million euros. The U.S. exchanges operator already owned 20% of the Netherlands based clearer.
Cboe said it planned to fund the deal with cash, pending receipt of regulatory approval and an ""arrangement of a supporting liquidity facility at the EuroCCP clearing entity level"".
It gave no further details at the time but EuroCCP's annual report, published after the takeover was announced, underscores how important the loan is for EuroCCP, which accounts for 30% of European share clearing.
A stress test of clearing houses undertaken by the European Union's European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) identified weaknesses in the liquidity risk management framework when faced with extreme stresses, EuroCCP said in the report.
""As part of the transaction, EuroCCP and Cboe are advanced in putting in place a committed credit facility of up to 1.5 billion euros to ensure EuroCCP meets all relevant (liquidity) requirements"", EuroCCP CEO Cecile Nagel said in the annual report.
""This facility is an important part of a number of new tools and procedures to strengthen our liquidity risk framework, which are expected to be implemented in early 2020 – subject to regulatory approvals.""
EuroCCP had committed to resolving the issue by the end of 2019.
""Given the progress that has been made and the complexity of the matter, regulators have agreed to a later date for solving the liquidity issue,"" it added.
Costs from the loan means that EuroCCP ""may be loss-making for a limited period of time"" but that it was still a ""going concern"" due to surplus capital and was ""confident"" of obtaining regulatory approval.
""In addition, Cboe, as the proposed acquirer of EuroCCP’s entire share capital, will guarantee payment of scheduled interest and fees payable under the loan agreement,"" the annual report said.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark sourced almost half its electricity consumption from wind power last year, a new record boosted by steep cost reductions and improved offshore technology.
Wind accounted for 47% of Denmark's power usage in 2019, the country's grid operator Energinet said on Thursday citing preliminary data, up from 41% in 2018 and topping the previous record of 43% in 2017.
European countries are global leaders in utilising wind power but Denmark is far in front of nearest rival Ireland, which sourced 28% of its power from wind in 2018 according to data from industry group WindEurope.
Across the European Union, wind accounted for 14% of consumption last year, the group says.
The higher proportion of wind energy in Denmark last year was partly due to Vattenfall (VATN.UL) starting operations at the Horns Rev 3 offshore wind farm in the North Sea in August.
The share of power from wind turbines at sea increased to 18% last year from 14% in 2018, Energinet said. Onshore wind accounted for 29% last year.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in October that while power generated from wind turbines at sea only accounts for 0.3% of today's global electricity generation, capacity is set to increase 15-fold over the next two decades.
Denmark aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030, with a new climate law passed late last year targeting an increase in the share of electricity sourced from renewable power to 100%.
Denmark, home to wind turbine giant Vestas and the world's largest developer of offshore wind Orsted, has favourable wind conditions and began investing heavily in wind power in the 1970s."

The Shanghai plant is part of the Silicon Valley automaker's plans to bolster its presence in the world's biggest auto market and minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war. 
Fifteen Tesla employees who had purchased the car were the first to take delivery on Monday after the first China-made vehicles rolled off the plant's production line in October.
The deliveries come a year after construction of Tesla's only plant outside the United States began. Production started in October with a target of 250,000 vehicles per year once the Model Y is added to the line up.
""As Model 3s roll off Tesla's Chinese manufacturing facility with local subsidies intact, we believe the U.S.-based focus will need to shift globally for the company,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a note to clients.
China will be an important market for the company in 2020, said Dorsheimer, who raised his price target on Tesla to $515, the second-highest on Wall Street. 
The Model 3 is priced at 355,800 yuan ($50,000) before subsidies. Tesla said previously that it wanted to start deliveries before the Chinese new year beginning Jan. 25.
Tesla's China general manager, Wang Hao, said the company plans to ramp up Model 3 deliveries in January. 
Tesla executives also told reporters the plant had achieved a production target of 1,000 units per week, or around 280 cars a day, and that sales for the China-made sedan had so far been ""very good"".
Hao had said the company will double the number of service centers and fast charging stations in China in 2020.
Shares of Tesla, which is expected to report its fourth-quarter delivery numbers in the next few days, rose 1.1% to $422.88 in premarket trading. 

The stock, which touched a record high of $435.31 last week, has had a strong run in recent months on the back of posting a rare profit in the latest quarter and news of China ramp up.

Shapps told BBC TV he was no longer willing to tolerate the high level of delays and cancellations suffered by rail customers in the north of England. ""I'm simply not prepared for the service on Northern to carry on as it is and I am taking action,"" he said.
Asked if that meant he would strip Northern of the franchise he said: ""(That is) absolutely the case. I do not think that the service being operated on Northern ... is anywhere near acceptable.""
Britain's model of grouping rail routes into franchises that are run by private operators for a set number of years has been attacked by passengers, unions and politicians, who have said it results in expensive and unpredictable service.
The government has had to take over the running of some lines in recent years after private companies failed to turn a profit.
Northern, which operates services throughout the north of England, has had to apologize for late running and canceled trains, and problems with introducing new timetables.
Arriva won the franchise in 2015 to run the service until 2025, helped by a promise to deliver new and refurbished trains, more services, improved stations and options for lower fares.

The suspension follows the collapse of money manager Neil Woodford's equity fund and comes as regulators seek changes to funds that invest in hard-to-sell assets such as property but enable investors to cash out at short notice.
M&G's funds will reopen ""once cash levels have been sufficiently restored"", the company said in a statement without specifying a date. It is required to update investors on the status of the fund every 28 days at least.
The asset manager, which split from parent  Prudential  (L:PRU) in October, said it had completed the sale of a retail park in Edmonton, northeast London, for 51.4 million pounds and exchanged contracts on a property in Staines, southeast England, for 19 million pounds.
M&G said it had a further 67.2 million pounds in properties under offer or going through legal processes.
Seven property funds with a combined 18 billion pounds under management froze in quick succession after the Brexit referendum in June 2016.
Other property funds have said they are monitoring the market situation.
M&G's funds had 4.8% of their assets in cash - a smaller cash buffer than other major property funds such as those run by Legal and General (L:LGEN) and Aberdeen Standard Investments (L:SLA)."

Investing.com -- European stock markets got off to a flying start in 2020, rising across the board on optimism stoked by China’s latest monetary policy easing and President Donald Trump’s confirmation that the ‘phase-1’ trade deal with Beijing will be signed on Jan. 15.
Stocks were also building on a growing consensus that European markets are at present more attractively valued than their U.S. counterparts. They were also shrugging off as 'last year's news' a round of purchasing manager indices from IHS Markit which showed German, U.K. and Italian factories all in contraction in December.
By 5 AM ET (1000 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was at 419.92, up 0.9% on the day and just off an intraday high of 420.72, which represented a new all-time high.
The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 1.0%, while the German DAX was up 0.8%, while the biggest gains were in Sweden, where the OMX rose 1.9%.
Among the biggest gainers were those that had fared worst in 2019, with banks leaping as bond yields hit their highest in months.   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) rose 5.2% and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) rose 7.0% as the German 10-year bond yield hit its highest since May, easing the pressure of negative interest rates on profit margins. 
  Bankia   (MC:BKIA) led a strong Spanish banking sector with a 4.2% rise, while Santander (MC:SAN) was 3.2% higher, as was Dutch giant   ING Groep   (AS:INGA).
Airbus (PA:AIR) led gains in France, capitalizing on the improvement in the trade outlook and on the woes of its biggest rival, Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Bucking the trend was U.K. independent oil and gas producer   Tullow Oil   (LON:TLW), which fell 4.7% after announcing disappointing drilling results in Guyana. 
Overnight, China's central bank had reduced its reserve requirement for banks again, freeing up some $115 billion in liquidity for banks to use. The move was partly seasonal, given that banks require more liquidity over the coming Chinese new year holiday. "

(Reuters) - European shares started the new decade on a strong note on Thursday on fresh monetary stimulus from Beijing and growing Sino-U.S. trade optimism, while Airbus jumped after a report it toppled Boeing (NYSE:BA) to become the world's biggest planemaker.
The European company (PA:AIR) was set for its best day in three months after Reuters reported it delivered a forecast-beating 863 aircraft in 2019.
The stock helped lift the wider French index (FCHI) by 1.3%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.9%, after declining for two straight sessions as caution crept in about how long a U.S.-China trade truce would last.
But U.S. President Donald Trump brightened the mood on Tuesday by saying the Phase 1 agreement would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House.
Trade-sensitive miners (SXPP) led gains on the main index on Thursday, followed by European banks (SX7P).
""The markets are still broadly riding high on the goodwill generated by the announcement that a Phase-1 trade agreement will be signed on Jan. 15,"" said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex.
""(Beyond that) a lack of further escalation might be all investors can expect for the moment."" 
The benchmark European index ended last year with its biggest annual gain since the global financial crisis on easing recession fears and a loose monetary policy by some of the world's biggest central banks.
Signaling that it stood pat to boost a flagging economy, China's central bank on Wednesday lowered the reserve requirement ratio for banks for the eighth time since 2018, with the latest cut freeing up around 800 billion yuan ($115 billion).
Improving economic indicators from China and the United States had also powered global stocks to record highs last month. [MKTS/GLOB]
Euro zone stocks (STOXXE) jumped 1.1% on Thursday despite latest data showing factory activity in the bloc contracting for the eleventh straight month.
Meanwhile, German shares (GDAXI) rose 0.7%, shrugging off figures that showed the manufacturing sector contracted further in December, with the rate of decline in production accelerating for the first time in three months.
London-listed shares (FTSE) climbed 0.9%. Investors are closely tracking developments around Britain's departure from the European Union, set for Jan. 31.

Missing out on the broader rally,  Tullow Oil  (L:TLW) shares fell 6.1% and were on course for its worst day in over two weeks as the oil producer said a reservoir in its newly struck oil well in offshore Guyana was below its pre-drill estimates.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 04:04AM ET</span>","Hyundai, Kia sales drop to seven-year low on China weakness, forecast better 2020","By Joyce Lee and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) and affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270) turned in their lowest sales in seven years in 2019 as business in China slumped, missing their target for a fifth straight time, but forecast better numbers for 2020.
Weak 2019 sales underline the challenges Hyundai Motor Group has been facing, including a string of annual profit declines at Hyundai and higher costs to develop future technologies even as the global auto market stagnates.
""The market environment is very uncertain and internal and external challenges will intensify,"" Group heir apparent Euisun Chung said on Thursday. But he reiterated that the Group would continue to focus on profitability and technology investment.
Hyundai and Kia reported a 3% drop in their combined global sales to 7.19 million vehicles for 2019, falling short of their target to sell 7.6 million vehicles.
Their sales have slumped in China, the world's biggest auto market, offsetting a recovery in the United States where demand for their new sport utility vehicles and a favorable currency exchange rate have helped.
""TOO AGGRESSIVE""
Hyundai and Kia, however, said they expect combined sales to rise 5% to 7.54 million vehicles this year, without giving any further details. That compares with a 0.4% growth in global market projected by its think tank and a 0.9% contraction forecast by Moody Investors Service.
But analysts caution it will be a daunting task for the car makers, together the world's fifth-biggest by sales, to meet their target for this year.
""I think Hyundai Motor's target may be too aggressive ... my guess is that it assumed a recovery in China, but that's not easy,"" said Kim Pyung-mo, analyst at DB Financial Investment.
""Hyundai underperformed the (China auto) market in November, and it's too early to say that China's industrial demand will be seeing a complete recovery.""
The global auto market is widely expected to stay sluggish in 2020, as demand shrinks further in the United States and Europe, signaling more competition for Hyundai and Kia.
PLANS
Hyundai and Kia plan to launch redesigned SUVs like Hyundai's Tucson and Kia's Sorento in 2020.
They will also accelerate their push for mobility services such as ride-sharing, and have plans to establish operations in the United States, Europe and Asia, said Chung, Hyundai Motor Group's executive vice chairman.
The Group, which in 2019 announced a joint venture with U.S. autonomous driving technology company Aptiv (N:APTV), plans to operate autonomous vehicles in select regions in 2023, and reach commercial production by the second half of 2024, Chung added.
Hyundai Motor shares fell 2.1% prior to the sales announcement, while Kia Motors stocks dropped 4.1%.

927,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",PBOC Sets Policy Pace for 2020 With Reserve Cut to Aid Credit,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s central bank trimmed the amount of cash that lenders must hold in reserve, and signaled continued action in 2020 to reduce borrowing costs for companies.
The required reserve ratio for commercial lenders will be lowered by 50 basis points from Jan. 6, releasing about 800 billion yuan ($115 billion) of liquidity into the financial system, the People’s Bank of China said on its website Wednesday. The cut aims to help banks reduce their lending rate to businesses, the PBOC said in a separate statement. Currently, the required reserve ratio is 13% for big banks and 11% for smaller ones.
Chinese shares headed for their best start to a year since 2015 on the upcoming cash injection, with the benchmark Shanghai composite index rising by 1.2% to 3,087.16 before the lunch break. The interbank 7-day repo rate dropped below 2.1% as of 1:45p.m., down the most in at least five years.
The move, flagged in advance by Premier Li Keqiang late last month, shows the central bank is sticking to its practice of keeping domestic liquidity conditions relatively supportive amid a broader government drive to shore up the private sector. At the same time, small firms still face hurdles in raising funds, and a recent revamp of the interest rate system is still bedding in, making further efforts likely.
“We expect the PBOC to keep an easing bias by maintaining a measured pace in the rate cut cycle, in addition to RRR cuts,” economists including Li-Gang Liu at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). wrote in a note, adding that policy rates such as the medium-term funding rate will likely drop by 5 to 10 basis points in the first quarter of 2020. “Accommodative monetary policy would support domestic demand, particularly fixed-asset investment.”
The injection will be offset to an extent as banks provide more cash to the public before the Spring Festival later this month, and the overall liquidity level at banks will be kept stable, the central bank said. The “prudent monetary policy stance remains unchanged,” it added.
""With the deceleration in economic growth, policy supports are still needed,"" said Bloomberg Economics' David Qu. ""We continue to expect a 20-30 bps decline in the official one-year loan prime rate for 2020 and think the PBOC will also reduce the interest rate for its medium-term lending facilities.""
The cut is in line with market expectations that the PBOC will increase funding to the financial system in January to ease a possible liquidity crunch caused by rising local government debt sales and increasing cash demand during the Spring Festival holidays. In a statement published earlier Wednesday, the PBOC said it’ll keep monetary policy flexible and work to make credit cheaper for businesses, as the economy still faces strong headwinds.
The reserve cut is timely as local governments resume debt sales Thursday to raise funding for infrastructure projects. The sales started this year earlier than ever, as policy makers front-load such spending to stimulate the economy. In the first batch of issuance, authorities in Sichuan and Henan provinces will offer a combined 87.6 billion yuan of so-called special bonds on Thursday.
China’s manufacturing sector continued to expand output in December, adding to evidence that the world’s second-largest economy is stabilizing as the signing of a phase one trade deal with the U.S. nears.
Uncertain Recovery
Still, a firm overall economic recovery is not for certain, particularly as small and private companies struggle to find cheap funding. The PBOC said the planned reduction will save about 15 billion yuan in funding costs for banks in a year, indicating that the benchmark loan prime rate will likely be lowered as banks reduce their submissions for the rate’s calculation in late January.
If the rate’s recent performance is a guide, the one-year loan prime rate will likely fall by five basis points this month while the five-year rate will be kept unchanged, the same with last September when a similar amount of liquidity was released.
“Looking ahead, there’s still room for more reserve ratio cuts in 2020” to mitigate the impact of deleveraging at small banks, Eva Yi, an economist at China International Capital Corp. in Hong Kong, wrote in a note. “Should economic growth show more signs of stabilization and recovery after the cut, it’s likely the central bank will slow down the pace of further reserve ratio cuts.”"

Insurer   Quilter   (LON:QLT) said it has completed the sale of its life assurance business QLA to ReAssure for 445 million pounds ($558 million), including accrued interest.
The company said it intends to distribute the full net surplus proceeds of 375 million pounds to shareholders. It will decide exactly how and when to do that by its full-year results announcement in March.

Ukrainian-based iron ore miner   Ferrexpo   (LON:FXPO) said it will pay a special dividend of 6.6c a share, in line with a similar payment last year.
That takes total payouts so far to $80 million for the 2019 year, a year in which controlling shareholder Konstantin Zhevago has come under increasing pressure over allegations that the company’s charitable donations were misappropriated.

There’s more disappointment with the drill bit for upstream oil company   Tullow Oil   (LON:TLW), whose shares were among the worst performing in the FTSE 250 in 2019. The company said it will abandon the Carapa-1 well after finding only four meters of net oil pay, less than hoped.
The company took solace from signs that the oil found in the neighboring Stabroek license areas seems to extend southward into the Kanuku block where the Carapa well is located. Tullow holds a 37.5% interest in the block. Spain’s Repsol (MC:REP), which also holds 37.5%, is its operator.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - China has temporarily blocked planned cross-border listings between the Shanghai and London stock exchanges because of political tensions with Britain, five sources told Reuters.
Suspending the Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme casts a shadow over the future of a project meant to build ties between Britain and China, help Chinese firms expand their investor base and give mainland investors access to UK-listed companies.
The sources, who include public officials and people working on potential Shanghai-London deals, all said that politics was behind the suspension.
Two of them highlighted Britain's stance over the Hong Kong protests and one pointed to remarks over the detention of a now former staff member at its consulate in Hong Kong.
All five sources have been involved in talks with Chinese officials and spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about the matter publicly.
British companies and banks involved in the scheme are watching closely how recently-elected Prime Minister Boris Johnson approaches relations with Beijing and what stance he takes on Hong Kong, which has been roiled by protests.
China blames the Hong Kong unrest, heavily supported by an anti-government movement seeking to curb controls by Beijing, on interference by foreign governments including the United States and Britain.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Shanghai Stock Exchange did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) and a spokeswoman for the UK's finance ministry declined to comment.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a faxed statement that it is not aware of the specifics, but added that it ""hopes the UK can provide a fair and unbiased business environment for Chinese companies that invest in the UK and create the appropriate conditions for both countries to carry out practical cooperation smoothly in various fields"".
Stock Connect, which began operating last year, was devised as a way of improving Britain's relationship with the world's second biggest economy and was seen as a major step by China to open up its capital markets as well as linking them globally.
CHINA CHILL
Huatai Securities was the first Chinese company to use the scheme in May, with SDIC Power set to become the second in December with a listing of global depository receipts (GDRs) in London representing 10% of its share capital.
However, the alternative energy operator's deal was postponed at an advanced stage, with SDIC Power citing market conditions as the main reason.
Five sources told Reuters SDIC Power's deal was halted because of Beijing's suspension of Stock Connect.
Other hopefuls such as China Pacific Insurance, which one of the sources said could have launched a deal as early as the first quarter of 2020, have also been told to put their cross-border listing plans on ice, they added.
SDIC Power and China Pacific Insurance did not respond to requests for comment.
""It's not only a big blow to the companies looking to broaden the investor base via listings in London, but also to China's links with global markets,"" one source, who has worked on one of the GDR deals, told Reuters.
Trouble with the scheme comes at a bad time for Britain, which is keen to build ties with non-European Union countries as it prepares to leave the bloc, and the LSE.
The London exchange was set for its worst year in terms of new listings in a decade as of Dec. 4, Refinitiv data showed, with political volatility and concerns over Britain's EU divorce crimping stock market fundraisings."

The California Department of Business Oversight (DBO), which oversees and regulates financial service providers in the state, issued a statement saying it would deny Sezzle's application. 
The company offers U.S. consumers interest-free installment loans of small amounts, targeting younger customers who may not have access to credit cards to purchase products online from participating merchants.
Sezzle works with retailers or merchants who originate credit-sale contracts and then assign those contracts to Sezzle for it to service the payment processing. The company says the buying of those contracts does not constitute loans under state law.
The company said that in order to achieve its goal of eliminating the merchants from the financing process, it was required to apply for a lending license under California Financing Law.
In its statement, DBO said Sezzle's purchasing of credit-sale contracts between merchants and consumers constituted providing loans, for which the company should have already had a lending license.
DBO added that given that Sezzle had violated the California Financing Law by engaging as a lender without the license, its application for the license would now be denied.
""We plan to continue to work with the DBO to correct any issues so that we can proceed with our plans to develop a loan product there,"" the company said in response.
Sezzle added it believed there was a path to resolution, saying a competitor working with a similar model had obtained a license from the department between the dates of Sezzle's application and DBO's statement.
Shares of the company slipped 18.6% to hit their lowest level since being listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in July 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of people killed in large commercial airplane crashes fell by more than 50% in 2019 despite a high-profile Boeing 737 MAX crash in Ethiopia in March, a Dutch consulting firm said on Wednesday.
Aviation consulting firm To70 said there were 86 accidents involving large commercial planes - including eight fatal incidents - resulting in 257 fatalities last year. In 2018, there were 160 accidents, including 13 fatal ones, resulting in 534 deaths, the firm said.
To70 said the fatal accident rate for large airplanes in commercial passenger air transport was just 0.18 fatal accident per million flights in 2019, or an average one fatal accident every 5.58 million flights, a significant improvement over 2018. The fatality numbers include passengers, air crew such as flight attendants and any people on the ground killed in a plane accident
Large passenger airplanes in the study are aircraft used by nearly all travelers on airlines worldwide but excludes small commuter airplanes in service, including the Cessna Caravan and some smaller turboprop airplanes, according to To70.On Dec. 23, Boeing's (N:BA) board said it had fired Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg after a pair of fatal crashes involving the 737 MAX forced it to announce it was halting output of its best-selling jetliner. The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after an October 2018 crash in Indonesia and the crash of a MAX in Ethiopia in March killed a total of 346 people.
To70 said the aviation industry spent significant effort in 2019 ""focusing on so-called 'future threats' such as drones."" But the MAX crashes ""are a reminder that we need to retain our focus on the basics that make civil aviation so safe: well-designed and well-built aircraft flown by fully informed and well-trained crews.""
The Aviation Safety Network said on Wednesday that, despite the MAX crash, 2019 ""was one of the safest years ever for commercial aviation."" The 157 people killed in March on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accounted for more than half of all deaths last year worldwide in passenger airline crashes.
Over the last two decades, aviation deaths around the world have been falling dramatically even as travel has increased. As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said.
In 2017, aviation had its safest year on record worldwide with only two fatal accidents involving regional turboprops that resulted in 13 deaths and no fatal crashes of passenger jets.

937,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2020 12:24PM ET</span>",More drugmakers hike U.S. prices as new year begins,"By Michael Erman
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY),  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD), and Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) hiked U.S. list prices on more than 50 drugs on Wednesday, bringing total New Year's Day drug price increases to more than 250, according to data analyzed by healthcare research firm 3 Axis Advisors.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that drugmakers including  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), GlaxoSmithKline PLC (L:GSK) and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) were planning to increase prices on more than 200 drugs in the United States on Jan. 1. 
Nearly all of the price increases are below 10% and the median price increase is around 5%, according to 3 Axis.
More early year price increases could still be announced.
Soaring U.S. prescription drug prices are expected to again be a central issue in the presidential election. President Donald Trump, who made bringing them down a core pledge of his 2016 campaign, is running for re-election in 2020.
Many branded drugmakers have pledged to keep their U.S. list price increases below 10% a year, under pressure from politicians and patients.
The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other countries where governments directly or indirectly control the costs, making it the world's most lucrative market for manufacturers.
Drugmakers often negotiate rebates on their list prices in exchange for favorable treatment from healthcare payers. As a result, health insurers and patients rarely pay the full list price of a drug.
Bristol-Myers said in a statement it will not raise list prices on its drugs by more than 6% this year. 
The drugmaker raised the price on 10 drugs on Wednesday, including 1.5% price hikes on cancer immunotherapies Opdivo and Yervoy and a 6% increase on its blood thinner Eliquis, all of which bring in billions of dollars in revenue annually.
It also raised the price on Celgene's flagship multiple myeloma drug, Revlimid, 6%. Bristol acquired rival Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) in a $74 billion deal last year.
Gilead raised prices on more than 15 drugs including HIV treatments Biktarvy and Truvada less than 5%, according to 3 Axis. 
Biogen price increases included a 6% price hike on multiple sclerosis treatment Tecfidera, according to 3 Axis.
Gilead and Biogen could not be immediately reached for comment.

3 Axis advises pharmacy industry groups on identifying inefficiencies in the U.S. drug supply chain and has provided consulting work to hedge fund billionaire John Arnold, a prominent critic of high drug prices.

938,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2020 10:58AM ET</span>",Strike not extended at Lufthansa's Germanwings for now,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The trade union representing cabin crew at Lufthansa's (DE:LHAG) budget airline Germanwings decided on Wednesday not to continue their strike for the time being after three days of stoppages led to dozens of flights being canceled.
The Ufo labor union, which called strikes from Monday to Wednesday at Germanwings, will discuss on Sunday how to proceed in the dispute with the company after deciding not to extend the strike, a spokesman said.
The cabin crew strike had led to only 20 of 220 scheduled Germanwings flights taking off in the three days, although Lufthansa subsidiaries like Austrian Airlines has given seats to stranded passengers, limiting the impact on customers.
The deadlocked collective bargaining dispute for the 22,000 cabin employees concerns pay and working conditions among other issues.
Ufo held a strike for two days in November, resulting in the cancellation of one in five flights, affecting around 180,000 passengers and costing the airline up to 20 million euros ($22.42 million)."

960,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Airbus beats goal with 863 jet deliveries in 2019, ousts Boeing from top spot","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has become the world's largest planemaker for the first time since 2011 after delivering a forecast-beating 863 aircraft in 2019, seizing the crown from embattled U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA), airport and tracking sources said on Wednesday.
A reversal in the pecking order between the two giants had been expected as a crisis over Boeing's grounded 737 MAX drags into 2020. But the record European data further underscores the distance Boeing must travel to recoup its market position.
Airbus, which had been forced by its own industrial problems to cut its 2019 delivery goal by 2-3% in October, deployed extra resources until hours before midnight to reach 863 aircraft for the year, compared with its revised target of 860 jets.
Deliveries rose 7.9 % from 800 aircraft in 2018.
Airbus declined to comment on the figures, which must be audited before they can be finalized and published.
Planemakers receive most of their revenues when aircraft are delivered - minus accumulated progress payments - so the end-year delivery performance is closely monitored by investors. 
Airbus's tally, which included around 640 single-aisle aircraft, broke industry records after it diverted thousands of workers and canceled holidays to complete a buffer stock of semi-finished aircraft waiting to have their cabins adjusted.
Airbus has been hit by delays in fitting the complex new layouts on A321neo jets assembled in Hamburg, Germany, resulting in dozens of these and other models being stored in hangars to await last-minute configurations and the arrival of more labor.
Such out-of-sequence work drives up costs and could have a modest impact on Airbus profit margins, but the impact will be largely blunted by the high volume of planes and already solid profitability for such single-aisle aircraft, analysts say.
Still, the problems in fitting complex cabins have curtailed Airbus's ability to take advantage of the market turmoil surrounding Boeing's 737 MAX - grounded since March following two fatal accidents.
Boeing delivered 345 mainly long-haul jets between January and November, less than half the number of 704 achieved in the same period of 2018, when the MAX was being delivered normally. For the whole of 2018, Boeing had delivered 806 aircraft.

Airbus production plants traditionally halt over Christmas and New Year. But the company's delivery centers and completion facilities were humming well into the afternoon of New Year's Eve to allow Asian and other airlines to fly away new jets.

962,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2020 04:02AM ET</span>","Surveillance in a leafy enclave, Ghosn's Tokyo life was under strict monitoring","By Tim Kelly and Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - The imposing home where Carlos Ghosn lived for the last seven months and probably launched a daring escape to avoid Japanese prosecutors is nestled in a leafy enclave of Tokyo where most people pay little attention to Westerners or luxury cars.
Yet neighbors say it was impossible not to notice one of the world's most famous executives, or the black car that seemed to idle nearby whenever he was around - a stark reminder of the surveillance on the ousted Nissan Motor Co chairman while out on bail for financial misconduct charges.
Ghosn on Tuesday said he had fled to Lebanon to escape a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, an astonishing revelation that raises questions about how one of the world's most-recognized businessmen slipped past authorities, especially after he had surrendered his passports under the terms of his bail.
Hana Takeda, who lives in an apartment close to the house where Ghosn has lived since May, said she would sometimes see him out walking with one of his three daughters.
""He wasn't very secretive. I would see him hanging around with his daughter,"" Takeda, 28, told Reuters.
The large, multi-level house is not far from the central Roppongi district in an area popular with diplomats and western executives. 
There is a police presence because of the proximity of at least one embassy and houses for diplomats. Many homes had western luxury cars parked outside, including BMWs, Land Rovers and Bentleys.
Three wireless security cameras peered out from the balcony above the brick porch. Under the terms of his bail, Ghosn had to have cameras installed at the house's entrance.
No one came to the door when a Reuters reporter rang the doorbell. A double garage was shut and net curtains were drawn across the windows. Upper floor windows were covered by blinds.
A policeman on a bicycle made regular rounds through the small neighborhood.
Another neighbor, 62-year-old American Whitney Rich, said he had sometimes noticed a black car near the house.
Ghosn was initially arrested in Tokyo in November 2018 and faces four charges, which he denies. They include hiding income and enriching himself through payments to Middle East dealerships.
It seems unlikely he will now stand trial in Tokyo as Japan has no extradition treaty with Lebanon.
AUDACIOUS ACCOUNT
It was unclear how Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to orchestrate his departure from Japan. He entered Lebanon legally on a French passport, one source has told Reuters.
In one audacious account from Lebanese TV news channel MTV, which Reuters has not been able to verify, a group of musicians arrived at Ghosn's Tokyo house, performed and then packed up their instruments with him inside one of the larger cases. He was then whisked to the airport and out of the country with the help of privately hired security.
What is clear is that Ghosn was tightly monitored - a fact that has made his escape all the more spectacular. Authorities had monitored and restricted his movement and communications to prevent him, they said, from fleeing or tampering with evidence.
There always seemed to be a car at the end of the street near Ghosn's house, said one Western expat who had lived in the area for nine months.
""He kept a low profile... There was a car parked constantly nearby,"" the expat said, declining to be identified.

""He was under constant surveillance.""

Some DRAM and NAND flash chip production lines were stopped after electricity was cut due to a problem with a regional power transmission cable, and a full recovery is expected in about two to three days, Yonhap reported earlier on Tuesday, citing industry sources.
Samsung, the world's top memory chip maker, is inspecting the production lines for a restart, and the extent of the losses is under investigation, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
The incident likely caused millions of dollars in losses, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said, but added that there was no major damage. The source declined to be identified as the exact extent of the damage was not yet public.
A half-hour power outage at Samsung's Pyeongtaek chip plant in 2018 resulted in estimated losses of about 50 billion won ($43.32 million) according to Yonhap.
The incident could help curb the increase of Samsung Electronics' large chip inventory, Yonhap said, citing an analyst."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fatal Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc vehicle in Southern (NYSE:SO) California will be investigated by the U.S. government's auto safety regulator, the agency said on Tuesday.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said earlier this month it had opened an investigation into a 12th Tesla crash that may be tied to the vehicle’s advanced Autopilot driver assistance system after a Tesla Model 3 rear-ended a parked police car in Connecticut.
NHTSA did not say if autopilot was suspected in Sunday's crash in Gardena in Los Angeles county.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Los Angeles television station KTLA reported the driver exited the 91 Freeway in Gardena, ran a red light and struck a 2006 Honda Civic, killing its two occupants.
The two people inside the Tesla were hospitalized but did not have life-threatening injuries, KTLA reported, citing Los Angeles police.
Autopilot had been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles that were involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016. The National Transportation Safety Board has criticized Autopilot's lack of safeguards and said in September in its probe of a 2018 Culver City, California Tesla crash that the system’s design ""permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task.""
Tesla and NHTSA both advise drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot. Tesla says Autopilot ""enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane,"" but does not make the vehicle autonomous.
Some drivers say they are able to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods when using the system. Last month, U.S. Senator Ed Markey said Tesla should disable Autopilot until it installs new safeguards to prevent drivers from evading system limits that could let them fall asleep.

NHTSA has previously confirmed special crash investigations in a number of Tesla crashes but until earlier this month had not disclosed the total number of crashes under review. NHTSA previously investigated another Tesla crash that it initially suspected of being tied to Autopilot but ruled it out.

The debt-laden company filed for bankruptcy with the Qinghai province court in September and halted trading in its shares in November.
After posting net losses in 2017 and 2018, it has said it would be delisted if it reported a net loss for third successive year.
A 24-hour auction on China's Taobao e-commerce site listed equity, shares and debt receivables in two of its subsidiaries, plus fixed assets and inventories, for sale.
The assets were valued at 25.425 billion yuan ($3.64 billion), but drew an opening price of only around 4.27 billion yuan ($612.05 million), according to the auction listings on Taobao.
At the end of the latest auction on Wednesday, Qinghai Salt Lake had garnered no bidders, according to the site. Four previous auctions held in the past month also failed to attract any bids, the company said in a regulatory filing in December.
Investors in the state-owned company include oil-and-chemical conglomerate Sinochem Group.
""Should the company be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, we don't believe this would materially impact its potash business,"" said Humphrey Knight, senior analyst for potash at CRU International.
""However, if this did result in a slowdown in Qinghai Salt Lake's potash production then this would hand the advantage to overseas producers as it could increase China's dependency on potash imports,"" said Knight, adding that China relies on imports of potash, widely used as a fertilizer, for about half its total annual demand."

It did not specify the size of the payment but Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper reported that it was worth $225 million including $150 million in compensation and $75 million covering things such as spare parts and training.
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines crash killed 346 people within five months, costing the plane manufacturer more than $9 billion so far.
Analysts say the full extent of the damage suffered by Boeing's airline customers would depend on the timing of the 737 MAX's return to service, making a settlement between the planemaker and Turkish Airlines noteworthy while the jet remains grounded.
""Either they (Turkish Airlines) have a pretty good feeling for when this will end, or the carrier has somehow lined up alternative capacity to mitigate the damage at this point,"" Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at aviation consulting firm Teal Group said.
With a third of the compensation in the form of future services, the deal also spreads Boeing's cost over the coming years, according to Aboulafia. ""I expect them to take this approach to future settlements,"" he added.
Turkish Airlines had taken delivery of 12 737 MAX planes before the grounding out of 75 it has ordered. It was supposed to have received 12 more since.
In December, a media report had said Turkish Airlines was preparing to open a court case against Boeing in relation to its losses.
Turkish is one of a number of airlines that have been seeking compensation from Boeing for the financial impact of the grounding. 
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, the world's largest 737 MAX operator, said earlier in December that it had reached a confidential agreement with Boeing for a portion of a projected $830 million hit to operating income in 2019.
European charter airline TUI said on Tuesday that it was still in talks with Boeing.
""We're at the negotiating table,"" said spokesman Martin Riecken, adding that TUI hoped to reach a settlement with Boeing but was still considering legal action. TUI was operating 15 of the planes before they were grounded and has another eight on order.
TUI said the grounding cost it 293 million euros ($328.69 million) in its last financial year and the bill could be as high as 400 million euros in the current year depending on when the 737 MAX returns to service.
Last week, Boeing fired CEO Dennis Muilenburg after the company repeatedly failed to contain fallout from the grounding of the 737 MAX, its best-selling jetliner.
Boeing has acknowledged it will not be able to reach its 2019 targets and has announced it would halt 737 MAX production in January.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 09:01PM ET</span>",Tesla must face lawsuit claiming racism at California factory,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A federal judge rejected Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's effort to dismiss claims by two former workers that the California electric car factory where they worked was a hotbed of racial hostility, clearing the way for a possible trial.
In a decision on Monday, U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco found open questions over whether Owen Diaz and his son Demetric Di-az faced ""severe and pervasive racial harassment"" in 2015 and 2016 at Tesla's factory in suburban Fremont, which employs more than 10,000 people.
The plaintiffs, who are black, said they were subjected to repeated racial epithets dozens of times, as well as racist cartoons, and that supervisors engaged in or did little to stop the racism.
Orrick said Diaz could pursue claims that Tesla allowed and did not take reasonable steps to stop racial harassment.
He said punitive damages might be available if Tesla must have known about the harassment and ""ratified"" it, even if only lower level workers were directly involved.
""The n-word is perhaps the most offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English, a word expressive of racial hatred and bigotry,"" Orrick wrote. ""This case will proceed to trial.""
A trial is scheduled for May 11, 2020.
Tesla and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Palo Alto, California-based company has faced multiple racial harassment lawsuits, but is not the only automaker to face such claims in recent years.
In 2017, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co agreed to pay up to $10.1 million to settle a federal probe into alleged harassment at two Chicago plants.
Tesla has in court papers said it ""did not hesitate"" to address racial abuse at the Fremont factory, and there was no proof of ""oppression, malice, or fraud.""
Orrick also said Diaz could pursue claims against a staffing agency that assigned him to the factory, and a liaison between Tesla and that agency.
Lawrence Organ, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said his clients are seeking damages ""in the millions"" of dollars.
""Tesla is not sending a message that this kind of conduct in the workplace is not permitted,"" he said in an interview.
Owen Diaz said he worked at Tesla for 11 months as an elevator operator, while Demetric Di-az spent two months as a production associate.
Allegations included a claim that Diaz's supervisor admitted to drawing a cartoon of ""a black face person with a bone in his hair"" and captioned ""booo,"" supposedly short for ""jigaboo.""
""You people can't take a joke,"" Diaz said the supervisor told him.

The case is Di-az et al v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-06748.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 07:11PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Drugmakers from Pfizer to GSK to hike U.S. prices on over 200 drugs,"By Michael Erman and Carl O'Donnell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers including  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), GlaxoSmithKline PLC (L:GSK) and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) are planning to hike U.S. list prices on more than 200 drugs in the United States on Wednesday, according to drugmakers and data analyzed by healthcare research firm 3 Axis Advisors.
Nearly all of the price increases will be below 10%, and around half of them are in the range of 4 to 6%, said 3 Axis co-founder Eric Pachman. The median price increase is around 5%, he said.
More price increases are expected to be announced later this week, which could affect the median and range.
Soaring U.S. prescription drug prices are expected to again be a central issue in the presidential election. President Donald Trump, who made bringing them down a core pledge of his 2016 campaign, is running for re-election in 2020.
Many branded drugmakers have pledged to keep their U.S. list price increases below 10% a year, under pressure from politicians and patients.
Drugmakers often negotiate rebates on their list prices in exchange for favorable treatment from healthcare payers. As a result, health insurers and patients rarely pay the full list price of a drug.
Pfizer will hike prices on more than 50 drugs, including its cancer treatment Ibrance, which is on track to bring in nearly $5 billion in revenue this year, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz. 
Pfizer spokeswoman Amy Rose confirmed the company's planned price increases. She said the company plans to increase the list prices on around 27% of its portfolio in the United States by an average of 5.6%. 
Of the medicines with increases, she said 43% of them are sterile injectibles, and many of those increases are less than $1 per product.
GlaxoSmithKline said it will raise prices on more than 30 drugs. The company will raise prices on the blockbuster respiratory treatments it delivers through its Ellipta inhaler, its recently acquired cancer drug Zejula and on several products in its HIV-focused ViiV joint venture, according to 3 Axis Advisors. Price increases ranged between 1% and 5%.
Sanofi said it will raise prices on around 10 of its drugs, with hikes ranging between 1% and 5%. The drugmaker noted the increases are in line with its commitment to not raise prices above medical inflation. 
Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) raised prices on more than 15 drugs, in some cases by more than 6%, according to 3 Axis Advisors. A Teva spokesperson said the company regularly reviews prices in the context of market conditions, availability and cost of production.
3 Axis advises pharmacy industry groups on identifying inefficiencies in the U.S. drug supply chain and has provided consulting work to hedge fund billionaire John Arnold, a prominent critic of high drug prices.
STAYING OUT OF THE CROSSHAIRS?
Ian Spatz, a senior adviser at consulting firm Manatt Health, said that drugmakers could be holding to relatively low price hikes in an attempt to stay out of politicians' crosshairs. Trump, for instance, targeted Pfizer after a proposed round of price increases in 2018, saying in a tweet that the drugmaker ""should be ashamed.""
""I’m sure many manufacturers are interested in making sure they are not called out on a large list price increase,"" Spatz said.
The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other countries where governments directly or indirectly control the costs, making it the world's most lucrative market for manufacturers.
Trump, a Republican, has struggled to deliver on a pledge to lower drug prices before the November 2020 election. His administration recently proposed a rule to allow states to import prescription drugs from Canada.
The administration had previously scrapped an ambitious policy that would have required health insurers to pass billions of dollars in rebates they receive from drugmakers to Medicare patients.

The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, passed a bill earlier in December that would cap prices for the country's most expensive drugs based on international prices and penalize drugmakers that do not negotiate with the Medicare insurance program for seniors. Trump has threatened to veto the bill, saying it would undermine access to lifesaving medicines.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes edged higher on Tuesday on a renewed rally fueled by trade optimism, capping off a decade of handsome returns in which the benchmark S&P 500 rose nearly 190%.
Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq notched their biggest annual percentage gains since 2013, while the Dow closed 2019 with its biggest yearly percentage gain since 2017. In 2019, the current bull run in U.S. stocks became the longest one on record as trade optimism, dovish monetary policy and an improving economic outlook fueled sharp gains.
On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said on Twitter that the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House, bolstering widespread expectations of a finalized preliminary agreement in early 2020. That development was offset, however, by news of violent protests outside the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
The session's modest gains marked a turnaround from Monday, when the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted their biggest daily percentage losses in nearly four weeks. U.S. stocks had become overbought, and Monday's declines helped make room for future gains, said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell in New York.
""It helps to have two steps forward, one step back,"" he said. ""It helps sustain the rally.""
Volume was somewhat lower than usual, with 5.99 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.84 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) on Thursday expects to ship 1.9 million gifts and other items back to U.S. retailers as e-commerce fuels an anticipated 26% year-over-year volume surge on ""National Returns Day.""
Jan. 2 is the busiest day for holiday returns in the United States. U.S. shoppers return more packages than their peers around the globe, spurred by free shipping on orders and returns - costly perks that squeeze retailer profits.
About 10% of goods sold in the United States go back to retailers every year, resulting in roughly $369 billion in lost sales, according to a 2018 report from Appriss Retail and National Retail Federation.
Apparel is an outsized contributor. Returns in some categories approach 50% due to inconsistent sizing across brands, said Greg Buzek, founder and president of IHL Group, a research and advisory firm.
""That causes great expense for retailers,"" said Buzek, who estimated that annual global losses from retail returns are nearly $1 trillion – up from $600 billion in 2015.
A new crop of startups aims to take the bite out of returns.
Los Angeles-based Happy Returns promises to slash returns-related expenses up to 30% by reducing shipping costs and customer support calls.
It has 700 ""return bars"" in U.S. retail stores and shopping malls, where customers drop off items and arrange refunds or exchanges. The company charges retailers a flat fee for every item it processes.
""You have to have some free (return) option. Nobody said it had to be the mail,"" said Happy Returns Chief Executive David Sobie.
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) also encourages shoppers to return products to its own physical stores or Kohl's (N:KSS) locations, where eligible items are packed and shipped for free.
While 30% of shoppers return items to stores, more than twice that many opt for shipping, according to UPS' 2019 Pulse of the Online Shopper report. UPS said it handled more than 1 million returns each day in December, but declined to give an annual total.
UPS and home furnishing retailer IKEA are among the investors in Optoro Inc, which helps retailers sort, resell and dispose of returned merchandise more efficiently.
The aim is to prevent products from sitting in a back room losing value or getting routed and rerouted at great expense, said Larisa Summers, Optoro's senior vice president of e-commerce.
""You have to welcome these goods back, otherwise customers won't shop with you the first time,"" Summers said."

The fallen automotive titan was supposed to be facing trial for financial crimes in Tokyo where he’s been detained for more than a year. But late on Monday it emerged that he’d escaped the Japanese authorities to take refuge in Lebanon.
It’s his next move that could make life awkward.
Ghosn’s wife Carole told Bloomberg Television last month that he wants to be tried in France, where he holds citizenship. If he landed in Paris that would complicate the relationship between France and Japan at a moment when President Emmanuel Macron is trying to shore up the Renault-Nissan auto alliance. France has a policy to never extradite its citizens outside the European Union.
Even in Lebanon, where France has close diplomatic ties, officials in Paris have an obligation to provide some support to the fugitive and risk being drawn into his dispute with the humiliated Japanese.
“If a foreign citizen was escaping French justice, we would be very angry,” Junior Economy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told France Inter radio. “On the other hand, he’s a Lebanese, Brazilian and French citizen, and he has the right to consular support, like all French people.”
Pannier-Runacher’s comments typify the balancing act French officials have tried to pull off since Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo more than a year ago: respect for the Japanese sovereignty and for the ongoing legal procedure, while providing a base-level of support for a man who tangled with the French government, his largest shareholder, more than once while at the helm of  Renault  (PA:RENA).
French officials are wary of any moves that might antagonize the Japanese as they try to protect a relationship that is vital to one of the country’s most important manufacturers. Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said in a Wall Street Journal interview published on Dec. 25 that fixing the alliance was a matter of survival.
After leading Nissan and Renault for most of their two-decade partnership, Ghosn’s downfall exposed governance shortfalls at Nissan and brought long-standing tensions between the automakers to the fore, particularly regarding their capital structure in the partnership. Nissan’s new chief executive officer said this month that he is looking at what works and what doesn’t in the alliance, stressing that the partnership needs to benefit all parties.
“What interests us is the future of Renault and Nissan, and the alliance,” Pannier-Runacher said Tuesday. “We have turned the page, and today there is good work being done at the alliance.”
In an emailed statement following his escape, Ghosn said he refused to be “held hostage” by Japan’s “rigged” justice system any longer. But if he were to travel to France, the authorities might also bring him in for questioning as part of their own probe into his spending and potential misuse of corporate funds.
With his history of cutting jobs, Ghosn could also prove a lightning rod for criticism by unions already battling Macron over plans to modernize the pension system.“Once more, Ghosn has given himself the license to decide what is a matter of justice or not, just as he gave himself license to fire hundreds of thousands of employees, without any fair hearing,” Fabien Gache, a representative of the automotive branch of the far-left CGT union, said in a statement after the escape.
It took the French foreign affairs ministry more than 12 hours to come up with its response. Officials were unaware of the details of his escape, they said.
“I thought France was a country that defended the presumption of innocence. They’ve all forgotten everything Carlos did for France’s economy and for Renault,” Carole Ghosn told Journal du Dimanche in October. “All we’re asking for is the respect of his human rights and his right to defend himself, to a fair and quick trial in Japan or in France, where he is a citizen.”"
975,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 11:36AM ET</span>","Google to end 'Double Irish, Dutch sandwich' tax scheme","By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) will no longer use an intellectual property licensing scheme, known as the ""Double Irish, Dutch sandwich"", which allowed it to delay paying U.S. taxes, 2018 tax filings show.
A Google spokesman on Tuesday confirmed it would scrap the licensing structure, saying this was in line with international rules and followed changes to U.S. tax law in 2017.
Dutch filings, which were seen by Reuters, showed that in 2018 Google moved 21.8 billion euros ($24.5 billion) through its Dutch holding company to Bermuda, up from 19.9 billion in 2017. Google said it would end the practice after 2019.
""A date of termination of the Company's licensing activities has not yet been conﬁrmed by senior leadership, however management expects that this termination will take place as of 31 December 2019 or during 2020,"" the Dutch filing said.
""Consequently, the Company's turnover and associated expense base generated from licensing activities will discontinue as of this date,"" the filing with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce added.
Google, like other multinationals that make use of international tax minimization strategies, has always said it pays all its taxes.
""We're now simplifying our corporate structure and will license our IP (intellectual property) from the US, not Bermuda,"" a spokesman said in a statement.
""Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years, our global effective tax rate has been over 23%, with more than 80% of that tax due in the US.”
For more than a decade, Dutch, Irish and U.S. tax law allowed Google to enjoy an effective tax rate in the single digits on its non-U.S. profits, around a quarter the average tax rate in its overseas markets.
The subsidiary in the Netherlands was used to shift revenue from royalties earned outside the United States to Google Ireland Holdings, an affiliate based in Bermuda, where companies pay no income tax.
The tax strategy was legal and allowed Google to avoid triggering U.S. income taxes or European withholding taxes on the funds, which represent the bulk of its overseas profits.
Under pressure from the European Union and the United States, Ireland in 2014 decided to phase out the arrangement, ending Google's Irish tax advantages in 2020.
The Trump administration's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which came into effect in January 2018, ended the reason for U.S. companies to hoard foreign profits offshore. Now profits that have been made and taxed abroad are not subject to taxation when returned to the U.S. 
In the Bermuda filing for 2018, Bermuda-based ""Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Co."" said in the future it would no longer continue licensing intellectual property or holding debt securities, but it would continue equity investment operations.

976,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 11:08AM ET</span>",Ghosn says he escaped 'injustice' in Japan; Lebanon calls arrival a private matter,"By Issam Abdallah and Tim Kelly
BEIRUT/TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn said on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, raising questions about how one of the world's most-recognized executives had slipped away while on bail.
Ghosn's abrupt departure marks the latest twist in a year-old saga that has shaken the global auto industry, jeopardised the alliance of Nissan Motor Co Ltd and top shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and increased scrutiny of Japan's judicial system.
""I am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied,"" Ghosn, 65, said in a brief statement on Tuesday.
""I have not fled justice - I have escaped injustice and political persecution. I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.""
Tokyo officials have previously said the system is not inhumane and that Ghosn, who is facing trial on financial misconduct charges he denies, has been treated like any other suspect.
It was unclear how Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to orchestrate his departure from Japan. He had been under strict surveillance by authorities while out on bail and had surrendered his passports.
According to a senior Lebanese foreign ministry source, Ghosn entered Lebanon legally on a French passport and using his Lebanese ID with normal security procedures. People familiar with the matter told Reuters he had arrived in Beirut on a private jet from Istanbul on Monday.
The French and Lebanese foreign ministries both said they were unaware of the circumstances of his journey. ""All discussion of it is his private matter,"" the Lebanese ministry added.
Lebanon's state security directorate said Ghosn will not face any legal consequences for the way he entered the country, state NNA news agency reported. The foreign ministry said Lebanon did not have a judicial cooperation agreement with Japan.
Japanese authorities had no record of Ghosn leaving, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said. A person resembling him entered Beirut international airport under a different name, NHK reported, citing an unidentified Lebanese security official.
His lawyers were still in possession of his three passports, one of his lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters.
Hironaka, in comments broadcast live on NHK, said the first he had heard of Ghosn's departure was on the news this morning and that he was surprised. He also said it was ""inexcusable behaviour"".
Japan has extradition treaties with only the United States and South Korea, according to the justice ministry, meaning it could be difficult to force Ghosn to return to stand trial.
While his arrest on financial misconduct charges last year ensured a dramatic fall from grace in Japan, he retains more popularity in Lebanon, where billboards saying ""We are all Carlos Ghosn"" were erected in his support and he was previously featured on a postage stamp.
Born in Brazil of Lebanese ancestry, Ghosn grew up in Beirut and has retained close ties to Lebanon.
At Ghosn’s gated villa in the Achrafieh neighborhood of Beirut, a handful of police and private security personnel stood guard on Tuesday. 
A man who identified himself only as his English neighbor walked by to leave a card, with the words “Carlos, welcome home!” written inside. It was not immediately clear if Ghosn was at the address. 
""It's a good thing that at last he's out of being locked up for something which he may or may not -- probably not -- have done,"" said the neighbor.
A French minister said before the report Ghosn used a French passport that she was ""very surprised"" by news of his emergence in Lebanon.
FLIGHT RISK
Ghosn was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018, shortly after his private jet touched down at the airport. He faces four charges - which he denies - including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.
Nissan sacked him as chairman saying internal investigations revealed misconduct including understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5 million of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest.
The case sparked international criticism of Japan's justice system, in which 99.9 percent of people charged with crimes are convicted and defence lawyers are prohibited from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.
Ghosn was initially released in March on a record $9 million bail only to be arrested on related charges weeks later and then released on bail again at the end of April.
His movement and communications have been monitored and restricted to prevent his fleeing the country and tampering with evidence, the Tokyo District court previously said.
The terms of his bail have also been striking by Western standards. He has been prevented from communicating with his wife, Carole, and had his use of the internet and other communications curtailed.
Carole is now with him in Lebanon at a house with armed guards outside, the New York Times reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. 
HOUSE ARREST
Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was ""tired of being an industrial political hostage"", one person told The Wall Street Journal. 
A person familiar with Nissan's thinking told Reuters: ""I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court.""
The trial was widely expected to start in April. Ghosn's Japanese lawyers have fought, so far unsuccessfully, to get access to 6,000 pieces of evidence collected from Nissan, which they say is crucial to a fair trial. 
Ghosn has said he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of ""backstabbing"" and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing closer ties between the Japanese automaker and its biggest shareholder Renault, of which Ghosn was also chairman.
His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover by Renault.
Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP). In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround that won him the nickname ""Le Cost Killer.""

After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, Ghosn used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business super-star status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A rise in large mergers and acquisitions (M&A) helped offset a plunge in cross-border deals in 2019, and many dealmakers say they expect subsiding geopolitical risk to embolden companies to pursue more tie-ups across regions in 2020.
The value of M&A globally totaled about $3.9 trillion in 2019, making it the fourth strongest year for dealmaking, according to preliminary figures published by financial data provider Refinitiv. This is only slightly lower than the $3.96 trillion in deals recorded in 2018.
Cross-border M&A totaled $1.2 trillion, down 25% year-on-year to its lowest level since 2013, as rising geopolitical uncertainty and regulatory scrutiny of deals made many corporate chiefs and boards wary of expanding beyond their home markets.
""Companies were more comfortable this year doing deals within their own regions given the macroeconomic risks such the trade tariffs and Brexit, so cross-border M&A was down,"" said JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) global M&A co-head Chris Ventresca.
Large deals, on the other hand, were on the rise, as companies were spurred on by their strong stock performance and cheap financing to pursue transformative acquisitions.
The number of M&A transactions worth more than $10 billion increased 8% year-on-year to 43 this year, their highest level since 2015, according to Refinitiv. Some 21 deals, each worth more than $20 billion, accounted for almost a quarter of global volume in 2019.
""Mega-deals were the main feature of this year's deal-making, especially in the United States, where the bulk of these transactions took place,"" said  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) global M&A co-head Gilberto Pozzi.
The biggest deals of the year included U.S. drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (N:BMY) $74 billion acquisition of  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG); U.S. defense contactor Raytheon Co's (N:RTN) merger with the aerospace business of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) into a $135 billion company; and U.S. pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc's (N:ABBV) $64 billion purchase of Botox maker Allergan Plc (N:AGN).
The United States accounted for close to half of global M&A volume in 2019, with $1.8 trillion worth of deals announced, up 6% from a year ago. Europe and Asia tied for a distant second, with a little over $740 billion worth of M&A transactions announced in each region.
""Europe has been hit by macroeconomic headwinds in key markets, including Britain, Germany and France, where Brexit uncertainty, slow growth and social unrest have been some of the main hurdles,"" said Pier Luigi Colizzi,  Barclays  Plc's (L:BARC) head of M&A for Europe and the Middle East.
In Britain, Europe's largest M&A market, dealmaking dropped 4% year-on-year to $220.6 billion, with much of the year dominated by political debate over when and how Britain will leave the European Union.
""Market uncertainty in the UK has played in favor of private equity funds, which have been very active and have carried out a number of take-private deals, including Merlin Entertainments, Sophos and Cobham,"" said Cyrus Kapadia, chief executive officer of Lazard Ltd's (N:LAZ) British operations.
In Asia, China's economic slowdown led to M&A volume in the country dropping 14% year-on-year to $380.3 billion, while the political turmoil fueled by Hong Kong's pro-democracy turmoils unnerved dealmakers in the wider region.
ROOM FOR M&A TO PICK UP
After world stocks added over $25 trillion in value in the past decade, and a bond rally put $13 trillion worth of bond yields below zero, some investors have been asking whether a recession could be around the corner that would put the brakes on the wave of dealmaking.
Yet companies have not been holding back on M&A because of concerns about an economic slowdown, deal advisers say.
""The next economic downturn is not expected to be as severe as the 2008 financial crisis, and when it happens many well-capitalized companies may seek to capitalize on a drop in corporate valuations to pursue their dream deals,"" said Perella Weinberg Partners Chief Executive Officer Peter Weinberg.
The U.S. economy grew 2.9% in 2018, but forecasts for 2019 are for around 2.5% growth, due to the fading impact of U.S. President Donald Trump administration's tax-cut package and slowing global growth. At this level, dealmakers say the environment would be conducive for more transactions.
""A lukewarm economy is ideal for acquisitions, because companies need M&A to ensure growth, and business sentiment is sufficiently strong for CEOs and boards to be comfortable with pursuing deals,"" said Sullivan & Cromwell LLP partner Frank Aquila.
Moreover, some of the geopolitical risks that weighed on cross-border M&A in 2019 are gradually dissipating. The United States and China are close to signing their Phase 1 trade deal, while a strong electoral victory for Britain's Conservative Party earlier this month offered clarity on the country's timetable for Brexit.
""About a month and a half ago, activity levels started to pick up, and it seems people feel a lot better about the M&A pipeline,"" said Alan Klein, co-head of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP's M&A practice.
Despite the boom in dealmaking over the last few years, global M&A volumes are below their long-term average when viewed against the value of equity markets or global economic growth. Some deal advisers cite this to argue M&A volumes are not close to reaching a ceiling.
""In real terms, we have a good but not great level of M&A activity, with the potential for upside,"" said  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) global co-head of M&A Cary Kochman."

981,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 08:27AM ET</span>",Tencent gets into global groove with stake in Vivendi's Universal,"By Sudip Kar-Gupta and Kane Wu
PARIS/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Tencent-led consortium is taking a 10% stake in Vivendi's Universal Music Group, valuing the music label that houses Lady Gaga and The Beatles at 30 billion euros ($34 billion) and giving the Chinese firm a global backstage pass.
The deal allows both companies to expand in a recovering global music market, giving Tencent more access to U.S. artists while UMG can tap into the Asian market, including big-selling ""K-Pop"" Korean pop stars.
After months of talks, French media conglomerate  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) said on Tuesday it had finalised the sale of an initial 10% of the world's largest music label to the Tencent consortium, which also had the option to buy up to 10% more by January 2021 on the same price basis.
Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bollore, is seeking to cash in on the music industry's revival, driven by a growing subscription and ad-based music streaming services and the deal gives UMG an enterprise value of 30 billion euros.
The initial deal would soon be followed by a second one allowing Tencent Music Entertainment (N:TME) to buy a minority stake in UMG's greater China subsidiary.
Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Vivendi did not disclose the details of the consortium beyond saying they were ""global financial investors"".
Singapore's state investment firm GIC and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) were also involved, a source familiar with the deal told Reuters. QIA declined to comment and GIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
RISING TEMPO 
The IFPI federation said in April that global recorded music revenues had risen 9.7% in 2019 from last year, while Universal was Vivendi's main third quarter sales growth driver, with revenues rising nearly 16% to 1.8 billion euros.
""Universal has been enjoying increased revenues for the last 5 years. With the company in a strong position, it can make sense to capitalise on the valuation with a minority sale at this point in the growth cycle,"" said MB Capital director Marcus Bullus, commenting on the deal.
The tie-up between Tencent and Vivendi builds on a partnership struck two years ago, allowing Tencent to license Universal's music for distribution over its streaming platforms.
Vivendi said in July last year it might sell up to half of UMG and any cash raised from a divestment could help finance a share buyback or acquisitions.
The transaction should also boost morale among Chinese deal-makers, with China-outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity plunging to a 10-year low amid trade tensions between the United States and China, Refinitiv data shows.
In November,  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue.
Although Tencent Music's user base is nearly three times that of Spotify (N:SPOT), which is the world's largest music streaming service, its paying users are comparatively fewer.
Spotify, in which the Tencent Holding company (HK:0700) itself has a minority stake, had more than 100 million paid subscribers, whereas Tencent Music had about 35 million as of the third quarter. 
Vivendi shares closed up 0.3%, with the final sale terms in line with earlier guidance from Vivendi.
MB Capital's Bullus said it was unclear how Vivendi would use the cash and ""how this will increase value for existing shareholders now potentially left with cash in their pocket but a smaller stake in a growing cash generating company"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Global equities drifted on Tuesday while the dollar ended 2019 on a subdued note following a buoyant year of stock market gains, driven in recent weeks by hopes of an imminent U.S.-China trade deal.
MSCI's global share index was treading water but is on track for a 24% rise in 2019 - the index's best performance in almost a decade.
In Europe, equity markets were mixed, with Britain's FTSE (FTSE) slipping 0.4% while France's CAC (FCHI) was little changed in thin trading. Germany's DAX was closed.
Bourses in Asia also diverged. China mainland stocks (CSI300) (SSEC) gained 0.4% after data showed manufacturing activity in the world's second largest economy expanded for a second straight month in December.
The data added too optimism that trade tensions were easing between Beijing and Washington after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday a Phase 1 deal would likely be signed in the next week. He cited a report that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He would visit the United States this week.
""This is the second print above 50 since the PMI dropped into contraction in May this year and could be early tentative signs of stabilisation of the sector,"" MUFG's Lee Hardman wrote in a note to clients.
""It is worth remembering however that the Phase One trade deal (which has not even been officially signed) has only recently become a more certain prospect and that it may still take some time for a rekindling of sentiment and investment to be reflected in the economic data.""
China's gains built on Monday's rally, which was driven by a combination of strong retail sales growth and hopes that a new benchmark for floating-rate loans could lower borrowing costs.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong stocks (HSI) fell 0.5% as protesters geared up for pro-democracy rallies on New Year's Eve.
Markets in Japan and South Korea were closed for a holiday.
Following losses on Wall Street on Monday, U.S. stock futures showed some optimism ahead of the final session of the year, with S&P 500 e-minis up 0.1%.

(Reuters) - European shares looked set to end the decade with a whimper on Tuesday as investors locked in gains after a record rally that was fueled by optimism around trade and easing fears of a global recession.
In a shortened session ahead of the New Year's Eve celebrations, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) shed 0.3%.
French (FCHI), British (FTSE) and Spanish (IBEX) stocks lost between 0.4% and 0.8%, while Frankfurt and Milan bourses were shut for the year-end holidays.
""While market volumes are predictably light, investors continue to strike a year-end cautionary tone as December optimism is gradually giving way to 2020's uncertainty,"" Stephen Innes, a market strategist at AxiTrader, wrote in a note.
Global equities notched multiple record highs in December as investors cheered a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade negotiations and signs of a smoother Brexit. [MKTS/GLOB]
The upbeat mood, coupled with robust economic data and a relatively loose monetary policy by the world's most influential central banks, have set the benchmark European index on course for its biggest annual gain since the global financial crisis.
But with the finer details about the Phase 1 trade deal not yet known, analysts say scepticism is building around how long the truce will last.
""Once the (Phase 1) deal is signed, investors will then press to consider ... how much more progress can be realistically expected ahead of the US elections next year,"" Innes said.
For European investors, Brexit clouds are gathering again.
Although Britain's exit from the European Union is now almost certain on Jan. 31, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's hard line on the country's future trade relationship with the bloc has again fanned fears of a no-deal Brexit.
Traders will also be looking at Germany for concrete signs of economic growth, after Europe's powerhouse teetered on the brink of recession this year.
Despite equities in the country being highly sensitive to trade progress, German shares rose only 0.1% in December, widely underperforming their regional peers.
For the year, the STOXX 600 rose about 23%, but lagged both the wider MSCI world index (MIWD00000PUS) and the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX).

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global fund managers kept their recommendations largely steady in December, with a preference for equities turned down slightly despite a rally in world stocks, which has set the S&P 500 on course for its best year since 2013, a Reuters poll showed.
Easing trade-war worries on hopes of an U.S.-China trade agreement have lifted global equities this month, putting MSCI's global equity index (MIWD00000PUS) on track for the fourth straight month of gains.
But the Reuters monthly survey of 37 asset managers around the globe, taken Dec. 11-30, showed equity allocations accounted for an average 47.0% of the global portfolio, down from 47.5% in November.
Bond holdings were increased to 42.1% from 41.8%. Cash remained 4.6%.
Asset managers in recent months had increased their preference for stocks to obtain better returns, but with few major updates expected on the U.S.-China trade agreement before the new year, they preferred to stick to a defensive holding pattern in December, as they have for much of this year.
""While we are still awaiting finer details of the initial trade agreement between the world's top two economies, there remains some lingering doubts about how long the truce will last,"" said a global chief investment officer at a large fund.

987,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 02:11AM ET</span>","China outbound M&A plummets to 10-year low on trade tensions, economic slowdown","By Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&As) clocked their weakest year in a decade in 2019, as an escalated U.S.-China trade war and tightened regulatory scrutiny of Chinese companies impacted appetite for overseas dealmaking.
Chinese acquirers announced $41 billion in outbound deals this year, nearly halving from 2018 and less than a fifth of the 2016 peak, showed data from Refinitiv. The number was only slightly higher than 2009 when dealmaking plunged after the financial crisis.
Outbound deals into the United States dropped 80% this year from last to $2 billion.
The fall came in a year in which the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which reviews deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security risks, started to retrospectively review deals. That led to Chinese firm Kunlun selling gay dating app Grindr due to fears surrounding data security.
""The top concern of Chinese investors is potential geopolitical pushback,"" said Yuxin Shen, a Beijing-based M&A partner at law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. ""Unless there is a compelling reason, we don't see much Chinese interest in U.S. assets these days.""
At home, Chinese companies - which used to borrow heavily to fund overseas purchases - are under pressure to cut debt as economic growth slows and capital controls remain tight.
Fitch Ratings in December said a record 4.9% of private issuers of onshore bonds had defaulted on payments in the first 11 months of 2019. Capital controls have also made it difficult for mainland firms to pay off offshore debt.
HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL], once China's dealmaking champion, has been shedding assets to pay off debt, while Shandong Ruyi Woolen Garment Group Co Ltd (SZ:002193), which bought a series of overseas fashion brands in recent years, is also struggling to refinance debt piled up from acquisitions.
Overall, deals involving Asia-Pacific firms worldwide fell to $1.06 trillion from $1.4 trillion in 2018.
Bankers expect Chinese state-owned companies to play a major role in dealmaking next year, with interest seen in traditional sectors such as mining and infrastructure.
Divestment by multi-national companies and corporate restructuring could also bring more deals within China, bankers said.
""The biggest issue in China is uncertainty which makes investors reluctant to make big commitments and assets hard to price,"" said Jonathan Zhu, a managing director at buyout firm Bain Capital. ""We will likely see more domestically driven M&A activities in China next year, but fewer cross-border deals."""

Caps on foreign ownerships of futures companies will be scrapped as of 1 January 2020, as part of the gradual opening up of China's financial sector to foreign players. 
China's futures industry is currently dominated by local players. 
A filing to the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) dated Dec. 25 showed that J.P. Morgan Futures Co. had applied to make a change of more than 5% in its shareholding structure, though did not give any further details. 
If the U.S. bank is able to increase its stake, it would be the first foreign player to have majority ownership of its China futures business. 
The CSRC announced in October a firm timetable for next year's opening up of its securities brokerage and mutual fund sectors, as well as its futures industry. 
UBS (S:UBSG) became the first foreign bank to reach 51% ownership of its China securities joint venture under the new rules in late 2018.
JPMorgan received final approval earlier this month to set up a majority owned securities JV, and, in August, purchased the shares needed for a majority equity stake in its Chinese asset management joint venture, pending regulatory approval. 
JP Morgan was not immediately available for a request seeking comment.

989,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 10:17PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Markets Show Optimism Is Riding High Into 2020,"(Bloomberg) -- After a year framed by local unrest and the U.S.-China trade war, investors in Hong Kong’s financial markets are more sanguine going into 2020.
The city’s Hang Seng Index has rallied 7.1% in December, among the world’s top major benchmarks. Elevated local borrowing costs have put the Hong Kong dollar on pace for its best month since 2003 even as some analysts doubt the strength will stick.
Worries are still hanging over the city after its economy plunged into recession, and as protests continue following a landslide for pro-democracy candidates in November. But for Hong Kong markets, helping sentiment this month was an initial trade agreement between Washington and Beijing which helped power a return to risk assets globally and sent the S&P 500 to new all-time highs in the U.S.
The Hang Seng Index lost 0.4% on Tuesday on volume that was 21% lower than the 30-day average.
“It’s been a worse-than-expected year for Hong Kong’s financial markets due to the political events,” said Sam Chi Yung, a Hong Kong-based strategist with Springwaters Financial Group Co. “Since the city’s tension has eased recently and more trade deals are expected to be signed next year, the market is set for a good start in 2020. Yung is expecting a “good rebound” for the Hang Seng in the first half.
Despite the December rally, the Hong Kong benchmark is still trailing most major stock indexes around the world this year. After the Hang Seng’s strong start to 2019, occurring as mainland equities surged, markets were hit by inflamed trade tensions, an extended drop in the yuan and worsening economic data in China. Chinese firms account for more than half the market value of Hang Seng components.
Here’s What Analysts Say About Hong Kong Stocks for 2020
While there’s anticipation the year-end rally for equities can persist, some market watchers believe the Hong Kong dollar’s 0.5% gain for December will prove short-lived. That as the currency is about to end a year in the strong half of its trading band for the first time since 2016.
Longest Hong Kong Dollar Rally in Eight Years Is Burning Shorts
Local interbank lending rates have been elevated since November, triggered by what many consider a transitory surge in demand for cash, such as banks hoarding funds for regulatory checks at the end of the year. The higher rates helped outstrip the income a trader can expect from U.S. dollars, undermining the so-called carry trade. Investors selling the city’s dollars and buying greenbacks has been a profitable move for years.
“The Hong Kong dollar should weaken past the year-end, as local interest rates should soften,” said Stephen Chiu, an Asia foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “A more sustained retreat in Hong Kong rates and the city’s currency could come after” the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, he added. Then, too, typically sees a seasonal increase for cash.

China’s official manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) showed a positive reading for the second month in a row and slightly ahead of expectations. The manufacturing PMI by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) produced a reading for December of 50.2, in line with the November reading. 
Chinese manufacturing activity will remain a focus for traders ahead of January, when a phase one trade deal between the U.S. and China is expected to be signed. There are some that are ringing a word of caution, however. 
“The U.S.-China trade war is far from resolved. Negotiations continue over the details of a phase one deal, but policy makers acknowledge many thorny issues remain,” Hannah Anderson, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management said in a note quoted by Bloomberg. “Returns will depend on just how tolerant investors can be of their fears in a low growth world.” 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.23%.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, in an interview on Fox News, cited a report that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He would visit this week to sign the deal, but did not confirm it.
""Washington has sent an invitation and Beijing has accepted it,"" the South China Morning Post on Monday quoted a source as saying. 
Representatives for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report, which said the Chinese delegation was likely to stay in the United States until the middle of next week.
""Never believe reports on anonymous sources. Get it from President Trump or ... (U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer,"" Navarro told Fox.
""We'll probably have a signing on that within the next week or so - we're just waiting for the translation,"" he added.
Hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal helped keep world stocks positive on Monday, although neither side has released many specific details of the agreement, and no text has been released yet.
Navarro said the deal would be made public ""as quickly as possible,"" and that he did no expect any snags to hold it up. ""Basically you need to get it translated into the Chinese and double-checked so both versions match,"" he added. 
The 86-page agreement includes details on intellectual property, ""a good start"" on forced technology transfers and ""some good language on currency manipulation,"" Navarro said.
Trump first announced plans for the initial trade pact in October, and U.S. and Chinese negotiators have spent weeks finalizing the so-called Phase 1 deal, which comes in lieu of the massive trade agreement that the world's two largest economies had initially sought.
Lighthizer this month said representatives from both countries would sign the pact during the first week of January.
Last week, Trump told reporters he and Chinese President Xi Jinping would eventually have a signing ceremony for the agreement. Trump gave no further details, but said the deal was done and being translated.

Days earlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the deal was finished but was undergoing a technical review.

The cap on default electricity and gas bills came into effect in January this year and was a flagship policy of former British Prime Minister Theresa May to end what she called ""rip-off"" prices.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said in a statement that ""11 million customers have saved as much as 1 billion pounds on their energy bills in 2019, according to new data.""
The cap, which in October was set at 1,179 pounds ($1,550) per year for average dual fuel consumption of gas and electricity, is set on energy suppliers' standard variable tariffs. These are the most widely used tariffs and often the most expensive.
Both BEIS and energy regulator Ofgem said despite the cap customers are likely to cut their bills by switching to cheaper deals available.
""Consumers can save more money this winter by shopping around for a better deal,"" Dermot Nolan, Ofgem chief executive said in the government's statement.
Around 4.4 million electricity and 3.6 million gas customers switched supplier in the first nine months of 2019, with typical households saving an average of 290 pounds a year on their energy bills, BEIS said.
Customers not switching and relying on the price cap saved around 75 to 100 pounds a year, it said.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker unveiled the electric Mustang crossover on Nov. 17, and began taking reservations with a refundable deposit of $500.
There are four other versions of the Mach-E in addition to the First Edition. 
Ford did not provide details on how many reservations it took for the First Edition, which sells for about $60,000, but has said global production in the first 12 months for all versions of the Mach-E is limited to 50,000 vehicles. 
The Mach-E has become a high-profile test for a restructuring at Ford that has been marred by profit warnings, costly quality problems and the troubled launch this year of another important vehicle, the Ford Explorer sport utility.
The Mach-E was unveiled in Los Angeles in November. It will be built in Mexico, the first of more than a dozen all-electric vehicles Ford plans to launch by 2022 with an investment of $11.5 billion. The Mach-E's design was inspired by the classic 1960s Mustang sports car and is meant to challenge electric carmaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
More than 80% of U.S. customers are reserving Mach-E with an extended range battery, while about 55% opted for an all-wheel drive, Ford said. (https://ford.to/2u0BMOJ)

The world's largest defense contractor delivered a total of 134 of the stealthy jets this year and aims to deliver 141 F-35s in 2020.
The most common variation of the jet, the F-35A, now costs $77.9 million, beating its goal of lowering the price to below $80 million a year earlier than expected.
The F-35 program, which makes up about 25% of Lockheed's annual revenue, has long aimed at expanding the fleet to more than 3,000 jets and bringing the unit price of the F-35A below $80 million through efficiencies gained by bulk orders.
Earlier this year, Pentagon announced pricing details for its agreement with Lockheed that lowers the cost of the F-35 jets it plans to purchase through 2022 by 12.7%, which may encourage other nations to buy the warplane.
In 2019, international deliveries jumped 43% to 30 jets for international partner nations.
More U.S. allies have been eyeing a purchase of the stealthy jet including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

The F-35 comes in three configurations: the A-model for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. allies, a F-35 B-model which can handle short takeoffs and vertical landings and carrier-variant F-35C jets for the U.S. Navy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major stock indexes slipped from record highs on Monday as investors booked profits from gains made this month after the United States and China reached a trade deal.
The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq posted their biggest one-day percentage declines in about four weeks.
Monday brought minor updates on the U.S.-China trade agreement. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the pact was likely to be signed in the next week but that confirmation would come from President Donald Trump or U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
A South China Morning Post report said Chinese Vice Premier Liu He would travel to Washington later this week to sign the deal.
The news provided little impetus for U.S. stocks to extend their steep climb, analysts said. Going into Monday, the benchmark S&P 500 had notched record high closes in nine of the past 11 sessions.
""Many traders and portfolio managers have reached their targets and don't want to jeopardize their performance,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. ""So it's not unusual to see some profit-taking as we get to the close of the year.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 183.12 points, or 0.64%, to 28,462.14, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 18.73 points, or 0.58%, to 3,221.29 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 60.62 points, or 0.67%, to 8,945.99.
Communications services stocks (SPLRCL) fell 1%, the biggest percentage decline among the S&P 500's sectors. Technology stocks (SPLRCT) dropped 0.6% and weighed most heavily on the benchmark index. Technology, up 47.5% year-to-date, and communication services, up 30.6%, have led in percentage gains on the S&P 500 this year.
It is ""not uncommon for the leading sectors to pull back first when people start to sell because if it is an outperformer, then it warrants a lot more downside risk,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
On Tuesday, stocks will trade on Wall Street for a full session prior to Wednesday's New Year's Day break. In a bright spot among U.S. stocks, Nio Inc (N:NIO) shares surged 53.7% after the Chinese electric vehicle maker and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rival beat quarterly revenue estimates on higher demand.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.52-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 29 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.12 billion shares, below the 6.89 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days."

A group of lenders led by HPS Investment Partners and Baupost Group LLC are in talks to provide a loan of around $2 billion to keep the company's operations running during bankruptcy, according to the report.
McDermott, whose shares were down 45.7% at $0.76, declined to comment.
The bankruptcy financing will help the company provide letters of credit, which are crucial for the company to continue financing projects, the Journal reported.
Most of McDermott's letters of credit expire within a year and need to be renewed for the company to continue its work on projects, the newspaper said.
McDermott will continue to pursue a sale process for its Lummus Technology unit in bankruptcy, as part of its restructuring plan, according to the report.
Earlier in September, the company received takeover interests for all or part of the business that could value the unit at over $2.5 billion."
1001,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 04:04PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Markets Show Investor Optimism Riding High Into 2020,"(Bloomberg) -- After a year framed by local unrest and the U.S.-China trade war, investors in Hong Kong’s financial markets are more sanguine going into 2020.
The city’s stocks and currency have rallied strongly in December, with the Hang Seng Index among the world’s top national benchmarks. Its 7.5% jump this month has kept it from a second-straight annual decline, which it hasn’t done in 17 years. Meanwhile, the city’s elevated borrowing costs have put the local dollar on pace for its best month since 2003 even as some analysts doubt the strength will stick.
Worries hanging over the city as its economy plunged into recession have ebbed, with protests easing a bit following a landslide for pro-democracy candidates in November elections and the U.S. and China agreeing to an initial trade agreement. They offset earlier worries about trade, which short-circuited robust early 2019 stock gains, and China’s still-slowing economy.
“It’s been a worse-than-expected year for Hong Kong’s financial markets due to the political events,” said Sam Chi Yung, a Hong Kong-based strategist with Springwaters Financial Group Co. “Since the city’s tension has eased recently and more trade deals are expected to be signed next year, the market is set for a good start in 2020,” added Yung, who’s expecting a “good rebound” for the Hang Sang in the first half.
The benchmark may have gotten a jump on that. December’s gain, among the biggest of 2019 for the Hang Seng, has it at five-month highs. Still, its 9.6% advance this year has the Hang Seng trailing most major stock indexes around the world.
Here’s What Analysts Say About Hong Kong Stocks for 2020
After the Hang Seng’s strong start to 2019, occurring as Chinese equities surged, markets were hit by inflamed trade tensions. Keeping any stock rebound in check has been China’s economy, which grew at the slowest pace since at least the early 1990s in the third quarter. Mainland firms account for more than half the market value of Hang Seng components. Adding to the spring pullback in Hong Kong stocks were persistent protests which started in June.
While there’s anticipation the year-end rally for equities can persist, some market watchers believe the Hong Kong dollar’s 0.5% gain for December will prove short-lived. That as the currency is about to end a year in the strong half of its trading band for the first time since 2016.
Longest Hong Kong Dollar Rally in Eight Years Is Burning Shorts
Local interbank lending rates have been elevated since November, triggered by what many consider a transitory surge in demand for cash, such as banks hoarding funds for regulatory checks at the end of the year. The higher rates helped outstrip the income a trader can expect from U.S. dollars, undermining the so-called carry trade. Investors selling the city’s dollars and buying greenbacks has been a profitable move for years.
“The Hong Kong dollar should weaken past the year-end, as local interest rates should soften,” said Stephen Chiu, an Asia foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “A more-sustained retreat in Hong Kong rates and the city’s currency could come after” the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, he added. Then, too, typically sees a seasonal increase for cash."
1002,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 02:51PM ET</span>",U.S. securities regulator proposes easing auditor independence rules,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Monday proposed updating its auditor independence rules to give accounting firms more leeway when determining potential conflicts of interest that could impair their judgment when scrutinizing companies' books.
The SEC said the proposal would update the rules, which were last reviewed in 2003, to more closely focus the analysis of an auditor's independence on material problems as opposed to ""non-substantive"" or technical issues that pose no risk to investors.
But the additional leeway could raise concerns from Democrats, who worry the SEC under Chairman Jay Clayton too frequently sides with corporate interests over investors. Clayton has said he prioritizes protecting average investors while encouraging companies to utilize public markets.
Securities rules aim to ensure audit firms are impartial when assessing issuers' books, but consolidation in the global audit industry has resulted in the largest four accountancy firms often having multiple ties with big companies.
The SEC said the proposed changes reflect years of experience assessing auditor independence, with commission staff spending considerable time analyzing loose affiliations which they consistently found pose no impartiality threat.
This is especially the case where a conglomerate may have multiple subsidiaries scattered across the globe whose management have no links to one another.
""The proposed amendments also would increase the number of qualified audit firms an issuer could choose from and permit audit committees and Commission staff to better focus on relationships that could impair an auditor’s objectivity and impartiality,"" said Clayton in a statement.
The SEC said the proposal, which is subject to a 60-day comment period, aims to update its rules to address corporate complexity with a handful of targeted changes.
Specifically, the agency has proposed amending the definition of an affiliate to focus on substantive relationships between entities, and to take a more relaxed view on ties between the underlying entities of a portfolio company.
Another key change would see the SEC exempt student loans held by audit firm staff from the list of potential conflicts, provided the loans were obtained before that person joined the firm."

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African telecoms firm MTN (J:MTNJ) on Monday said it was reviewing allegations raised in a U.S. complaint which accuses several firms of paying protection money to militant Islamist groups in Afghanistan.
The complaint was filed in the United States District Court in the District of Columbia on Friday.
It alleges the firms violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act by paying protection money to al Qaeda and the Taliban, thereby providing material support to known terrorist organizations.
It seeks damages on behalf of U.S. military members and civilians killed or wounded in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2017.
""MTN is reviewing the details of the report and is consulting its advisers but remains of the view that it conducts its business in a responsible and compliant manner in all its territories,"" the company said in a statement.
UK security services company G4S (L:GFS), which was also named in the lawsuit, declined to comment.
The complaint follows investigations by a group of large Washington-based law firms and alleges firms provided ""material support"" to known terrorists leading to numerous U.S. injuries and deaths, according to a statement by the law firms involved.
MTN spokeswoman Nompilo Morafo said the company could not yet respond directly to the specific allegations in the report as it was still going through the details. 
""We cannot comment further than what we've said in the statement. We want a chance to review the allegations. We only received the suit on Friday and we're still going through it. I also can't confirm how long it's going to take,"" Morafo said.
MTN is Africa's largest mobile operator and eighth biggest in the world with 243.7 million subscribers. It has previously faced scrutiny over its Iranian operations. 
In February a former South African ambassador to Iran was arrested on charges that he took a bribe to help MTN win a $31.6 billion license to operate there.

The company has also faced costly disputes over unregistered SIM cards, tax and dividend repatriation in Nigeria.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 08:24AM ET</span>",U.S. sanctions block hurry-up work on Russian gas pipeline: officials,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Any companies that rush to finish building a Russian natural gas export pipeline to Germany that came under U.S. sanctions this month risk being penalized, senior U.S. officials said on Sunday. 
President Donald Trump signed a bill late this month imposing sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project led by Gazprom (MM:GAZP), Russia's state-controlled gas company. The project aims to send gas under the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine and doubling the capacity of the existing line. 
The threat of sanctions blocking access to the U.S. financial system forced Allseas, a Swiss-Dutch company that lays deep-sea pipe, to suspend work on the project. All but a 100-mile (160-km) stretch remains to be completed. 
That short distance and a 30-day ""wind-down"" period of work stipulated in sanctions, have led to speculation that the pipeline would be finished soon.
But the senior U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, rejected the notion that the ""good faith"" wind-down period granted companies time to rush to finish Nord Stream 2.
""Good faith wouldn't be hurrying up to lay pipe,"" one official said. 
""Sanctions will be imposed unless they demonstrate good-faith efforts,"" showing they are pulling out, another official said, adding that the point of the sanctions, spearheaded by Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from energy-producing Texas, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, is to stop the project.
""Allseas' construction fleet has left the Baltic Sea and has been demobilized to prepare for other work,"" Allseas said in a statement on Monday.
Since the Obama administration, Washington has opposed the project on the grounds it would strengthen Russian President Vladimir Putin's economic and political grip over Europe. Russia has cut deliveries of the fuel to Ukraine and other parts of Europe in recent winters during pricing disputes.
The Trump administration has touted U.S. liquefied natural gas as ""freedom gas"" that gives Europe an alternative to Russian supply. U.S. exports of natural gas spiked more than 60% in 2019, but there are also concerns that a glut could weaken demand. 
There is room for the Trump administration to determine what ""good faith"" means, but the wind-down period is meant to allow time for companies to straighten up financial arrangements and safely remove equipment, one official said.
Despite U.S. sanctions, Russia says the pipeline will be finished. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the pipeline was expected to be launched before the end of 2020, pushing back original estimates of a late 2019 completion.
Russia may use a vessel currently docked at a far-eastern port to finish it, Novak said.

Nord Stream 2 said that ""the companies supporting the projects continue working on the soonest commissioning of the pipeline"".

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks clung to recent gains on Monday following healthy advances in Asia on hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal, a more optimistic growth outlook and a softer dollar, while the euro climbed to a 4-1/2 month high.
Yet European stock markets failed to follow the lead and took a breather following last week's record highs.
The pan-regional Euro Stoxx 600 (STOXX) was down 0.3% while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) slipped 0.5%. Banks (SX7P), which had been lagging the 2019 rally, were the only sector to mark small gains in thin year-end trading.
""Investors appear to be growing a tad apprehensive about chasing the record setting U.S. equity market risk-reward premise into year-end,"" Stephen Innes at AxiTrader wrote in a note to clients. ""Much focus continues to fall on the abundance of liquidity offered up by the Fed as a critical driver behind the late-season equity market window dressing.""
Many Asian bourses had marked healthy gains with Chinese blue chips (CSI300) roaring 1.5% higher, bolstered by a report that 2019 retail sales are forecast to rise 8% and expectations that a new benchmark for floating-rate loans could lower borrowing costs and boost flagging economic growth.
Yet Japan's Nikkei stock index (N225) finished its last trading day of the year down 0.76%. The index gained 18.2% in 2019 after dropping 12.8% last year.
Easing trade war worries have offered a lift to global equities this month, putting MSCI's global equity index (MIWD00000PUS) on track for a 3.8% rise in December - its fourth straight month of gains.
U.S. futures (ESc1) (NQc1) also pointed to a higher open after the S&P 500 (SPX) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at records on Friday.
In currency markets, the dollar index - measuring the currency against a basket of rivals - weakened 0.1% to 96.793 (DXY) in its third straight session in the red. Thin end-of-year volumes exacerbated the broad weakness in the greenback which on Friday suffered its biggest one-day fall since June.
""The U.S. dollar is the worst performing G10 currency overnight,"" said MUFG's Fritz Louw. ""The main drivers of the weaker dollar have likely been risk appetite holding up in the wake of comments from the U.S. pertaining to a Phase One trade deal recently as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve's continued repo operations.""
The weak greenback helped other currencies shine. The euro climbed as high as $1.1211 (EUR=), its strongest level since mid-August. Sterling also benefited, rising 0.2% to $1.3122 against the dollar. Yet the pound was flat against the euro at 85.38 pence amid concerns that Britain could be headed for a disruptive ""hard Brexit"" at the end of 2020.
China's yuan held below the key level of 7 per dollar, rising in offshore markets to 6.9752 , its highest since Dec. 13.
In fixed income markets, rising risk appetite saw euro zone bond yields rise across the board, with most 10-year bond yields two basis points higher on the day. Germany's Bund yield stood at -0.23% (DE10YT=RR), heading back toward recent six-month highs.

The softer dollar also lifted commodity markets with gold hitting a two month peak.
Oil prices held near three-month highs with traders also keeping a close watch on the Middle East following U.S. air strikes in Iraq and Syria against Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia group. U.S. officials said on Sunday that the attacks were successful, but warned ""additional actions"" may be taken to defend U.S. interests.
Global benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) traded at $68.33 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (CLc1) stood at $61.74.
Oil prices were also supported by a bigger-than-expected decline in crude inventories in the United States, the world's biggest fuel consumer. Stockpiles fell by 5.5 million barrels in the week to Dec. 20, far exceeding a 1.7-million-barrel drop forecast in a Reuters poll, government data showed on Friday."

1015,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 05:39AM ET</span>",More than 150 flights canceled in Germany as Lufthansa's Germanwings hit by strikes,"COLOGNE (Reuters) - Around 180 flights in Germany were canceled on Monday due to cabin crew strikes at Lufthansa's budget airline Germanwings, in a bid to put pressure on management in wage talks. 
The Ufo labor union on Friday announced strikes from Monday to Wednesday this week at Germanwings, which operates on behalf of Lufthansa's Eurowings brand, saying little progress has been achieved in talks with Lufthansa management.
Around 15% of flights at Eurowings needed to be canceled, a Lufthansa spokeswoman said on Monday.
""First 35 flights were canceled, then 54, now 170, meaning that Germanwings will only manage 7% of its original flight operations today,"" a spokesman for Ufo said, speaking at the Cologne-Bonn airport.
""That should be a sign for Lufthansa group. Your employees are really angry. You finally have to change something,"" he added.
The majority of the canceled flights were domestic, according to the Eurowings website. Stranded passengers were offered train tickets to their destinations or given a seat on flights operated by other Lufthansa airlines.
Some passengers said that while they understood cabin crew's grievances, the timing, in the middle of the holiday season, was problematic.
""I am from France and it is worse there. I am in favor of workers expressing themselves, but I am not sure if the time is right,"" said Celine Guiakam, a passenger at Cologne-Bonn airport.
""There is no good time for strikes. Every strike and every delay is one too many and in so far we regret that it has to happen at all,"" a spokesman for Eurowings said.
The deadlocked collective bargaining dispute for the 22,000 cabin employees concerns pay and working conditions among other issues 

Ufo held a strike for two days in November, resulting in the cancellation of one in five flights, affecting around 180,000 passengers and costing the airline 10-20 million euros ($22.39 million).

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 05:37AM ET</span>","Singtel, Grab join forces for Singapore digital bank license","By Aradhana Aravindan and Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (Singtel) (SI:STEL) is teaming up with Southeast Asian ride hailing firm Grab to bid for an online banking license in Singapore, the first such partnership that could spur a shake-up of the city state's financial sector.
The companies said in a joint statement that they will form a partnership, with Grab owning 60% and Singtel holding the remainder to apply for a digital banking license to serve retail and small and medium enterprises.
The move comes as Singapore's biggest liberalization of its banking sector in two decades seeks to enable digital banks that can operate at lower costs and therefore offer different services than traditional lenders such as DBS Group Holdings Ltd (SI:DBSM).
But stiff criteria for digital licenses, including requiring S$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in paid-up capital for retail banks and local control, is making it necessary for potential bidders to team up.
Singtel, the region's largest telecommunications firm, and Grab are among the best-known consumer names in Southeast Asia and both have been expanding outside their traditional businesses.
Singtel has been pushing into areas such as mobile payments and online gaming, while Grab has grown beyond its ride-hailing roots into food delivery and financial services.
""The natural next step is to build a truly customer-centric digital bank that will deliver a variety of banking and financial services that are accessible, transparent and affordable,"" Reuben Lai, senior managing director at Grab Financial Group, said in a statement.
Sources have told Reuters they expect bidders to team up to combine banking know-how and consumer facing technology expertise and invest jointly.
Singapore's central bank is set to issue up to two ""digital full bank"" licenses and three wholesale bank licenses. Digital full banks can accept deposits from and offer services to both retail and non-retail customers but must be led by a Singapore-based company.
Wholesale banks will mostly serve small and mid-sized enterprises. 
The digital banking space is a natural extension of the mobile financial services that Singtel already offers, said Arthur Lang, CEO of Singtel's International Group. 
With stakes in telecoms companies worldwide, Singtel says it reaches more than 700 million mobile customers in 21 countries, while Grab says its app has been downloaded onto over 166 million mobile devices.

Singapore is set to announce the winners in mid-2020 and the digital banks are expected to start operations in a phased manner from mid-2021.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 05:37AM ET</span>",EU seeks reset in trade talks with U.S. - trade chief Hogan,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - The European Union's new trade commissioner, Irishman Phil Hogan, was quoted on Monday as saying he would seek a reset of EU/US trade relations on a number of contentious issues when he meets his U.S. counterpart for the first time next month.
The Trump administration imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum in mid-2018. It has done the same to $7.5 billion worth of EU products over a dispute about subsidies for European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR), and is threatening action against France over a digital services tax.
Hogan, who was promoted from the role of EU farm chief this month, spoke to U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer just before Christmas, he told the Irish Times newspaper.
""We agreed to meet in Washington in mid-January to discuss the long list of issues causing strain in the relationship between the EU and the US. There is no point in getting into the details of resolving trade irritants unless we agree a line on a common trade agenda,"" he was quoted as saying.
""I will be seeking a reset of the EU/US trade relationship on issues like tariffs on steel and aluminum and the threat of US tariffs in response to a digital tax in Europe.""
The two sides are in theory trying to forge a deal to remove overall import duties, but are stuck over farm products, which Washington says must be included and Brussels says cannot feature.
They are also at odds over Washington's paralysis of the World Trade Organization's judicial arm, a vital part of the global trading system.

The European Commission has said the bloc will act as one over the planned U.S. tariffs on French goods, and that a threat this month to increase EU-wide tariffs in relation to the Airbus dispute would make a settlement more difficult to achieve.

1018,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 04:56AM ET</span>",European stocks fall on profit-taking amid holiday lull,"By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Lisa Pauline Mattackal
(Reuters) - European shares retreated on Monday, as investors cashed in gains from a record run in stocks that has put the benchmark index on course for its best year since the global financial crisis.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) began a holiday-shortened week with a 0.4% fall, with France's EssilorLuxottica among the biggest drags on the index.
The spectacles company (PA:ESLX) shed 2.2%, eyeing its worst day in four weeks, after saying it had discovered fraudulent activity at a plant in Thailand that was expected to cost the company 190 million euros ($213 million).
The lull was also reflected in major country indexes, with Frankfurt shares (GDAXI) declining more than half a percent in the absence of any major updates on a U.S.-China trade truce. Spanish stocks (IBEX) dropped 0.5%, while London-listed shares (FTSE) dipped 0.3%.
""Volumes are about 50% below average and people are doing as little as possible: a little bit of profit taking and a little bit of window dressing as it's the year end,"" said Mark Taylor, a sales trader at Mirabaud.
After somewhat choppy trading earlier in the year, European equities have enjoyed a strong December as investors received clarity on two of the major risks to global economic growth: the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit.
Fairly upbeat economic data from around the world has also eased recession fears, with latest figures showing Spain's economy growing 0.4% in the third quarter, in line with a flash estimate.
But with just two days left until the end of the decade, few major updates are expected on the initial Sino-U.S. trade agreement, giving stock prices little motivation to move much from current levels.
Among individual stocks, Italian state-owned lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) gained 0.9% as it completed three disposals of impaired loans for around 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion), surpassing a goal set in its restructuring plan two years ahead of time.

Norway-based  Elkem  (OL:ELK), a supplier of silicone and silicon materials, rose 2% after agreeing to acquire Polysil, a Chinese maker of silicone elastomer and resins.

PT Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk (JK:BDMN), of which MUFG Bank Ltd owns 94.1%, closed at 3,950 rupiah on Monday on the Indonesia Stock Exchange's last trading day of 2019.
Under accounting rules, if Danamon's shares close below 50% of the average price MUFG paid for its stake, the Japanese bank is required to reassess the value of the holding and book a one-time charge.
MUFG does not disclose the price level where it would be required to book an extraordinary charge. It has built up its stake through a series of acquisitions since 2017. In April it more than doubled its holding to 94% from 40%, paying 9,590 rupiah a share, according to a filing.
But shares of Bank Danamon have tumbled since and this month hit their lowest in nearly three years, at 3,640 rupiah. The shares are down by nearly half this year, and were hit particularly hard in May after index provider MSCI removed the bank from its Global Standard index due to low liquidity.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has started delivering Model 3 electric cars built at its Shanghai factory in just under a year since it began work on the $2 billion plant, a record for global automakers in China, and said it would ramp up deliveries from next month.
The U.S. electric vehicle maker marked the start with an event on Monday where 15 Tesla employees received cars they had purchased, one of whom took the opportunity to propose marriage to his girlfriend after getting his new set of wheels. 
The China-made Model 3 sedans are priced at 355,800 yuan ($50,000) before subsidies. Imported Model 3 vehicles start at 439,000 yuan for the longer-range version, while the standard range plus model costs under $40,000 in the United States. 
The Shanghai plant, up and running in just 357 days, is part of Tesla's plans to bolster its presence in the world's biggest car market and minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.
The automaker, which previously imported all the cars it sold in China, had said it wanted to start deliveries from the Shanghai plant before the Lunar New Year beginning on Jan. 25. 
""From now onwards China-made Model 3 vehicles will start running on China's large streets and small lanes,"" Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said at the delivery ceremony which was attended by employees and Shanghai government officials. 
China General Manager for the Silicon Valley carmaker Wang Hao said Tesla plans to ramp up Model 3 deliveries in January. 
The Chinese government has been supportive of the factory, the first wholly foreign-owned car plant and a reflection of Beijing's broader shift to open up its auto market.
CHINA PUSH
Tesla has taken a different approach to the Chinese market, the world's biggest for electric vehicles with 1.3 million new-energy vehicles sold last year, as is evident from its marketing blitz in the country that is quite unlike anywhere else.
The company and its flamboyant billionaire CEO Elon Musk openly disdain marketing, but in China Tesla has offered racing events and showroom parties. 
It is also building service centers and charging stations across China to assure customers of standardized after-sales service, Tesla's senior executives said, confirming a Reuters report on the plans published last month.
The car maker will double the number of service centers and fast charging stations in China next year, and plans to more than double its after-sales workforce to 1,500 from about 600 currently, the executives added.

Wang also told reporters the plant had achieved a production target of 1,000 units a week, or around 280 cars a day, and that sales for the China-made sedan had so far been ""very good"".

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 02:07AM ET</span>","The Decade of Debt: big deals, bigger risk","By Joshua Franklin and Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Whatever nickname ultimately gets attached to the now-ending Twenty-tens, on Wall Street and across Corporate America it arguably should be tagged as the ""Decade of Debt.""
With interest rates locked in at rock-bottom levels courtesy of the Federal Reserve's easy-money policy after the financial crisis, companies found it cheaper than ever to tap the corporate bond market to load up on cash.
Bond issuance by American companies topped $1 trillion in each year of the decade that began on Jan. 1, 2010, and ends on Tuesday at midnight, an unmatched run, according to SIFMA, the securities industry trade group. 
In all, corporate bond debt outstanding rocketed more than 50% and will soon top $10 trillion, versus about $6 trillion at the end of the previous decade. The largest U.S. companies - those in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) - account for roughly 70% of that, nearly $7 trillion.
Graphic: Long-term debt for S&P 500 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/10181/10092/Long%20term%20debt%20graphic.png
What did they do with all that money?
It's a truism in corporate finance that cash needs to be either ""earning or returning"" - that is, being put to use growing the business or getting sent back to shareholders.
As it happens, American companies did a lot more returning than earning with their cash during the 'Tens.
In the first year of the decade, companies spent roughly $60 billion more on dividends and buying back their own shares than on new facilities, equipment and technology. By last year that gap had mushroomed to more than $600 billion, and the gap in 2019 could be just as large, especially given the constraint on capital spending from the trade war.
The buy-back boom is credited with helping to fuel a decade-long bull market in U.S. equities. 
Graphic: S&P 500 shareholder payouts https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/10183/10094/payout%20graphic.png
Meanwhile, capital expenditure growth has been choppy at best over 10 years. This is despite a massive fiscal stimulus package by the Trump administration, marked by the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, that it had predicted would boost business spending.
Graphic: Capital expenditure of S&P 500 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/10184/10095/Capital%20expenditure%20graphic.png
One byproduct of stock buy-backs is they make companies look more profitable by Wall Street's favorite performance metric - earnings per share - than they would otherwise appear to be.
With companies purchasing more and more of their own stock, S&P 500 EPS has roughly doubled in 10 years. Meanwhile net profit has risen by half that, and far more erratically.

The corporate bond market has not only gotten bigger, it has gotten riskier.
With investors clamoring for yield in a low-rate world, debt rated only a notch or two above high-yield - or junk - bond levels now accounts for more than half of the investment-grade market, versus around a third at the dawn of the decade.

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>",U.S. LNG exports soar in 2019 but supply glut may await in 2020,"By Scott DiSavino
(Reuters) - U.S. exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG) head into 2020 after a record year that saw exports soar by more than 60%, but growing concerns about weakened demand and heavy competition could act as headwinds in the coming year.
Four new liquefaction trains - the common term for a shipping facility - entered service this year in the United States. The U.S. is on track to become the biggest global LNG exporter by 2024.
LNG is seen as an alternative for Asian countries that have relied on coal-fired power plants. LNG exports have surged in recent years out of Qatar, Australia, and the United States, the three biggest exporters of the super-cooled fuel.
The fickle nature of the market was apparent early this year, when a warm winter in Asia cut heating demand and prompted Asian importers to divert cargoes to Europe.
""It’s likely that LNG prices will stay somewhat depressed in 2020, unless we get a cold winter across the pond and in the Far East,"" said James Mick, managing director and energy portfolio manager at energy investment manager Tortoise.
Prices in Europe and Asia are down by around 40% so far in 2019 to their lowest in years. Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Energy Aspects say some U.S. LNG export terminals could shut temporarily in 2020 due to a lack of demand. Lower prices and weak demand could endanger the myriad of LNG projects still in development.

Over the past couple of months, Singaporean gas importer Pavilion Energy canceled the loading of a U.S. LNG cargo and some Chinese companies were offering to resell cargoes as they grapple with high inventories and weak demand due to a slowing economy and a milder than usual winter.
That is bad news for U.S. gas producers counting on LNG exports - the fastest growing source of gas consumption - to keep hoovering up growing U.S. production.

Despite low prices, U.S. LNG developers in 2019 decided to build a record amount of capacity, and 10 different developers could decide to go ahead with projects in this coming year. However, the headwinds are making it difficult for some developers to sign enough long-term customer agreements needed to finance export projects.
Several LNG developers put off making final investment decisions (FIDs) for new facilities until 2020 as a result.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 01:10AM ET</span>",The decade that saw volatility trading come of age,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - What do you do when daily stock market gyrations all but dry up? Apparently, trade volatility like never before.
Among the myriad Wall Street legacies of the soon-ending 2010s has been the emergence of market volatility - or the magnitude of security price swings over short time spans - as an asset class unto itself. It is all the more notable against the backdrop of the decade's fairly persistent market calm.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) - nicknamed as 'Wall Street's fear index,' - is on track to end the decade at a level about a third lower than its lifetime average, according to Refinitiv data. With the S&P 500 Index nearly tripling since the end of 2009, the average level of the VIX this decade is the lowest of the three since it launched in the early 90s, even with a number of periodic spikes higher.
Nonetheless, trading volatility, or ""vol"" in Wall Street parlance, came of age in a big way in the '10s.
While vol has been around for as long as markets have existed, as an asset class it had remained out of reach of the average investor. That changed over the last two decades.
The launch of futures and options on the VIX in the mid-2000s led the way for the rollout of sophisticated exchange traded products (ETPs) near the end of that decade and provided everyday investors the first chance to trade vol on its own.
A small legion of volatility-linked ETPs followed over the next 10 years.
Some allowed investors to bet on stock gyrations rising, while others let traders bet on the opposite outcome.
With the launch of these ETPs, trading in volatility was no longer limited to the futures and options market, where it all began. Investors could finally place bets on volatility as easily as trading stocks.
Investors plowed billions of dollars into both long and short volatility ETPs, with assets of select leveraged and inverse volatility ETPs hitting about $4 billion by the end of 2017. Assets in top volatility-linked ETPs now stand at about $3 billion.
Graphic: VIX futures & ETPs https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/129/129/Pasted%20Image.jpg
While most of these products started out being used by institutional players as hedges, an extended period of stock market calm in 2016-2017 boosted the returns for some short volatility ETPs, including the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN , attracting ever more speculative players.
Yield-starved investors had stumbled upon what looked like the proverbial free lunch.
In an environment where the VIX plunged to new lows, buying short volatility ETPs reaped gold.
Volatility selling became such a rage that analysts warned that the trade was creating a feedback loop where the more investors sold volatility the lower it slipped.
That is until a sudden drop in the U.S. stock market in February 2018 wiped out most of the value of these ETPs and led to the collapse of some products, including XIV.
As the decade ends, the volatility ETP landscape looks much more stable than it did in 2016-2017, even as interest in trading volatility looks here to stay.

Investing.com – Equity markets continued to rise rose Monday morning in Asia, starting a short New Year’s Day week strong after finishing the shortened Christmas week at multi-month highs.  
On Friday, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index closed at its highest levels in five months while U.S. markets hit record highs. 
Monday morning, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.70% by 10:46 PM ET (03:47GMT). 
Mainland China markets were also trading higher. China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.94%, the Shenzhen Component was up 0.86%.  
In a push for growth and in the midst of the trade war between the U.S. and China, for which the signing of a phase one deal is expected in early January, China’s central bank announced during the weekend its loan prime rate (LPR) will become a new benchmark for current floating-rate loans.  
“The purpose of the step is to make interest rates more market-driven and help lower financing costs,” Wen Bin, an economist at Minsheng Bank in Beijing told Reuters. 
According to the People´s Bank of China, starting January 1 it will be prohibited for new floating-rate loan contracts to base their lending rates on the current benchmark, which has been unchanged since the third quarter of 2015 at 4.35% The LPR for one-year loans stands at 4.15%. 
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 traded 0.61% lower after losing ground last Friday due to a number of stocks that traded without the value of the next dividend payment (ex-dividend).

Almost all 33 industry groups on the benchmark measure fell, with electronics makers contributing most to the market’s early declines.
The yen maintained its advance against the dollar after rising 0.2% on Friday. The Topix is still set to cap an annual gain of more than 15% this year, its best such performance since 2017. The local market had staged a rebound thanks to a phase-one trade agreement between the U.S. and China that eased concerns for export-reliant Japan.
“The market will start off with a bit of selling given the slightly stronger yen,” said Juichi Wako, a strategist at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo. “There’s no need to take any big risks” ahead of China’s PMI figures and U.S. ISM manufacturing data, which will released when Japan is on holiday, he added.

1029,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 29, 2019 10:47PM ET</span>",Tesla Just Delivered Its First China-Built Cars in Shanghai,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. delivered its first China-built cars on Monday, a milestone for Elon Musk’s company as it accelerates a push in the world’s largest electric-vehicle market.
The company handed over the Model 3 sedans assembled at Tesla’s new multi-billion-dollar Shanghai plant -- its first outside the U.S. -- to company employees in a ceremony at the facility on Monday. A total of 15 vehicles were to be handed over.
Chief Executive Officer Musk is counting on the China plant to help build on recent momentum for the company in the world’s largest market both for EVs and autos in general. The Model 3 will compete with electric cars from local contenders such as NIO Inc. and Xpeng Motors, as well as global manufacturers including BMW AG and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn).
While China-built cars aren’t yet being delivered to customers outside the company, Monday’s milestone caps several months of wins for Musk. The latest came Friday, when the locally built car was included on a list of vehicles qualifying for an exemption from a 10% purchase tax in China.
The stock has surged since the carmaker reported a surprise profit on Oct. 23, and is now more than double its year low of $178.93 in June. The shares closed little changed at $430.38 on Friday.
Muddy Plot
The Shanghai Gigafactory broke ground at the start of this year. Originally just a muddy plot about a 90-minute drive away from Shanghai’s city center, it is now a crucial test of Musk’s bid to keep his carmaker profitable as he bets big on Chinese appetite for electric cars.
With Tesla’s volatile stock price and strained finances, investors will be watching closely how the ramp-up unfolds. The multibillion-dollar investment will be a deciding factor to determine whether Tesla will be able to take on local competitors and fend off challenges by the likes of Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi.
Although Musk has said he’s never seen a factory built so quickly, the first delivery came only a day before the end of 2019. Back in April, the CEO predicted Tesla would make at least 1,000 cars a week in Shanghai by the end of the year — a volume the company’s original factory in California spent months trying to hit. He’s also said a weekly rate of 3,000 is a target at some point.
Tesla said in October the locally built Model 3 will be priced from about $50,000. On top of the tax exemption announced Friday, the China-built model this month qualified for a government subsidy of as much as about 25,000 yuan ($3,600) per vehicle.
The company may lower the price of the locally assembled sedans by 20% or more next year as it starts using more local components and reduces costs, people familiar with the matter have said.
The launch will also provide clues about Tesla’s ability to truly go global. The company is planning to follow up with a production facility in Germany to tap rising electric-car demand in Europe.

LISBON (Reuters) - A three-day strike by workers at Lisbon airport led to the cancellation of several flights this weekend, with more likely before the action ends on Sunday, the workers' union and Portuguese airport authority said.
EasyJet (L:EZJ), Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Transavia France, and Wizz Air UK flights from and to Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Germany were canceled on Saturday and Sunday. 
SINTAC union spokesman Fernando Simoes said 19 flights had been canceled due to the strike, with seven redirected to Faro airport in the south of Portugal.
Portugal's airport authority's website showed more than 25 flights to and from the airport had been canceled.
A Lisbon airport spokesman declined to confirm the number of cancellations, but said a statement would likely be given at the end of the day. 
Talks between SINTAC and Vinci Group-owned Portway, which employs workers at Lisbon, Porto, Faro and Funchal airports, broke down in December when the company said it would not unfreeze salaries.
It had committed to do so by November 2019 when the freeze was implemented in 2016.
Portway said in a statement on Sunday that it was ready to return to the negotiating table, with discussions already scheduled for January.
However, SINTAC spokesman Fernando Simoes told Reuters that the union plans to carry on with another strike by overtime and weekend workers from Jan. 1 to the end of March.
SINTAC said the company's decision not to unfreeze salaries was intended to punish the union's rejection of a revised work contract put forward by Portway in August.
""For three years workers have seen their career progression and salaries frozen for the sake of the company's financial health,"" they said on Friday. 

Portway denied the allegations, Lusa reported on Friday, stating that they ""scrupulously comply with regulations, including in relation to labor law"".

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru´s government on Friday night announced measures to strengthen penalties for companies found responsible for workplace accidents, days after two McDonald´s franchisee workers died in one of its restaurants.
Minister of Labor Sylvia Caceres said from now on there would be an automatic closure of 10 to 20 days of businesses where accidents happened to allow for a full investigation, which could extend to 30 days if the company´s responsibility for the accident was determined.
""Closure (for the 30-day maximum) will be considered when it has been determined that the employer has breached its obligations and thereby affected the health and life of its workers,"" Caceres told a news conference on Friday night.
She made no mention of the deaths of Alexandra Porras, 18, and Carlos Campo, 19, a young couple who died by electrocution while cleaning the kitchen of a McDonald´s Corp (N:MCD) restaurant operated by its Latin American franchisee Arcos Dorados (N:ARCO).
The general manager of the McDonald's operating firm in Peru said in an interview with local TV that the drinks supply machine at the restaurant was suffering from an electrical fault that its managers had not reported to the company´s maintenance department.
This week the labor inspection agency found Arcos Dorados Peru guilty of six ""very serious"" safety and health violations that caused the death of pair and proposed the company be fined $254,000.
Caceres said that fines for fatal accidents ""have no relevance if they do not even affect the operation of the company economically.""
""We believe that this is a step forward to reinforce the dissuasive capacity that the labor inspectorate must exert for employers who deliberately and irresponsibly breach their obligations and affect the health of our workers,"" she said.
Arcos Dorados said last week that all 29 McDonald's restaurants in Peru would remain closed until they finished their own site inspections."

(Reuters) - TOMS Shoes LLC's creditors have agreed to take over the maker of casual footwear in exchange for restructuring its debt, according to a company letter sent to employees on Friday and people familiar with the matter. 
Credit ratings agencies had warned that TOMS, which is known for its charitable giving, would not have been able to repay a $300 million loan due next year without renegotiating it with its creditors. The Los Angeles-based company has struggled to keep up with competitors lowering their prices, as the novelty of its ""One for One"" model of donating a pair of shoes for each one sold wears off among consumers. 
The group of creditors, led by Jefferies Financial Group Inc (N:JEF), Nexus Capital Management LP and  Brookfield Asset Management  Inc (TO:BAMa), will take over ownership of TOMS from its founder Blake Mycoskie and private equity firm Bain Capital, according to the letter. In exchange, the creditors will provide debt relief to the company, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential arrangements.
Bain had acquired a 50% stake in TOMS five years ago, valuing the company at $625 million, including debt. Mycoskie owned the remainder. It is not yet clear whether Mycoskie will continue to have a role with the company given that he will no longer be an owner. 
The new owners have agreed to invest $35 million in TOMS to show their commitment and support its future growth, according to the letter.
""Combined with an enhanced capital structure, this funding will enable TOMS to further invest in our promising growth areas and continue our commitment to giving, which have been initiated and supported by Bain Capital and Blake over the past five years,"" TOMS CEO Jim Alling wrote in the letter to employees. 
TOMS was founded in 2006 by Mycoskie, a former contestant on U.S. reality TV show ""The Amazing Race,"" after he visited a village in Argentina where children lacked shoes. Since then it has gifted close to 100 million pairs of shoes to children, according to a statement the company issued last month. 
TOMS has expanded its gifting model beyond its casual footwear, known as alpargatas, to other retail categories. TOMS Roasting Co, for example, donates a week's worth of clean water to a person in need for every bag of coffee purchased, while TOMS Eyewear donates prescription glasses and medical treatment with each purchase of eyewear.
While the company continues to donate shoes, its charitable model has evolved. It now says it commits a third of its net profits toward a giving fund that finances a wide range of philanthropic and social causes. 

Under Bain, TOMS streamlined its supply chain and brought in Alling, a former chief operating officer of T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS), as CEO.

Emergency medical services took 11 people to the hospital, one of them suffering potentially serious injuries, Dr. John Gallagher, director of Sedgwick County EMS, told a news conference.
Company officials said two of victims went to the hospital in private cars and two were treated at the scene.
Injuries were limited because only a skeleton crew was on duty during the holidays, said Deputy Chief Daniel Wegner of the Sedgwick County Fire Department.
The explosion in a 3-inch liquid nitrogen gas line also damaged a storage tank, causing nitrogen gas to vent out of the building, Wegner said.
News video from the scene showed what appeared to be a steam cloud billowing out of the damaged building. The gas was not harmful, Wegner said.
A second valve also ruptured, said Kate Flavin, a spokeswoman for Sedgwick County, and emergency crews vented nitrogen gas from the affected tanks before doing another search of the plant.
No others were found injured and control of the facility was returned to Textron shortly after noon, but emergency crews remained on standby at the scene, she said.
Damage was contained to Plant 3, a site for composite manufacturing and experimental aircraft fabrication including that of the SkyCourier, said Stephanie Harder, a spokeswoman for Textron.
The SkyCourier, a utility turboprop under development, is due to enter service in 2020, Textron has previously said. Harder said it was too early to determine what damage the prototype aircraft under production may have suffered.
Textron Aviation, a unit of  Textron Inc  (N:TXT), makes Beechcraft and Cessna aircraft.
The Wichita-area economy has long been supported by aircraft manufacturing.

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 04:59PM ET</span>","S&P 500, Dow eke out records; Nasdaq win streak ends","By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - The Nasdaq snapped an 11-day streak of gains on Friday after some late-session weakness, but the S&P 500 and the Dow scratched out record closing highs with slight gains as a year-end rally chugged along.
With only two trading days left for the year, the benchmark S&P 500 has climbed more than 29% so far in 2019, its biggest annual percentage gain since 2013. Trading volume has been thin during the holiday-shortened week and could continue to be sparse through the New Year's holiday on Wednesday.
“For the most part, the market seems to be in a holding pattern until year-end,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
“There has been such strong gains for the year that I think that until the fresh money comes in after year-end for new contributions to IRAs and other retirement accounts to start the year, I just don’t think there is a lot of push to drive this too much higher,” Meckler said.
Data on Friday showed profits at China's industrial firms grew at the fastest pace in eight months in November, but broad weakness in the country's domestic demand remains a risk for company earnings next year.
Investor expectations that the United States and China will soon sign a Phase 1 trade deal has added momentum to the stock market heading into 2020.
""You’ve got expectations that the Phase 1 trade agreement is signed in early to mid-January,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson.
""In a situation where you have got the trade expectation that could help stimulate business spending next year, still low interest rates and the strong consumer. That’s a recipe for equity values to continue to move higher,"" Ragan said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 23.87 points, or 0.08%, to 28,645.26, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.11 points to 3,240.02 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 15.77 points, or 0.17%, to 9,006.62.
Among S&P 500 sectors, consumer staples (SPLRCS), real estate and utilities (SPLRCU) were the top performers. Energy (SPNY) and materials (SPLRCM) lagged among the sectors.
Aside from optimism over trade relations, the stock market has been lifted by interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and better-than-feared economic data and corporate profits.
About 5.2 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.52-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 59 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 96 new highs and 23 new lows."
1043,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 04:27PM ET</span>","Year in Stocks Ending Just Like It Began, in Straight-Up Bliss","(Bloomberg) -- For stock traders, the middle months of 2019 got crazy enough that one veteran called them weirder than the financial crisis. The beginning and end, on the other hand, have featured tranquility with few precedents in financial markets.
The S&P 500 started the year by rising in nine of the first 10 weeks. Now it’s closing it out with gains in 11 out of the past 12, a feat of concerted advances that occurred only once before since 1985. The Nasdaq Composite Index just missed climbing for a 12 straight day, the most in a decade, and, up 12.7%, is on pace for its best fourth quarter since 2004.
While a category of Wall Street wags starts panicking when gains come this easy, anyone who heeded warnings about euphoria after the Nasdaq surged 16.5% in the first quarter has missed a 16.7% jump since it ended. Gains don’t always beget losses in the stock market -- ask anyone who has watched the Faang stocks triple after he sold them in 2013.
Stocks ended Friday mixed as traders assessed a rally that’s added more than $5 trillion to equities this year, but the S&P 500 notched a fifth straight weekly advance and the Nasdaq Composite jumped above 9,000 for the first time. Blue-chip companies led the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record high. The dollar slid against most of its major peers. Treasuries rose. Oil rebounded from Friday’s lows as a government report showed U.S. crude inventories sank to a two-month low.
While it’s been a big December melt-up for the S&P 500, technical warning signs of a climax may be brewing. The index is edging ever closer to the upper band of its trading envelope, while its GTI Global Strength Indicator -- a measure of upward and downward movements of successive closing prices -- reveals the deepest overbought territory in all of 2019.
“There’s almost no identifiable news/events that would derail the rally over the next few days,” according to Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded “The Sevens Report” newsletter. Still, nearly “all of the December gains have come on almost no material news -- and that should temper the optimism a bit,” he wrote.
Earlier Friday, equities got a lift from reports of strong holiday-season revenue, with e-commerce sales jumping, which reassured traders that American consumers are feeling confident. A solid rebound for industrial profits in China also buoyed sentiment, with investors now looking to the initial trade deal with the U.S. to sustain gains in the new year.
These are some of the main moves in markets:

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>","Amazon's Ring cameras are vulnerable to hackers, lawsuit in U.S. claims","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and its Ring home security camera unit have been sued by an Alabama homeowner who said the cameras' defective design leaves purchasers vulnerable to cyberattacks.
In a proposed class action filed on Thursday, John Baker Orange said an unknown hacker recently accessed his Ring camera while his children, ages 7, 9 and 10, were playing basketball on the driveway, and through its speaker system encouraged them to move closer to the camera.
Orange, who said he paid $249 for his camera in July, said the cameras work only when connected to the internet, and are ""fatally flawed"" because they do not protect against cyberattacks, despite Ring's assurances of ""peace of mind"" and ""smart security here, there, everywhere.""
A spokeswoman for Ring said the Santa Monica, California-based company does not discuss legal matters.
The complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court seeks unspecified damages from Ring and Seattle-based Amazon, as well as improved security for new and existing Ring cameras.
It followed several reported incidents of hackers accessing homes through Ring cameras, including when a man repeatedly called an 8-year-old Mississippi girl a racial slur and claimed he was Santa Claus.
""A company that sells a device that is supposed to protect occupants of a home shouldn't become a platform for potentially endangering those occupants,"" John Yanchunis, a lawyer for Orange, said in an interview.
Ring's main product is a doorbell that contains a security camera and lets homeowners monitor and communicate with visitors through a phone app even if they are not at home.
Amazon has said it bought Ring in April 2018 for $839 million in cash.
Orange, who lives in Jefferson County, Alabama, said he changed his ""medium-strong"" password and began using two-factor authentication for his camera after learning about the incident involving his children.
""So many devices are tethered to the Internet, and consumers simply don't have a realization of how that can be so easily exploited,"" Yanchunis said.

The case is Orange v Ring LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 19-10899.

Danske Bank said it would defend itself against the lawsuit and that it had no information about the timing of the case.
Danske Bank is under investigation in several countries including the United States over 200 billion euros ($220 billion) of payments through its branch in Estonia between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank has said were suspicious.

The investors, including pension funds, insurance companies and asset managers from at least 12 countries, are represented by the International Securities Associations and Foundations Management Company for Damaged Danske Investors (ISAF-Danske).
The lawsuit claims Danske violated Danish Capital Market Laws by deliberately misleading and keeping investors in the dark for years, ISAF-Danske said in a statement. 
It said the bank did not disclose that ""its financial income statements and retained earnings included significant earnings from known illegal high-risk money laundering activities"". 
Danske Bank is already facing two lawsuits in the United States, including one by 232 pension funds and other investors claiming damages of nearly $800 million.

1054,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 10:16AM ET</span>",U.K. Eyes March Budget and Spending Boost in North of England,"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s freshly re-elected government is seeking to hold its first Budget in March, rewriting spending rules as it does so, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid was forced to scrap his planned Autumn Budget because of this month’s snap election. A rescheduled event wasn’t expected until after the U.K. left the European Union on Jan. 31, with some speculation it would happen as early as February.
Since winning the election, Johnson promised to heal divisions in a country that’s been split by Brexit, in particular by showing support for people in districts in the North of England who voted for his Conservative Party for the first time. Johnson’s top adviser Dominic Cummings has also criticized Treasury spending rules for favoring London and the South East.
Ahead of the Spring Budget, the Treasury will change the formula used in its so-called “Green Book”, which guides investment decisions on everything from infrastructure to business development.
The aim is to narrow the productivity gap between the north and south of England, which academics at Cambridge University last year described as “extreme” compared with other wealthy nations. They found the current cost-benefit analysis model favors investments in areas where the economy is already stronger.
A spokeswoman for the Treasury said: “We work across government to ensure investment is focused on where it is needed across the U.K. and delivers value for money for the taxpayer.”
The changes to the investment rules were earlier reported by the Times newspaper.

Turkey’s Automobile Joint Venture Group Inc., or TOGG, which comprises five companies and a business umbrella organization, will establish a factory in the manufacturing hub of Bursa, according to a presidential decree in the official gazette. The 22 billion liras ($3.7 billion) investment will enable the production of five models and a total output of 175,000 vehicles a year.
The first, a C-SUV, will be introduced in 2022, according to TOGG’s website. The group has been dropping hints about what it will look like on its Twitter page for days. The car was designed by Italy’s Pininfarina SpA, Dunya newspaper reported on Dec. 11.
The project is expected to contribute $50 billion to the Turkish economy in the 15 years following 2022, according to Mehmet Gurcan Karakas, the chief executive officer of the consortium.
The investment will enjoy comprehensive tax cuts, free land allocation, interest rate reductions and a government purchase guarantee of 30,000 vehicles until the end of 2035, according to the decree. Investors are obliged to provide at least 3.5 billion liras in cash as capital by the end of 2023.
Erdogan, who drove the prototype SUV after a ceremony on Friday to unveil the designs, said the car represents the culmination of Turkey’s progress in industrial technology.
Erdogan first urged Turkish companies to join forces to manufacture a domestic vehicle nine years ago, saying in Jan. 2011 that he was “looking for a brave fellow, an investor for a domestic car.” More than six years after that call, a consortium, which includes Anadolu Group, BMC, Kok Group, Turkcell and Zorlu Holding, was established. Turkey is already a major auto-parts maker.
Turkey was the ninth-biggest car market in Europe as of November, according to data from the Automotive Distributors’ Association. A total of 316,427 cars were sold in the country in the first 11 months of 2019, down 26% from the same period a year earlier.

The decision comes as China steps up regulation over auto sales in the world's biggest vehicle market, where more than 28 million cars were sold last year.
The anti-monopoly bureau of State Administration for Market Regulation said that between 2015 and 2018, the Japanese carmaker set a minimum sales and resale price for its cars in coastal Jiangsu province, which deprived dealers of pricing autonomy and harmed customers' rights.
Lexus also fixed sales strategies in the region over the period, including offering customers discounts while asking them to purchase accessories at fixed prices, a sales tactic usual among individual auto dealers in China but frowned upon for carmakers.
A spokesman at Toyota, Lexus' parent firm, told Reuters the firm acknowledged the penalty and respects the decision. He did not comment further.
China's auto sales are declining, but Lexus' sales keep growing. It sold 180,200 vehicles in the first 11 months this year, a 21% jump from a year earlier.
In June, China's market regulator imposed an 162.8 million yuan fine on Ford Motor Co's (N:F) joint venture with Changan Automobile Group (SZ:000625) for violating anti-monopoly law.

1057,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 08:59AM ET</span>",Tesla to Deliver Its First China-Built Electric Cars Monday,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. will start delivering China-built cars on Monday, a major milestone for Elon Musk’s company as it mounts a push to expand in the world’s largest electric-vehicle market.
The first 15 units of Model 3 sedans assembled at Tesla’s new multi-billion-dollar Shanghai plant — it’s first outside the U.S. — will be delivered to company employees on Dec. 30, a Tesla representative said by phone on Friday.
Chief Executive Officer Musk is counting on the China plant to help build on recent momentum for the company in the world’s largest market both for EVs and autos in general. The Model 3 will compete with electric cars from local contenders such as NIO Inc. and Xpeng Motors, as well as global manufacturers including BMW AG and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn).
The Shanghai Gigafactory, which only broke ground at the start of this year, is a crucial test of Musk’s bid to keep his carmaker profitable as he bets big on Chinese appetite for electric cars. Originally just a muddy plot about a 90-minute drive away from Shanghai’s city center, Musk has said he’s never seen a factory built so quickly.
With Tesla’s volatile stock price and strained finances, investors will be watching closely how the ramp-up unfolds. The multibillion-dollar investment will be a deciding factor to determine whether Tesla will be able to take on local competitors and fend off challenges by the likes of Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi.
The shares gained 0.9% in pre-market trading in New York as of 7:53 a.m. local time.
The launch will also provide clues about Tesla’s ability to truly go global. The company is planning to follow up with a production facility in Europe, where it is enjoying burgeoning sales growth in several markets.
Musk has predicted Tesla will make at least 1,000 cars a week in Shanghai by the end of the year — a volume the company’s original factory in California spent months trying to hit — and has said a weekly rate of 3,000 is a target at some point.
Earlier Friday, the China-built Model 3 was included on a list of vehicles qualifying for an exemption from a 10% purchase tax in the country. Tesla said in October the locally built Model 3 will be priced from about $50,000. Further helping Tesla, the China-built model this month qualified for a government subsidy of as much as about 25,000 yuan ($3,600) per vehicle.
The company may lower the price of the locally assembled sedans by 20% or more next year as it starts using more local components and reduces costs, people familiar with the matter have said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) said Tadashi Yanai, founder and CEO of Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing (T:9983), will resign as independent board member at the end of the month after 18 years on the job to focus on his fashion business.
A longtime ally and sometime critic of SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, the billionaire is one of only three external members of a board filled with SoftBank executives and heads of its portfolio companies.
The resignation comes at a time when SoftBank is battling with the fallout from the failed IPO of WeWork, with Son saying he misjudged co-founder Adam Neumann's character and pledging to strengthen corporate governance at the group's investments.
However, experts are critical of SoftBank's governance, saying it has few truly independent voices that can question Son's judgement.
""They have low governance standards,"" said Nicholas Benes of The Board Director Training Institute of Japan, a non-profit focused on corporate governance training.
""If they don't require higher standards of themselves, it might be hard to require them of investee companies,"" he said in an interview last month.
Son in November defended the board's rigour after reporting the group's first quarterly loss in 14 years, saying that Yanai was among the board members who excoriated him for the WeWork investment.
""Almost all the board members gave me a hard time. I ended up being very exhausted,"" he said.
Yanai, Japan's richest man, along with Son, are among a handful of Japanese founder-CEOs who are also household names.
Yanai was known for being willing to voice his dissent at some of Son's decisions.
His successor has not been decided, a SoftBank spokeswoman said.
SoftBank lost one of its most outspoken voices when another outside director, Shigenobu Nagamori, founder and CEO of  Nidec Corp  (T:6594), stepped down two years ago.
The other independent directors currently on SoftBank's board are Masami Iijima, chairman of trading house Mitsui & Co (T:8031), and professor Yutaka Matsuo from the University of Tokyo, a highly renowned artificial intelligence expert with little corporate experience.
Both Yanai and Son have made and then shelved plans to hand over the reins of their companies in the past, with 70-year-old Yanai previously saying he would retire at 65.
Yanai has said he does not want either of his two sons to take over as CEO, but both were promoted and joined the ranks of company directors last year.
Possible successors named by media have included finance chief Takeshi Okazaki and Pan Ning, the head of Uniqlo's China operations, as well as Maki Akaida, head of Uniqlo's Japan operations."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese luxury liquor maker Kweichow  Moutai  (SS:600519) will open a new e-commerce company next year after abruptly shutting its old one, as it pursues a revamp following the arrest of its former chairman, local media reported on Friday.
The company's Moutai liquor is often served at official banquets and business dinners and has seen demand surge as China's burgeoning middle-class gets a taste for pricier drinks. Its fiery Feitian 53 baijiu sells for close to $250 per bottle.
In May, the company's former chairman Yuan Renguo was dismissed from his posts and expelled from the ruling Communist Party after being accused by the party's graft buster of offences including taking bribes. Reuters has not been able to contact Yuan to comment on the allegations.
Yuan's ousting came amid a broader campaign against corruption led by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Moutai's current chairman, Li Baofang, has launched a package of reforms with a focus on standardizing its extensive network of distributors at a time when demand for the company's liquor exceeds supply.
Local media outlets such as financial magazine Caixin have reported this year that Moutai's lucrative distribution business had been plagued with graft due to the high returns distributors could get from obtaining a license from the firm.
The company, which could not be reached for comment on Friday, shut its e-commerce platform ten days ago, without giving a reason.
In a meeting with distributors on Friday, Li said the company would relaunch a revamped version next year, according to local media such as the state-owned China Securities Journal.
Recent results reports show the liquor maker stopped cooperating with 607 dealers in 2018, and 597 more in the first half of this year, cutting the total number of dealers to 2,415.
It also established a wholly-owned subsidiary sales office earlier this year to sell directly to customers.
The Shanghai-listed firm has seen its share price almost double this year, making it one of the most expensive companies in China and the world’s most valuable spirits company.
Last week, Li said at another event with distributors that sales revenue had reached 100 billion yuan this year.
The company expects to sell 34,500 tons of Moutai in 2020, up 11% on this year, according to a stock market filing on Friday."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks scaled record highs on Friday and oil prices stayed buoyant in a holiday-shortened week, as optimism grew that a U.S.-China trade deal would soon be signed.
Traders returned from their Christmas and Boxing Day break to digest comments from Beijing that it was in close contact with Washington about an initial trade agreement. Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump had talked up a signing ceremony for the recently struck phase-one trade deal.
Rising to another record high, European shares were on course for their best year since the financial crisis. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.2%, helped by gains in export-heavy German shares (GDAXI). The benchmark index has reached record highs for three sessions in a row.
The FTSE 100 (FTSE), set for its best run in three years, added 0.4%. Mining companies (FTNMX1770) provided the biggest boost, with  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN) and BHP Group Plc (L:BHPB) climbing about 2% each.
The positive tone was set in Asia. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped 0.8% to 555.39, a level not seen since mid-2018. It is up 15.5% so far this year.
China's blue-chip (CSI300) was down 0.1%, although for the week the index was up 0.1%.
Profits at industrial companies in China in November grew at the fastest pace in eight months, breaking a three-month declining streak, as production and sales quickened. But broad weakness in domestic demand remains a risk for earnings next year, say analysts.
The rally in global shares contrasts with a plunge late last year, when the Sino-U.S. trade war had sapped investor confidence. The worries scuttled capital expenditure plans over much of 2019, but strong employment and signs of an improving global economy suggest that will change next year.
The U.S. Federal Reserve's policy easing, economic data that have come in above expectations, and corporate profits have helped lift stocks this year, along with trade-related optimism. Markets are now waiting for January's fourth-quarter financial results to see whether sentiment among companies has improved.
But some analysts are wary about risks ahead in 2020.
""The trade war ... is far from over,"" Piotr Matys, FX strategist at Rabobank, wrote in a research note. ""In our view, this is just a temporary truce. Another unsolved major issue is Brexit. Geopolitical risk can suddenly resurface.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Japan's Nissan Motor Co has told its managers to slash non-essential spending as the automaker grapples with slumping car sales and tumbling profits, three company sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The penny-pinching drive is in place for the rest of financial year until end-March and will most likely continue into the coming business year, they said. 
Managers have been told to put the kibosh on unnecessary travel, sales incentives and promotional events to ""conserve every yen,"" as one source put it.
Meetings that three or four people would once have traveled to attend in person, might now only have one Nissan representative, the sources said, while other gatherings and dinners have been canceled altogether or replaced by video-conferencing.The extensive spending cuts come in tandem with Nissan's decision this month to order a two-day furlough for U.S. employees Jan. 2-3. There is also an effective travel ban for staff in the United States, where sales have been particularly hard hit, one source said.
While the automaker is not facing any cash crunch, the actions underscore a deepening sense of crisis at Nissan which has been rocked by the ouster of scandal-hit leader Carlos Ghosn, the departure of other top executives and strained relations with alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
In April, it embarked on a wide-ranging turnaround plan to revive sales and boost profits but the business outlook has worsened more than anticipated, the sources said. In November, it reported 70% slide in second-quarter operating profit and cut its full-year forecast to an 11-year low.
The de facto freeze on non-essential spending is ""increasingly a modus operandi at Nissan globally,"" a second source said, adding: ""The house is not on fire, but there's something smoldering."" 
The three sources declined to be identified as Nissan has not publicly disclosed the extent of the cuts.
A Yokohama-based Nissan spokesman said: ""Given the business and operational situation we face, we're carrying out moves to cut expenses."" 
The sources stressed that the automaker had sufficient cash resources.
According to a fourth Nissan source, the automaker has good credit lines and plenty of cash, including money in China, which he said is years of accumulated profit from Nissan's China joint-venture operations.
This week Nissan's stock hit lows not seen since September 2011 after Jun Seki, its vice chief operating officer and a former contender for CEO, said he was leaving the firm to become the president of Nidec Corp.

On Friday, the automaker named executive officer Hideyuki Sakamoto as a candidate for the board of directors following Seki's resignation.

Italy's banks have been shedding their worst-performing loans over the past few years to comply with regulatory demands to tackle the legacy of a deep recession, but have now turned to unlikely-to-pay (UTP) loans which are not yet in default but are unlikely to be recovered in full.
Under the agreement, the banks and AMCO will transfer small to medium sized real-estate UTP loans repackaged as securities to a new fund for an initial value of around 450 million euros ($501 million), AMCO and Prelios said in a statement.
This will allow banks and AMCO to spin-off these credits form their 2019 full-year results, they said, adding they targeted a 1.5 billion euro final portfolio for the fund.
Prelios will manage the fund.
AMCO, which is fully owned by the Treasury, has grown to play a key role in Italy's bad loan market after taking on the impaired debts of two regional lenders wound down in 2017.
Earlier this year it bought a portfolio of soured loans with a gross book value of 2.8 billion euros from ailing lender Banca Carige (MI:CRGI), and it prepares.
According to sources, AMCO could also take on some 10 billion euros in impaired debt from Monte dei Paschi, in a deal which Italy has been negotiating for months with EU competition authorities.

1067,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 05:08AM ET</span>",Tesla set to begin deliveries of China-made Model 3 cars on Dec. 30,"By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) will begin delivering Model 3 vehicles built at its Shanghai factory on Monday, a company representative told Reuters. 
Construction of its first plant outside the United States began in January and production started in October. It aims to produce 250,000 vehicles a year after production of the Model Y is added in the initial phase.
The first 15 customers to get the cars on Dec 30 are Tesla employees, the company representative added. 
The delivery date of Dec. 30 means that the plant will start delivering cars to customers just 357 days after the factory's construction started, which will mark a new record for global automakers in China. 
The China-made cars are priced at 355,800 yuan ($50,000) before subsidies and Tesla has said it wants to start deliveries before Chinese new year beginning on Jan. 25. 
The Shanghai plant is part of the Silicon Valley automaker's plans to bolster its presence in the world's biggest auto market and minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war. 
The carmaker already treats China, the world's biggest electric vehicle market where 1.3 million new-energy vehicles were sold last year, differently than elsewhere, with offerings such as racing events and showroom parties.
It is also building service centers and charging stations across China to assure customers of standardized after-sales service, Reuters reported last month.
The Chinese government has also been supportive of the factory, which is China's first wholly foreign-owned car plant and a reflection of the government's broader shift to open up its car market.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Friday said it had added Tesla's China-made Model 3 to a list of new energy vehicles exempt from purchase tax. 

The ministry had said in August it had exempted all of Tesla's models from purchase tax.

1069,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 04:18AM ET</span>",U.S. energy shareholders seek to leave behind a lost decade,"By Lewis Krauskopf and Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 2010s was a lost decade for shares of U.S. energy companies overall. Volatile commodity prices amid growing supply, poor financial performance and disfavor from some investor groups all contributed to the energy sector's transformation from investor darling to investor outcast.
Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/318/318/Pasted%20Image.jpg 
U.S. crude prices (CLc1) fell more than 20% during the 2010s, while the rise of alternative energy also brought pressure, with some stock buyers shunning fossil fuel investments as socially irresponsible.
But with the dawn of a new decade, some investors say the sun is also rising on energy shares.
The energy sector's swoon defied a boom in U.S. domestic oil production, sparked by the advent of hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking."" Ten years ago, the United States was a net importer of about 10 million barrels per day of oil and fuels. It ends the decade poised to become a net exporter of oil and fuel products.
""It really is a great irony that at a time when the United States became the world’s biggest producer and has become a great exporter, that investors have become skeptical and have adopted a position of ‘show me the money,’” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit.
“Industry is having to demonstrate that it can deliver those returns over several quarters, not just one quarter, so they’re going through a real testing period right now,"" Yergin said.
The S&P 500 energy sector (SPNY) registered a meager 6% gain this decade, compared with a more than 180% rise for the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, according to Refinitiv data.
Including dividends, the energy sector's total return rises to roughly 39%. But that pales in comparison to the S&P 500's over 250% total return and is only slightly above the roughly 37% return of the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA Merrill Lynch Treasury index <.MERG0Q0>, a barometer of U.S. Treasury bond performance.
Over the past decade, including estimates for 2019, the energy sector’s total earnings have declined 14.8%, while all other major sectors have seen growth of at least 28%, according to Refinitiv data.
The energy sector's poor performance means its importance to the stock market has withered away.
Energy represents less than 5% of the weight of the overall S&P 500, down from over 15% in mid 2008, when U.S. crude prices topped $140 a barrel, according to Refinitiv data.
As a result, investors seeking overall stock market exposure require a smaller allocation of energy shares, another pressure point for the group.
Even so, the decade was transformational for the oil-and-gas industry, which flocked to booming fields in west Texas and North Dakota.
U.S. crude oil production, which was just over 5 million barrels per day (bpd) at the decade's outset, surged to a record 13 million bpd by the decade's end, leading to an abundance of supply that has pressured prices, while natural gas output also is setting records.
""The price of energy has been lower than it would have been had none of this occurred,"" said Pearce Hammond, managing director at Simmons Energy in Houston.
""It never benefited the energy companies,"" he added. ""Why? Because they outspent cash flow and they didn’t deliver any kind of real returns. They were just huge sinks of capital.""
But as 2020 arrives, some investors believe the energy sector will leave its struggles behind.
“We have seen crude go to $60 and yet the energy stocks trade as if oil is at $40,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.
Investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates is among those betting on energy shares. It is overweight the energy sector after buying shares of companies that include  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (N:MPC), the firm's president, Alan Lancz, said.
A ""perfect storm"" of macroeconomic factors pressured commodity prices - including the strong U.S. dollar and slowing economies in emerging markets - as well as more recently a fear of eventual increased U.S. regulations that has sparked more drilling, Lancz said. But he thinks both macro and political factors are poised to ease over the next year.

“We see over a two-, three-year period a gradual recovery in this whole sector that has been unduly depressed,” Lancz said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) has selected executive officer Hideyuki Sakamoto as a candidate for the board of directors, the company said on Friday, following the surprise resignation of vice-chief operating officer Jun Seki earlier this week.
Sakamoto, who was named an executive officer in June and has been an executive vice president since 2014, is responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management at Japan's No. 2 automaker. Nissan will hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting on Feb. 18, where his appointment will be among proposals submitted for approval, it said in a press release.
The carmaker did not say whether Sakamoto would take on Seki's responsibilities. 
Nissan needs stability as it braces for its worst annual profit in 11 years amid slumping sales in the United States and China, its biggest markets. The company is also working to repair ties with top shareholder and alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), which deteriorated following the ouster of joint chairman Carlos Ghosn a year ago.
The abrupt departure of Seki, part of Nissan's newly appointed three-person leadership team and the executive charged with leading the recovery plan, sent the carmaker's shares to an eight-year low on Wednesday. He will join motor-maker  Nidec Corp  (T:6594) as president.
Seki, Chief Executive Makoto Uchida and Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta officially took over on Dec. 1, but sources say they failed to immediately gel. Renault is due to name a new CEO in the coming weeks as well.
Nissan's top ranks have seen upheaval several times in the 13 months since Ghosn's arrest on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies. Hiroto Saikawa resigned as CEO in September after he admitted to being improperly overpaid.
Nissan embarked on its wide-ranging restructuring plan in April, attempting to draw a line under the costly expansion pursued by Ghosn. It plans to ax nearly one-tenth of its workforce and cut global vehicle production by 10% through 2023.
Nissan, Renault and third partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp need to leverage their alliance as automakers globally ramp up spending on new technologies like electrification and autonomous driving. 
Renault in October ousted CEO Thierry Bollore, who was close to Ghosn and had strained ties with former Nissan counterpart Saikawa. New Nissan chief Uchida is known for having close ties to the French automaker.

The three companies earlier this month named Hadi Zablit to the newly created position of general secretary of the automaking alliance, charging him with boosting efficiencies and maximizing profit benefits for the partners.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.2% at 0804 GMT. The index has now hit record highs for three consecutive sessions in a holiday-shortened week.
Data on Friday showed profits at China's industrial firms rose at the fastest pace in eight months in November. The news added to a broader rally, fueled by an initial U.S.-China trade deal and hopes of a smoother Brexit.
Beijing said this week it was in close contact with Washington about their Phase 1 agreement, following comments from U.S. President Donald Trump about a formal signing ceremony.
The deal is widely expected to be signed in early January.
Still, with no other major updates expected this year either on the trade front or on future Brexit negotiations, volumes are expected to remain light until the first full week of January.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings cannot escape an aging society or low interest rates, but the Japanese investment bank might be able to wring more money out of advisory and underwriting as it grapples with the long-term ""megatrends"", its outgoing chief executive said.
The comments from Koji Nagai, Nomura's longest-serving CEO in three decades, underscore the deepening sense of crisis for Japan's top brokerage and investment bank amid a shrinking fee pool from trading that threatens financial services in the world's third-largest economy.
Nagai is due to become Nomura's chairman in April and will be replaced by Kentaro Okuda, now co-chief operating officer, to lead a turnaround at the firm, which last year posted its first annual loss in a decade, has cut costs and also announced plans to shut 20% of its domestic retail branches.
The headwinds from the ""megatrends"" will stay for another decade, Nagai said, indicating Nomura needs to focus on its primary business that include underwriting and deal advising.
Already, Nomura has announced it will buy Greentech Capital Advisors, a U.S. mergers and acquisitions advisory firm which specializes in renewable energy.
The size of the Greentech deal was not disclosed, although the Nikkei newspaper put it at 10 billion yen ($91 million).
""This is really a business chance and unavoidable theme for us,"" Nagai said in the interview last week which was embargoed for release on Friday.
The new CEO will also keep trying to meet cost-cutting goals, Nagai said. Nomura is aiming for about 140 billion yen in cost cuts by March 2022, with about 60% achieved as of December.
Okuda has said he wants to speed up the pace of reform with ""a sense of urgency"", but has not provided details.
A senior company source says Nomura is likely to sharpen its focus on its domestic retail business as that could be a strong source of revenue.
Nomura posted a 57% year-on-year plunge in retail investment pretax profit in the quarter to September.
A three-decade bank veteran, Okuda, 56, has worked overseas, including as head of Nomura's U.S. arm.
When asked about Okuda's lack of experience in the domestic retail business, outgoing chief Nagai said it would be ""short-sighted"" to judge his potential ability based on such factors.

The 10-year yield slid 7 basis points to 6.51%, taking the weekly decline to nine basis points.
The Reserve Bank of India is embracing a Federal Reserve-style Operation Twist, where it buys long-end debt while selling short-end bonds after five rate cuts this year failed to lift economic growth. It will conduct a second operation on Monday, following on its first such move earlier this week.
The unprecedented move has put a stop to the relentless steepening in India’s yield curve, as investors dumped long-end debt on concern the government will add to record bond sales.
The RBI will buy 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) of 2029 bonds through an auction on Dec. 30, it said late Thursday. It plans to sell a total 100 billion rupees of debt maturing in 2020.

SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - As China struggles to deal with the slowdown of the world’s second-largest economy, it has embarked on a new strategy of placing financial experts in provinces to manage risks and rebuild regional economies.
Since 2018, President Xi Jinping has put 12 former executives at state-run financial institutions or regulators in top posts across China's 31 provinces，regions and municipalities, including some who have grappled with banking and debt difficulties that have raised fears of financial meltdown.
Only two top provincial officials had such financial background before the last big leadership reshuffle in 2012, according to Reuters research.
Among financial experts recently promoted is Beijing vice mayor Yin Yong, a former deputy central bank governor, and Shandong deputy provincial governor Liu Qiang, who rose through the country's biggest commercial banks, from Agricultural Bank of China to Bank of China.
Another newly promoted official, Chongqing vice mayor Li Bo, had until this year led the central bank's monetary policy department.
The appointments - overseeing economies larger than those of small countries - would appear to put those officials in the fast lane as China prepares a personnel reshuffle in 2022, when about half of the 25 members of the Politburo could be replaced, including Liu He, a vice-premier who is leading economic reform while doubling as chief negotiator in U.S. trade talks.
IN DEMAND
""Bankers are now in demand, as local governments are increasingly exposed to financial risks,"" said Chucheng Feng, a partner at Plenum, an independent research platform in Hong Kong.
""These ex-bankers and regulators are given the task of preventing and mitigating major financial risks.""
The appointments have come as economic growth has slowed to its weakest in nearly three decades, while government infrastructure investment has fallen.
Five regional banks were hit with management or liquidity problem this year, raising the prospect of devastating debt bombs lurking in unexpected corners.
""We need to be well prepared with contingency plans,"" the state Xinhua news agency said after a major annual economic meeting headed by Xi this month.
The economy faced ""increasing downward economic pressure amid intertwined structural, institutional and cyclical problems"", the news agency said.
With pressures mounting, local governments are expecting to take the lead in managing their financial scares and cutting the cost of rescue with local intervention, analysts say.
""Appointing financial vice governors to provinces can help better integrate financial policies into local practice, and to prevent financial risks beforehand,"" said He Haifeng, director of Institute of Financial Policy at Chinese Academy of Social Science, a government think-tank.
""Such appointments have also showcased a change of manner in official appointments.""
WORTH WATCHING
Financial executives were long shunned for leadership positions.
Banks were nationalized after the Communist Party took power in 1949 and many bankers were purged during the Cultural Revolution.
Xi started to stress the importance of financial expertise, and to elevate the status of executives, in 2017.
""Political cadres, especially the senior ones, must work hard to learn financial knowledge and be familiar with financial sectors,"" Xi said in a national meeting on financial affairs.
Half of the 12 former financial executives elevated to provincial leadership posts under Xi were born after 1970.
Liaoning's vice governor Zhang Lilin, 48, a veteran banker who spent two decades in the country's third largest lender, Agricultural Bank of China, was appointed days after three state-controlled financial institutions announced investment in the then troubled Bank of Jinzhou.
A risk disposal plan for the lender was a milestone this year in resolving problems facing high-risk financial institutions.
Tan Jiong, 53, former deputy head of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest lender by assets, was appointed in September to Guizhou.
The mountainous southwestern province is the most indebted province in China, according to a report from Guosen Securities, with a debt ratio of 161.7% as of the end of 2017.
To be sure, some top political figures had in the past cut their teeth in the finance industry.
Vice President Wang Qishan was governor of the state-owned China Construction Bank in the early 1990s.
But the increasing numbers of financial executives taking top jobs signals a new avenue for promotion in China's one-party system, where leaders often spend years working their way up through provincial governments.
""For those who look beyond 2022, these officials are worth attention and they could be part of the new generation of leadership after Xi,"" said Feng.
""Central government will likely keep these officials in the local governments and promote them, and they have a higher chance of moving up the ladder."""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Astellas Pharma Inc (T:4503) has bought U.S.-based Xyphos Biosciences Inc to expand its immuno-oncology business, a deal worth up to $665 million including potential development milestones and its second acquisition announced this month.
Japan's second biggest drugmaker by sales paid $120 million upfront for Xyphos and the rest will be milestone payments, the companies said in a statement.
Astellas also said this month it had agreed to purchase Audentes Therapeutics Inc for about $3 billion to expand its push into genetic medicines. The deal is due to close in January.
Immuno-oncology, which seeks to use the body's own defense systems to fight cancer, is a primary focus for Astellas and under the deal, the Japanese firm will gain Xyphos' cell therapy technology platform and its research team.
""Combining this technology with our capabilities in cell therapy that we have been working on so far, we can create next-generation high-function cells and maximize the value of our technology,"" Astellas President Kenji Yasukawa said in the statement.
Xyphos' proprietary molecules can be delivered to natural immune cells or to engineered Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) cells to generate immunotherapies for oncology.
Xyphos' first CAR cell product candidate is in preclinical development and is scheduled to be tested in a first-in-human clinical study in 2021, the statement said.
Both Xyphos and Audentes are based in San Francisco, a hub for biotech companies that are fetching huge premiums for global pharma companies eager to bolster their drug pipelines.
Japanese companies have agreed to more than 30 overseas acquisitions worth about $6 billion in the healthcare sector this year, according to Refinitiv data. That's still dwarfed by the $59 billion takeover of Britain's  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP) by Japanese market leader Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (T:4502) announced in 2018.
Astellas' purchase of Audentes was its second biggest on record after its 2010 purchase of OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc for $3.8 billion.
In the wake of the Audentes deal, Moody's put its A1 ratings on Astellas under review for a downgrade, saying the company's willingness to use debt to fund the purchase, worth 8 times the target's book equity, signaled an ""an urgency for Astellas to feed its long-term product pipeline.""

1080,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 26, 2019 10:41PM ET</span>",China Bucks Global Research Cuts as Analyst Count Hits Record,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s brokerages have a record number of analysts on the rolls after a fourth straight year of hiring, bucking a global trend of investment banks scaling back on research.
Analysts registered with the Securities Association of China climbed to 3,225 as of Dec. 26, an increase of 8% from 2018. By comparison, headcount at 12 major global banks shrank 8% to 3,500, on pace for the sharpest annual decrease since research firm Coalition Development started collating the numbers in 2012.
The divergence underscores seismic shifts in China’s $21 trillion capital markets. Rising foreign fund inflows as well as an uptick in stock and bond issuance have boosted demand for analysis on everything from the macro economy and industries to fixed-income and commodities. Policy makers are also pushing local brokerages to become more competitive in preparation for a build-up by Wall Street giants including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.
Research is becoming a core offering with even smaller firms building teams, said Liu Yuanrui, president of Changjiang Securities Co., a mid-size brokerage based in central China, which had over 90 analysts. “Every company realizes it needs one.”
Globally, research has been buffeted by changes in technology and the demands of the marketplace with the rise of automation and passive funds -- trends that have been slower to catch on in China.
European rules known as MiFID II spurred the most recent wave of job cuts by forcing research costs to be separated from trading fees. Chinese firms focus on the vast domestic retail market and are largely shielded from MiFID II, which only applies to banks and brokerages that interact with European asset managers.
That’s not to say analysts in China has been insulated from bad news. Compensation structures at local brokerages rely heavily on commission income from funds, something that’s been falling away since the market rout of 2015.
Salary Cuts
The dwindling commission pool has pressured salaries lower. About 45% of respondents to a recent New Fortune magazine survey of over 1,000 analysts reported a salary cut over the past year, with almost a fifth saying their compensation declined by over 20%.
Analysts have been forced to focus on professional rankings to signal their abilities and boost earnings. While run-of-the-mill analysts with five years of experience make the equivalent of about $75,000 a year in China, someone on the New Fortune rankings, a hyper-competitive version of the Institutional Investor poll and China’s biggest analyst contest, could easily take home $1 million or more.
The ploy came under regulatory fire last year amid rising questions about how analysts behaved in order to secure votes for the competition. New Fortune suspended last year’s contest before resuming it in October with much less fanfare.
Despite the questions around commissions and compensation, new research departments are popping up at smaller brokerages such as Kaiyuan Securities Co. with China’s financial liberalization building optimism about new lines of business.
The Nasdaq-style STAR market launched to much fanfare earlier this year and brokers are looking for increased demand from newcomers to the asset management space, including banks’ wealth management units and foreign institutional investors.
Still, Changjiang’s Liu doesn’t expect a significant pick up in income unless brokerages change their business models.
“Firms have to rethink the function of research teams because more profits cannot be derived from the current model,” he said.

The company had named Luttig, who has served as general counsel since joining the company in 2006, to the position of counselor and senior adviser to former Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg and to Boeing's board. (https://reut.rs/3778A6U)
Luttig, often listed among the highest paid general counsels of publicly traded companies, helped anchor Boeing's legal defense over the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within a span of five months.
Luttig's announcement to retire follows Muilenburg's dismissal as chief executive officer this week, after repeatedly failing to contain the fallout from the crashes that halted output of its best-selling jetliner.

Chairman David Calhoun, a former  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) executive who has been on Boeing's board since 2009, replaced Muilenburg as the chief executive officer effective Jan. 13.

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Global stocks rally to record highs; gold gains,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global equity markets and Wall Street's three major indices finished at all-time highs on Thursday in light holiday trade as a year-end rally advanced further on optimism over a U.S.-China trade agreement.
Oil rose to three-month highs, buoyed by a report showing lower U.S. crude inventories, hopes the pending Sino-U.S. trade deal will soon be signed and efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to curb crude supply.
Gold prices also rose.
MSCI's all-country world index and Wall Street's Dow Industrials, the benchmark S&P 500 and the technology-rich Nasdaq all closed at record highs.
Boxing Day holidays closed markets in Commonwealth countries around the world while a second Christmas Day shuttered markets in a swath of European countries.
Overnight in Asia, equity markets rose. China shares closed higher after Beijing laid out additional plans to bolster its economy, including infrastructure investments.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.38% to a record, on track for its best year since 2009. The index has gained 24% this year.
Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 105.94 points, or 0.37%, to 28,621.39. The S&P 500 (SPX) gained 16.53 points, or 0.51%, to 3,239.91 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 69.51 points, or 0.78%, to 9,022.39.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) closed up 0.15%, while Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 0.60%. Its emerging market index rose 0.28%, lifted by a 1.1% gain in Brazil's Bovespa (BVSP) index, which is up 33% for the year.
Wall Street was boosted by U.S.-China trade optimism and gains in Amazon.com (O:AMZN) after a report signaled robust online holiday sales.
Amazon shares jumped 4.4% after Mastercard (NYSE:MA) said U.S. shoppers spent more online during the holiday shopping season than in 2018, with e-commerce sales hitting a record.
The S&P 500, up 29% so far this year, is less than four-tenths of 1 percentage point shy of its best annual gain since 1997.
Investors in major equity markets around the world have chalked up strong gains this year, marking a contrast to a plunge late last year, noted Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone Financial Inc in New York.
""People are pretty happy with this year,"" he said.
Fourth-quarter earnings will soon come into focus in January, which should highlight whether sentiment among corporate management has improved, Abbasi said.
Recession fears scuttled capital expenditure plans during much of 2019, but strong employment and signs of an improving global economy suggest that will change next year.
The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell last week in a sign of ongoing labor market strength.
A spokesman for China's commerce ministry said Chinese and U.S. officials are in close touch and going through necessary procedures before signing a Phase 1 trade deal.
Gold prices rose to a two-month high. Spot gold added 0.8% to $1,510.98 an ounce.
Gold has been on the rise recently as a hedge against potential inflation, dollar weakness and increased equity market volatility in 2020, Abbasi said.
U.S. government debt yields fell after the Treasury Department sold $32 billion in seven-year notes to strong demand. The notes sold at a high yield of 1.855% in light trading volume.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last rose 4/32 in price to yield 1.8944%.
The auction comes after a $41 billion sale of five-year notes on Tuesday met strong demand and slightly soft interest in a $40 billion two-year note sale on Monday.
The dollar mostly edged lower, while oil gained. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose to a near two-week high as U.S.-China trade optimism sapped demand for safe-haven currencies.
The dollar index (DXY) fell 0.1%, with the euro (EUR=) up 0.1% to $1.1101. The yen weakened 0.25% versus the greenback at 109.64 per dollar.
Brent crude (LCOc1), the global benchmark, settled up 72 cents at $67.92 a barrel, the highest since Sept. 17. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (CLc1) crude gained 57 cents to settle at $61.68 a barrel.
Brent has rallied 25% in 2019, supported by supply cuts by OPEC and allies including Russia.
The American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry group, said late Tuesday that U.S. crude stocks fell by 7.9 million barrels last week, much more than analysts had forecast. [API/S]
U.S. gold futures settled 0.7% higher at $1,514.40 an ounce."
1089,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2019 04:26PM ET</span>","Nasdaq tops 9,000 on boosts from Amazon, trade optimism","By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - The Nasdaq crossed the 9,000-point mark for the first time on Thursday as all three major Wall Street indexes posted record closing highs, boosted by optimism over U.S.-China trade relations and gains in shares of Amazon.com after a report signaled robust online holiday sales.
Traders returned from the Christmas break to digest comments from Beijing that it was in close contact with Washington about an initial trade agreement, shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump talked up a signing ceremony for the recently struck Phase 1 trade deal.
Cooling U.S.-China trade tensions have fueled the latest leg of Wall Street's record-setting rally. With just days to go until the year-end, the benchmark S&P 500 is up 29% so far in 2019, which would be its biggest annual percentage gain since 2013.
The Nasdaq posted a record closing high for a 10th straight session, its longest such streak since 1997.
“The path of least resistance is up right now,"" said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer of Abbot Downing in Minneapolis. ""You have had a lot more clarity on certain things that had worried the market all year.""
Shares of Amazon (O:AMZN) jumped 4.4% after a Mastercard (NYSE:MA) report showed that U.S. shoppers spent more online during the holiday shopping season than in 2018, with e-commerce sales hitting a record high.
""The important part is that the online sales were much stronger than expected. The brick-and-mortar were less than expected, so the online sales, and principally Amazon, saved the day,"" said John Conlon, director, equity strategy at People's United Advisors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 105.94 points, or 0.37%, to 28,621.39, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 16.53 points, or 0.51%, to 3,239.91 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 69.51 points, or 0.78%, to 9,022.39.
Consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) was the biggest gainer among the S&P 500 sectors, spurred by Amazon. Healthcare (SPXHC) was the lone sector in the red.
A 0.9% decline in shares of  Boeing Co  (N:BA), which has been dealing with fallout from the grounding of its 737 MAX jet, weighed particularly on the Dow.
The Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts as well as better-than-feared economic data and corporate profits have helped lift stocks this year along with trade-relations optimism.
A Labor Department report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell last week in a sign of ongoing labor market strength. 
About 4.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well below the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.
Trading volumes are expected to remain thin during the holiday-shortened week.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and 27 new lows.

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2019 04:02PM ET</span>",Turkey's Halkbank fails to halt U.S. prosecution for aiding Iran,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday rejected a request by Turkey's state-owned Halkbank to put on hold a federal prosecution accusing it of helping Iran evade U.S. economic sanctions.
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said Halkbank would not face irreparable harm if the case proceeded, and that limiting its economic and reputational damage ""may best be assured by Halkbank's speedy response to the criminal charges.""
Berman also said the public had a strong interest in a ""prompt adjudication"" of Halkbank's alleged role in a conspiracy to undermine the sanctions, including through the alleged transfer of $20 billion of otherwise restricted Iranian funds.
Lawyers for Halkbank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan declined to comment.
Halkbank has resisted entering a plea to the federal fraud and money laundering charges announced on Oct. 15.
The bank had asked Berman to stay the case until the federal appeals court in Manhattan decided whether it could make a ""special appearance"" to challenge the jurisdiction of U.S. courts without first entering a plea.
Berman ruled on Dec. 5 that a plea should come first.
The charges threatened to complicate U.S.-Turkish relations, and were announced one day after U.S. President Donald Trump sanctioned Turkey following its launch of a military offense against Kurdish-led militia in northeastern Syria.
U.S. prosecutors alleged that from 2012 to 2016, Halkbank and its executives used money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions.
They also said Halkbank engaged in transactions on Iran's behalf that would have exposed the bank to sanctions, including allowing revenue from oil and gas sales to be spent on gold, and facilitating sham purchases of food and medicine.
The U.S. Department of Justice has charged nine people in the alleged scheme.
They included former Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was convicted in January 2018 after another defendant, wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, pleaded guilty and testified against him.
Atilla returned to Turkey this year after leaving prison, and was named general manager of the Istanbul stock exchange.

The case is U.S. v. Halkbank, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 15-cr-00867.

Footfall up to 12 p.m. on Dec. 26, known in Britain as Boxing Day and a key date for retailers, was down 10.6% compared with the same period a year ago, market research company Springboard said, adding that bad weather had deterred shoppers.
High streets were most affected by the rainy weather with consumers reluctant to go out in the morning, Springboard said.
Black Friday sales in November and a growing number of people shopping online have reduced Boxing Day footfall in recent years. 
""Boxing Day is indisputably a less important trading day than it once was,"" said Diane Wehrle, Insights Director at Springboard, adding that the Boxing Day footfall was 10.9% lower than during Black Friday morning. 

Barclaycard, part of  Barclays  Bank PLC (L:BARC), has said Britons were set to spend £3.7 billion ($4.8 billion) in the post-Christmas sales -- £200 million less than last year -- partly due to environmental concerns, including about the impact of so-called ""fast fashion"".

The Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, said the proposed rule would require all drones operating in the United States to be compliant within three years. 
Congress directed the FAA in 2016 to issue regulations or guidance by July 2018 to permit the public, the FAA, law enforcement and others to remotely track and identify drones and their operators during flight.
The race has been on for companies to create drone fleets as a complement for online retailers. 
 United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) said in October that it won the government's first full approval to operate a drone airline, which gave it a lead in the nascent drone delivery business over rivals Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
Earlier this year, Alphabet's Wing, a sister unit of search engine Google, was the first company to get U.S. air carrier certification for a single-pilot drone operation. It is testing home deliveries in a rural area around Blacksburg, Virginia.

Amazon, known for its splashy drone delivery tests, also has won experimental certifications to test its drones.

(Reuters) - Despite a strong start to this decade in 2010, emerging market stocks underperformed developed market peers and were weighed down by events such as the Chinese market sell-off, debt crises in Turkey and Argentina and the Sino-U.S. trade war.
MSCI's index of emerging market stocks has risen just 15% since the start of 2010, while the MSCI World index delivered a massive 104% return in that period.
Thailand, Philippines and Taiwan led emerging markets, with gains of more than 50% each over the past decade, while Greece, Turkey and Czech Republic bottomed the list with negative returns. 
The period from 2010 to this December also saw turbulent foreign portfolio flows into emerging markets as overseas investors balked during periodic swings in risk appetite, including a period of rising U.S. interest rates as major central banks began to unwind their crisis-era stimulus.

Despite the volatility, share prices broadly kept pace with earnings growth. 
The MSCI EM index's forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio was at 11.8 at the end of November, compared with its 10-year average of 10.9. Its lowest was 8.5 in October 2011, and the high was 13.09 in January 2018.

The analysis showed that EM firms' profit growth lagged those of developed market firms for most part of the decade
China, Mexico and Thai firms had the highest median profit growth of 10% or more for the past 10 years, while Hungary, Egypt and Turkey had negative median growth.

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2019 08:51AM ET</span>",Indonesia to offer more airport management projects to foreign firms in 2020,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia next year will offer more airport management projects to foreign investors after awarding its first to a foreign company on Thursday, the transportation minister said.
The country handed over development and operatorship for 25 years of Komodo airport to a consortium of PT Cardig Aero Services (JK:CASS) and Singapore's Changi Airports International Pte Ltd.
The airport is in the town of Labuan Bajo on a tourist island that is home to Komodo dragons.
This marked the first time a consortium involving a foreign company was given operatorship of an airport in Indonesia, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said.
The consortium will invest 1.2 trillion rupiah ($86 million) over five years to expand the airport, including lengthening the runway to accommodate bigger planes likely to fly directly from countries such as China, Japan and India, and increasing its capacity by more than six-fold to handle 4 million passengers, Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi told a news conference.
The firms are also expected to spend 5.7 trillion rupiah over five years on its operation, while the government will provide a guarantee through a state-owned financial company, Sumadi said.
""This is a start for us to offer other (airports),"" Sumadi said.
""I'm asking for your support so we can reduce our dependence on the budget and continue to build infrastructure across the country,"" he said.
He listed the Kuala Namu airport on the outskirts of the city of Medan, North Sumatra, the Sam Ratulangi airport in Manado city in North Sulawesi, and an airport in Singkawang, West Kalimantan, as projects the government would offer in 2020.
Investment required at the first two airports amounted to up to 8 trillion rupiah, Sumadi said, adding that they already handle 14 million passengers and would be ideal entry points for tourists from the Middle East, China and India.
""We will also put on offer a railway project in South Sumatra, which has already received interest from South Korean companies,"" Sumadi said, adding the project was valued at an estimated 7-10 trillion rupiah.
President Joko Widodo has pledged to continue investing heavily in infrastructure in his second five-year term in office, which began in October.
His cabinet has estimated a total of $430 billion infrastructure investment will be spent between 2019-2024."

Last year, holiday sales in Asia-Pacific and the Americas fell 3% and 1% respectively, which Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Bogliolo attributed to a slowdown in tourism and softening demand among locals in its home market.
""We continued to see the Chinese Mainland drive our overall sales growth with a strong double-digit increase, offset by the persisting declines in the Hong Kong market and, to a lesser degree, Japan,"" Bogliolo said on Thursday.
""We are happy to see sales growth in the Americas, a momentum shift in the region,"" he added. 
Luxury retailers including Tiffany depend on China's burgeoning middle class that has found an appetite for expensive jewelry and handbags, as consumer demand remains subdued in the United States and Europe due to various geopolitical reasons. 
Slowing growth in China, mainly due to its prolonged trade war with the United States and a stronger dollar, has impacted sales for Tiffany, which relies on tourists from the world's second-largest economy.
Net sales in Asia-Pacific for the interim holiday period from Nov. 1 to Christmas Eve rose about 5%-7%, the company said. In the Americas, Tiffany expects net sales growth of 2% to 4%.
Sales in Japan, however, fell 9% to 11% during the period, hurt by the recent increase in the consumption tax.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2019 07:41AM ET</span>",Brazil could get S&P rating upgrade if deficit cut confirmed: lead analyst,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - S&P Global Ratings could boost Brazil's sovereign rating if a cut in its deficit as a percentage of GDP is confirmed, according to an interview published on Thursday with the credit firm's lead analyst for the country.
South America's largest economy needs to see reduced debt, higher economic growth and continued structural reforms in order to reclaim the investment grade rating it lost in 2015, S&P analyst Livia Honsel also told Folha de S.Paulo.
That will take time to accomplish, she said, without giving a timeframe.
S&P rates Brazil's foreign currency debt at BB-, three notches below investment grade. The agency changed its outlook to ""positive"" from ""stable"" this month.
Brazil's public sector deficit shrank to 1.27% of GDP in the 12 months to October, its lowest in a year.
""If this deficit reduction is confirmed in the next quarters, it could lead us to revise the rating to BB,"" Honsel told Folha.
""Another reason to hike the rating would be more strongly accelerating growth and a lower net external debt.""
Congressional approval of an overhaul to the pension system sent a good sign to investors, but further reforms are still needed, she said.
Plans for ""administrative reform,"" which changes rules for new public sector employees aimed at curbing federal expenditures, are essential, she said.
Honsel also listed giving Brazil's central bank increased autonomy as a measure that should be carried out in the short term.
Asked if S&P sees political risk given right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's criticism of the media and Economy Minister Paulo Guedes - in the context of unrest in neighboring countries - evoking a dictatorship-era decree to suppress dissent, Honsel said the firm takes more of a macroeconomic view.
""There can be political noise that will interfere a bit in the discussion, but in general, we try to look at the whole and where the economy is headed."""
1104,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 26, 2019 07:04AM ET</span>",Top 10 Investing Stories of the Decade,"Investing.com - The last 10 years were very kind to long-term equity investors. The major U.S. indexes are closing out the decade setting record highs, but it was hardly a smooth ride, with everything from flash crashing to Fed bashing.
Here’s a look at the top ten stories of the decade that investors keyed in on (and several others of note).
2010 – The Flash Crash
In “The Terminator” Skynet became self-aware in 1997. In the stock market the rise of the machines was evident in 2010 with the flash crash. The U.S. stock markets saw a rapid, unprecedented decline in May that took the Dow down 998.5 points in minutes.
But just as investors were preparing for the worst, the market righted itself and closed down just 3%. The plunge was exacerbated by algorithmic and high-frequency trading as the machines reacted to initial declines and the selling snowballed. When the official regulatory report came out in September, the cause was determined to be a $4.1 billion sell order by a mutual fund.
Also of note this year, the European debt crisis that eventually hit Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain, the explosion of a   BP   (LON:BP) oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, Tesla""s (NASDAQ:TSLA) IPO and the Federal Reserve announcing QE2.
2011 – Occupy Wall Street
Chants of “We Are the 99%!” reverberated around Wall Street in September as the anger over the impact of the financial crisis and widening income inequality turned into a movement. Occupy Wall Street protestors hunkered down in Zuccotti Park in lower Manhattan, staying for almost two months until they were forced out.
The protest was organized by anti-consumerist group Adbusters.
Also this year, the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the Arab Spring and the passing away of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder Steve Jobs.
2012 - Draghi Pledges ‘Whatever It Takes’
Euro zone countries were facing an avalanche of debt, but one man was ready to ride to the rescue, staving off what many saw as the imminent collapse of the single currency.
In a speech in London in July, ECB President Mario Draghi pledged to use any means necessary to save the euro.
“Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro,” he said. “And believe me, it will be enough.”
The EU is still pegged into negative interest rates now, but the euro is still a going concern.
Other big news this year were the Supreme Court upholding Obamacare, the Libor scandal and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) going public.
2013 – Gold Crashes
After 12-straight years of gains, a selloff in gold that many had been predicting for a while finally materialized. Gold prices tumbled more than 25%, going from $1,660 to around $1,200.
The global economy was back on surer footing and there was speculation that central banks would start a tightening cycle, hurting the non-yielding yellow metal. Prices were also hit hard in a two-day period on worries that Cyprus would liquidate its gold holdings.
Also this year, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followed Facebook to the public markets, Edward Snowden released secret NSA documents and Bitcoin started to really gain traction.
2014 – Alibaba IPO
Chinese e-commerce giant   Alibaba   (NYSE:BABA) cemented its place in market history in September when it became the biggest initial public offering. Taking into account the overallotment, or green shoe option, the company raised $25 billion as it debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares priced at $68 per share and saw an opening day pop, closing close to $94. The company’s record IPO haul was finally overtaken this year as   Saudi Aramco   (SE:2222), the state oil company, went public.
Also this year, oil prices were hit as the fracking boom began, Russia invaded Ukraine, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) paid nearly $17 billion to settle accusations of fraud leading up to the subprime collapse
2015 – China Stock Bubble Pops
The chart of the Shanghai Index for 2015 would make even the most seasoned rollercoaster rider a little queasy.
After a huge, fast run-up, equities in China nosedived just as fast. The reason was classically simple: valuations had just gotten way ahead of the businesses’ performance. The Chinese market, which is dominated by retail investors, had pushed up prices with borrowed money (with lots of encouragement from the state).
Devaluations in the renminbi didn’t help either and the government was forced into a series of extraordinary measures, including the possibility of imprisonment for short-selling.
All told, the Shanghai Composite tumbled from a little more than 4,600 in May to a little more than 3,000 in September.
Other news included the ECB beginning its bond-buying program, The Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) merger and Switzerland abandoning its peg to the euro.
2016 – Trump Elected President
While the immediate stock market impact when Donald Trump unexpectedly beat out Hillary Clinton for the U.S. presidency was fairly muted, Trump’s influence on not just the big-picture investing landscape but the day-to-day swings of the market has been huge.
There have been expected, market-pleasing moves like deregulation. There were unexpected, but also market-friendly things like the constant public bashing of the Fed and demands for lower rates. And there’s been moves that the jury is still out on, like a trade war with China that nevertheless have dictated trading.
Among other events that year were Brexit, the release of the Panama Papers and AT&T's (NYSE:T) purchase of Time Warner. 
2017 – Bitcoin’s Record High
Cryptocurrencies were already on the radar of the market before 2017, but the nosebleed-inducing rally of Bitcoin brought them into the everyday global consciousness as investing vehicles and not just the payment of choice for the dark web.
Bitcoin entered the year having never traded above $1,000. It lost no time in passing that milestone on its way to its record high near $20,000. That was a gain of more than 2,100%. It closed 2017 around $14,500.
Among other highlights were Trump’s tax cut, the Fed’s series of rate hikes and the appearance of the Fearless Girl statue facing the charging bull near Wall Street.
2018 – A Terrible Fourth Quarter
Few people saw the fourth-quarter 2018 stock-market slump coming. They won't forget it any time soon, with the Dow falling 11.8%, the S&P 500 dropping nearly 14% and the Nasdaq slumping 17.5%.
Including a horrifying 653-point drop in the Dow on Christmas Eve, it was the worst quarter since the 2008 crash.
The causes were multiple.

Oil prices fell more than a third, battering energy stocks.

Battered tech stocks, led by Apple's 30% decline after its market capitalization soared above $1 trillion in the summer. The problem was falling sales of its flagship iPhone.
Rising interest rates and the domestic economy that seemed to be softening.
International concerns, including the U.S.-China trade fight and the Brexit fights roiling the United Kingdom and Europe.
The market was overbought going into that fall.
With the Christmas Eve selloff, the market had fallen too far and too fast. That set up an astonishing rebound on Dec. 26, when the Dow soared 1,086 points. 
In other events that year, cryptocurrencies crashed back down to earth, NAFTA was cancelled and the fiduciary rule for financial advisers ended.
2019 – Cannabis Stocks Hammered
The optimism that comes with incredible promise slammed into the wall of reality and regulations in the cannabis sector in 2019.
As the first G7 country to legalize the weed near the end of 2018, Canadian cannabis companies raced into 2019 embracing the bold new and burgeoning global market. But with that head start came the daunting task of ramping up production, setting up international partnerships and worldwide expansion strategies all the while attempting to navigate regulatory hurdles that were not fully defined. The results saw cannabis stocks rocket to new highs and then steadily decline, racking up gut-cringing declines that ranged from 40% to 80%.
In the U.S., the passage of the the federal Farm Bill in late December 2018 gave the cannabis markets its upbeat start to the year unbridling the optimism that national legalization of marijuana moved from “if” to merely a function of “when.” But as 2019 comes to a close, the timeline is still unclear. Individual states, however, continued to embrace the movement.
Also this year, Trump was impeached, the U.S. continued to see record-low jobless numbers, protests engulfed Hong Kong, Uber (NYSE:UBER) went public and WeWork failed to do so."

Jiang Xiyun was convicted of corruption, receiving bribes, illegally issuing financial notes, and illegally destroying accounting vouchers and accounting books, according to the Yantai Intermediate People's Court.
The court verdict means that if Jiang commits no further crimes over the next two years, his sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment, according to Chinese law.
The Shandong-based bank is in the midst of a restructuring led by the government.
The lender has not released its annual report since 2017 due to management and liquidity issues.
The banking and insurance regulatory watchdog appointed its staff to head the bank in 2017, but the restructuring process has dragged since then.
Concerns over Hengfeng were rekindled by the state seizure of Baoshang Bank earlier this year and the state rescue of Bank of Jinzhou, sharpening concerns about the health of hundreds of small lenders as economic growth slows to near 30-year lows.
Hengfeng Bank said earlier this month that it would issue 100 billion shares through a private placement, in one of the largest state-led rescues of small Chinese banks.
Singapore's United Overseas Bank (SI:UOBH) has a stake in Hengfeng Bank."

The move from December 24 was disclosed by a filing approved on the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System and comes as China prioritizes implementing mixed ownership reforms to revamp its bloated, debt-ridden state sector.
China Southern is among 96 centrally owned companies supervised by the state assets regulator, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
As such, China Southern Airlines would offload its old freight unit to the newly registered company, according to a statement from SASAC in October. The cargo company would also take over other air cargo assets under the parent company such as belly cargo services, cargo terminals and international logistics.
The cargo business would be managed in a market-oriented way and would become a major source of profits, said the SASAC.
The air cargo market, an economic bellwether linked to global trade, saw its traffic decline by 3.3% in 2019, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said, driven by a tariff war between the United States and China.
In 2017, China Eastern Air Holding (SS:600115) sold almost half of its freight unit to four firms, while Air China (SS:601111) last year offloaded a majority stake in its cargo arm in face of market uncertainties.

Funds raised by Indian IPOs fell to just $2.8 billion this year, the lowest in four years, according to data from Refinitiv. In 2017, the proceeds hit a record $11.7 billion before falling to $5.5 billion in 2018.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2019 11:40PM ET</span>",Prosecutors claim Avenatti was over $15 million in debt during alleged Nike extortion,"By Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) - California attorney Michael Avenatti, known for representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against U.S. President Donald Trump, was more than $15 million in debt when he allegedly tried to extort as much as $25 million from  Nike  Inc (N:NKE), U.S. prosecutors claimed.
""Specifically, the Government presently estimates that the defendant's debts at that time were, conservatively, in excess of $15 million,"" prosecutors said in a filing late on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York.
In a statement to Reuters late on Wednesday, Avenatti denied those claims and dismissed them as ""bogus"".
""Any claim that I was $15 million in debt is completely bogus, ludicrous and absurd. I can't wait for the trial in this case, at which point the TRUTH and FACTS will come out and I will be fully exonerated,"" Avenatti said in an emailed statement.
Last week, Avenatti, 48, pleaded not guilty to an indictment accusing him of trying to extort up to $25 million from Nike by threatening to go public with claims the company made improper payments to athletes.
The celebrity lawyer is accused by prosecutors of demanding money from the athletic wear company in exchange for agreeing to scrap a threatened news conference to discuss Nike's alleged improper payments to elite college basketball recruits.
A trial is scheduled for late in January. Nike, which has denied wrongdoing, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Wednesday.
Since his March 25 arrest in the Nike case, Avenatti has defended himself against a variety of criminal charges.
He has pleaded not guilty in Manhattan to stealing about $300,000 from Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, after helping her secure a book contract.
He has also pleaded not guilty in California to wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, including stealing from clients."
1111,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2019 06:56PM ET</span>",Record online sales give U.S. holiday shopping season a boost: report,"(Reuters) - U.S. shoppers spent more online during this year's holiday shopping season, a report by Mastercard Inc (N:MA) showed on Wednesday, with e-commerce sales hitting a record high.
The holiday shopping season is a crucial period for retailers and can account for up to 40% of annual sales. But this year, Thanksgiving, which traditionally starts the U.S. holiday shopping period, was on Nov. 28, nearly a week later than last year's Nov. 22, leaving retailers with six fewer days to drive sales between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
E-commerce sales this year made up 14.6% of total retail and rose 18.8% from the 2018 period, according to Mastercard’s data tracking retail sales from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve.
Overall holiday retail sales, excluding autos, rose 3.4%.
""E-commerce sales hit a record high this year with more people doing their holiday shopping online,"" said Steve Sadove, senior adviser for Mastercard.
""Due to a later than usual Thanksgiving holiday, we saw retailers offering omnichannel sales earlier in the season, meeting consumers’ demand for the best deals across all channels and devices,” Sadove said. 
Retailers have invested heavily to provide same-day delivery, lockers for store pick-up and improve their online presence as they battle against retail giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) for market share.
U.S. President Donald Trump, whose support in the polls has been buoyed by strong economic data despite his impeachment by the House of Representatives, heralded the news in a tweet in all capital letters. 
""2019 HOLIDAY RETAIL SALES WERE UP 3.4% FROM LAST YEAR, THE BIGGEST NUMBER IN U.S. HISTORY. CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA!,"" Trump tweeted.
However, Mastercard spokesman William Tsang, citing 2018's 5.1% growth in total sales, said this year's holiday sales growth was not the biggest ever. 
The White House had no immediate comment on the apparent discrepancy.
Despite slowing global growth, U.S. consumer spending is benefiting from wage growth and a strong labor market, retail consultants and analysts say. 
The holiday season was challenging for retailers after Amazon expanded its free return policy to include products that were not previously eligible, giving consumers until January to return even small purchases bought on the website.
The National Retail Federation had forecast U.S. holiday retail sales over the two months to increase between 3.8% and 4.2%. That compares with an average annual increase of 3.7% over the past five years.

The SpendingPulse report tracks spending by combining sales activity in Mastercard's payments network with estimates of cash and other payment forms but excludes automobile sales.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2019 12:31PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Russia's Sberbank to remain Yandex partner, may adjust some projects - CEO Gref","By Tatiana Voronova and Katya Golubkova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Sberbank (MM:SBER) plans to continue its partnership with  Yandex  (O:YNDX) even though it has transferred its 'golden share' in the country's leading internet company to another entity, Sberbank's Chief Executive German Gref told Reuters.
To assuage Kremlin fears about potential foreign influence, Yandex this month approved changes to its corporate structure to establish a ""public interest foundation"" which would receive Sberbank's golden share and a number of other rights.
Sberbank, Russia's top bank, has also agreed to buy a stake in internet company Mail.Ru (L:MAILRq), as Gref continues to transform the lender into a banking-to-online services company.
The Mail.Ru deal and the transfer of the Yandex golden share have raised questions about the future of Sberbank's partnership with Yandex, which includes joint ventures Yandex.Market and Yandex.Money.
""Partnership (with Yandex) will remain,"" Gref told Reuters, adding there could be some changes in a number of the companies' joint projects.
He said Sberbank may consider ending a non-compete agreement with Yandex on banking services, allowing Yandex to request a banking license for Yandex.Money so it can develop payment services.
""There is no threat to Yandex.Money, they are growing, they are developing but to achieve the next high-quality jump we need to decide on its future destiny,"" Gref said.
He added that Sberbank and Yandex had agreed to deepen cooperation in educational projects, without giving further details.
Sberbank, via its stake in Mail.Ru, is an indirect shareholder in AliExpress Russia, a joint venture between China's largest e-commerce firm,  Alibaba  (N:BABA), the Russian Direct Investment Fund, mobile operator Megafon and Mail.Ru.
Gref said he saw no violation of a non-compete agreement which limits Sberbank's development of e-commerce projects to within Yandex.Market, calling the indirect stake in AliExpress Russia ""insignificant"". However, he said that Sberbank plans to discuss with Mail.Ru whether the bank would take a direct role in the AliExpress joint venture.
SHAREHOLDING CHANGE
Two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Wednesday that the government was in talks with the central bank to buy the latter's 50% plus one share stake in Sberbank, potentially using National Wealth Fund cash.
Gref said that Sberbank was not involved in the talks but stood ready to work with the finance ministry if it became its new majority shareholder.
""I do not see any problems here. There could be some issues related to the transition period. As far as I know, there is no final decision taken yet,"" Gref said."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong anti-government protesters marched through Christmas-decorated shopping centers on Wednesday, chanting pro-democracy slogans and forcing one mall to close early, as police fired tear gas to disperse crowds gathering on nearby streets.
The protests have turned more confrontational over the festive season, though earlier in December they had been largely peaceful after pro-democracy candidates overwhelmingly won district council elections.
Despite the embarrassing results, Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leaders have made no new concessions.
""Confrontation is expected, it doesn't matter if it's Christmas,"" said Chan, a 28-year-old restaurant worker who was part of a crowd which exchanged insults with police outside a shopping center in the Mong Kok district.
""I’m disappointed the government still didn’t respond to any of our ... demands. We continue to come out even if we don’t have much hope,"" said Chan, who only gave his surname.
Riot police patrolled several neighborhoods while tourists and shoppers, many wearing Santa hats or reindeer antlers, strolled past. 
There were no major clashes, but with impromptu crowds forming to shout expletives at the unpopular officers, who have been accused of using excessive force, police briefly fired tear gas in Mong Kok, a popular protest area. 
Police describe their reaction to the unrest as restrained.
Hundreds of protesters, dressed in black and wearing face masks, descended on shopping malls around the Chinese-ruled city, shouting popular slogans such as ""Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!""
Police arrested several people in a shopping mall in the Sha Tin district after pepper-spraying them. The mall closed early.
CHRISTMAS 'RUINED'
Baton-wielding police fired tear gas on Tuesday at thousands of protesters who barricaded roads and trashed a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) cafe and an HSBC branch. 
The city's leader Carrie Lam said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Wednesday that many Hong Kongers and tourists were disappointed that their ""Christmas Eve celebrations have been ruined"".
""Such illegal acts have not only dampened the festive mood but also adversely affected local businesses.""
The Hospital Authority said 25 people had been injured overnight, including one man who fell from the second to first floor of a shopping mall as he tried to escape the police.
HSBC has become embroiled in a controversy involving a recent police crackdown on a fund-raising platform supporting protesters. HSBC denied any connection between the crackdown and its closure of an account linked to the group, but remains the target of protester rage.
Starbucks has been targeted after the daughter of the founder of Maxim's Caterers, which owns the local franchise, publicly condemned the protesters.
DINNER WITH STRANGERS
The protests started more than six months ago against a now-withdrawn bill which would have allowed extraditions to mainland China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
They have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement, with demonstrators angry at what they perceive as increased meddling by Beijing in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China denies interfering, saying it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time and blaming foreign forces for fomenting unrest.
While protesters have repeatedly vandalized businesses they believed to have ties with pro-Beijing figures, they deliberately supported those which have offered them shelter from tear gas or free water during hot summer marches.
One eatery in the Tsim Sha Tsui tourist area organized a Christmas dinner for protesters, with hundreds queuing outside for a free plate of noodles or fried chicken.

""It’s my first time going to a buffet with strangers, but we share the same goals ... so it feels like a meaningful way to spend Christmas,"" said private tutor Kenny, 46, who was eating outside the diner.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's finance minister has sought to downplay a row between the government and the construction and engineering arm of South Korean giant Hyundai (KS:000720) over a $740 million suspension bridge, saying disputes in such mega projects were ""quite common.""
Hyundai Engineering and Construction (HDEC) said on Monday it had suspended construction of the bridge, which will connect the Chilean island of Chiloe to the mainland. It accused the government of bad faith for seeking to increase the scope of the project without additional remuneration.
On Tuesday, however, HDEC said in a statement to Reuters that the bridge construction was still under way. Chile´s minister of public works, Alfred Moreno, also said on Tuesday that there was no pause in construction of the bridge.
Finance Minister Ignacio Briones said he was confident the disagreement could be ironed out in talks or in the courts.
""As far as I understand, the government has honored exactly what the contract defines, but the Korean company says the opposite has occurred. ... When there are these discrepancies...it is for the courts - if it gets to that point - to decide,"" he told Chilean daily El Mercurio on Tuesday.
HDEC leads the Consorcio Puente Chacao (CPC) that won the tender for the bridge's construction in December 2013.
The company said on Monday that the government's Department of Public Works (MOP) and its legal advisers said at a meeting in December that it would not increase the value of the project.
""The breach of the commitments made by the MOP, the bad faith with which the conversations have been carried out, the unjust damage that results from this and the complete legal uncertainty that prevails as a consequence, has led CPC to conclude that it is impossible, in these conditions, to continue with the project,"" HDEC said on Monday.
It said it regretted the effect on the workers and the inhabitants of Chiloé, as well as the failure of what it called the most important connectivity project in Chilean history.
The 2.5-km-long (1.5 miles) link to Chiloe, an island roughly the size of Corsica, would be Latin America’s longest suspension bridge.
The bridge was first proposed in 1972, but the project has been canceled and postponed several times. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-landrights-island/mystical-islanders-divided-over-chiles-giant-bridge-project-idUSKCN1GD5JE
The MOP said in its statement on Monday that HDEC had sought to increase the cost of the project by 50%, or $300 million, a request rejected both by the current government of President Sebastian Pinera and the former government of Michelle Bachelet.
Moreno, the minister of public works said Chile would not accept any delay in construction of the bridge.
""The contract included design, engineering and construction,"" he said in a statement to Chilean media in Santiago on Tuesday. ""In other words, all the responsibility and risk lies with the contractor.""
A spokesman for HDEC said, “We have been negotiating the cost of the project with our partners in Chile,” a spokesman said."
1119,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>",Heads of three Japan Post firms to resign over improper policy sales: media,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The heads of Japan Post Holdings Co (T:6178) and affiliates Japan Post Insurance Co (T:7181) and Japan Post will resign this week over the improper sales of insurance policies, broadcaster TBS reported on Wednesday.
A committee of external lawyers investigating the misconduct said last week the number of cases in which Japan Post Insurance improperly sold policies had reached 12,836, of which 670 involved violations of the law or internal rules.
That was more than double the 6,327 cases disclosed in September in an interim report submitted by the committee, while more cases could be found as it continues its probe. 
The committee said last week it had investigated about 82% of the 183,000 policies sold over the five years through fiscal 2018 that may have been disadvantageous to customers.
Revelations of the misconduct have pushed corporate governance to the fore just as the government had been planning to sell $10 billion worth of shares in parent Japan Post Holdings to fund reconstruction in areas devastated by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. 
Japan Post Holdings Chief Executive Masatsugu Nagato, Japan Post Insurance President Mitsuhiko Uehira and Japan Post President Kunio Yokoyama will step down on Friday when the country's financial regulator would issue administrative punishments to the companies, TBS said. 
The three companies declined to comment.
Nagato told a press conference last week he would announce his management responsibility at an ""appropriate time"" when asked about resignation.

Nagato may be replaced by Hiroya Masuda, a former minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, according to TBS.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co documents under review by a U.S. congressional panel appear to point to a ""very disturbing"" picture of commentary from the planemaker's employees over the grounded 737 MAX aircraft, a congressional aide said on Tuesday. 
The documents were submitted to the House of Representatives transportation infrastructure committee and the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday, the same day Boeing announced the firing of chief executive Dennis Muilenburg amid a crisis over the handling of the aftermath of two fatal crashes.
The best-selling 737 MAX has been grounded since March. The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia within five months killed 346 people.
""Similar to other records previously disclosed by Boeing, the records appear to point to a very disturbing picture of both concerns expressed by Boeing employees about the company’s commitment to safety and efforts by some employees"" to make sure Boeing’s production plans were not disrupted, said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Boeing said in a statement that it ""proactively brought these communications to the FAA and Congress as part of our commitment to transparency with our regulators and the oversight committees.""
The tone and content ""does not reflect the company we are and need to be,"" Boeing said.
""We have made significant changes as a company in the past nine months to enhance our safety processes, organizations, and culture.""
The company said on Monday that Boeing board chairman David Calhoun, 62, a former  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) executive who has been on the board since 2009 would take over from Muilenburg as CEO and president from Jan. 13.
The latest batch of documents submitted to the FAA contained instant messages from a former Boeing senior pilot, Mark Forkner, according to a person briefed on the matter.
In October, Boeing turned over 2016 messages to the FAA between Forkner and another pilot that said he might have unintentionally misled the U.S. regulator and raised questions about the performance of a key safety system during testing.
Boeing had earlier turned over the documents to the Justice Department, which has an active criminal investigation underway into matters related to the 737 MAX plane.
Boeing is struggling to mend relations with U.S. and international regulators it needs to win over to get the jet back in the air.

Boeing shares, which have dropped more than 20% over the past nine months, closed down 1.3% to $333 on Tuesday.

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 05:16PM ET</span>",Nissan top executive Seki to resign in blow to turnaround plan,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - The executive tasked with leading a recovery at Nissan Motor Co Ltd said he had decided to resign just weeks into his new job, a move that could disrupt the automaker's push to turn the corner on scandal and slumping sales.
Jun Seki, Nissan's vice chief operating officer and a former contender for chief executive, told Reuters he was leaving to become the president of Nidec Corp, a Kyoto-based manufacturer of automotive components and precision motors.
He will likely depart in January after three decades at Nissan, including a stint heading its China business.
""I love Nissan and I feel bad about leaving the turnaround work unfinished, but I am 58 years old, and this is an offer I could not refuse. It's probably my last chance to lead a company too,"" he said in a brief interview. 
""It's not about money. In fact, I will take a financial hit since Nissan pays us well,"" Seki said. He declined to elaborate further.
Nissan and Nidec declined to comment. 
Seeking to roll back some of the costly expansion under ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn, Nissan has embarked on wide-ranging turnaround plan. 
That plan, which began in April, is now on track to generate a cumulative few hundred billion yen in cost cuts and operational efficiency gains by the year to March 2022, according to two Nissan sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. One hundred billion yen is roughly equal to $915 million.
Adding to concerns about disruption among Nissan's top management, the sources said that Seki, Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta and Chief Executive Makoto Uchida have so far failed to gel as a team after being named to their posts in October.
They officially took over on Dec. 1.
""There was no instant, cohesive chemistry achieved by those appointments,"" one of the sources said. 
Gupta and Uchida were not immediately available for comment.
Seki's resignation could further complicate Nissan's relationship with top shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). Seki recently worked in Paris for a year and was seen as relatively close to the French automaker.
PERSUADED IN THE END
Asked if he was leaving Nissan because he was passed over for the role of chief executive, Seki said that was not the case but did not elaborate.
He and Uchida, most recently the head of the China business, had been seen as top contenders for the CEO job. Reuters reported in September that Uchida was seen as more favored by Renault.
Before being named vice-COO, Seki was a senior vice-president charged with leading the turnaround.
Nissan has been profoundly shaken over the last year, first with the downfall of long-term leader Ghosn, who is now awaiting trial on allegations of financial misconduct that he has denied. Former Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa then left in September.
One of the sources said Seki was contacted by a headhunter about a job at Nidec in April, after he returned from a year working in Paris.
Nidec's 75-year-old chairman, the brash and confident Shigenobu Nagamori, has been searching for an eventual successor to lead and expand its business.
Nidec, which sees electric vehicles as a key driver of growth, has a 40% global market share in automotive electric steering motors and has said it wants to boost its share in electric vehicle propulsion motors.
After April, Seki had no additional contact with Nidec until the recruiter called him again on Oct. 8 when Nissan announced the new management team, including Uchida as CEO.
After that second call, Seki agreed to meet Nagamori - to turn down the offer, the source said.

""Nagamori talked Seki into accepting his offer in the end,"" the source said.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 03:07PM ET</span>",New Boeing CEO Calhoun is hardened corporate crisis manager,"By Allison Lampert, Kenneth Li and Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - Beleaguered  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is putting its future in the hands of a turnaround veteran who has led several companies in crisis, cut his teeth at engine maker  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and has spent a decade on the board of the world's largest planemaker.
Newly appointed Chief Executive David Calhoun, 62, was made Boeing's chairman two months ago in the midst of the crisis that has rocked the company since airliner disasters in Indonesia and Ethiopia led to the grounding of its best-selling 737 MAX. 
This isn't his first taste of corporate upheaval.
Calhoun became chairman of the  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) board shortly after federal agents raided its headquarters in 2017, headed a General Electric unit that included jet engines after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, and turned round media research company Nielsen to go public. He has also been a longtime executive at Blackstone (NYSE:BX) private equity group.
""Having seen him run GE's aviation business after 9/11, I know he can execute under pressure,” former GE chief executive Jeff Immelt told Reuters by email when asked about Calhoun, adding that Calhoun would restore customer trust in Boeing.
As Calhoun tackles the MAX crisis, he also faces questions from European regulators over a deal to buy the commercial arm of Brazil's Embraer in a major strategic move.
Calhoun, who has co-written a book on business, ""How Companies Win,"" says being candid is part of being a leader, an approach which many critics say was absent from Boeing’s initially guarded approach to concerns about the 737 MAX.
“The second you get into the office til the second you leave, every interaction is judged,” he said in a video published in 2014 by the Jack Welch Management Institute. 
“You try to hide anything from everybody and I think your body language becomes perfectly apparent.”
Yet in his short time as Boeing chairman, Calhoun has showed his ability to force changes behind the scenes, as seen by his role in the departure of Kevin McAllister as chief executive of Boeing's planemaking arm in October. The removal was silent and swift, foreshadowing Dennis Muilenburg's ouster this week.
Some insiders saw McAllister - another GE veteran - as a scapegoat for the MAX crisis. Others say he paid the price for distractions including widely publicized cracks in the company's older 737NG jets, which caught the board off guard. The 737 MAX was not impacted by the cracking issue.
The reckoning came at an informal board dinner in Texas led by Calhoun in late October. As directors wound up a two-day summit a day later, Calhoun and Muilenburg took McAllister aside and told him he was out, two people briefed on the meeting said.
In a sign that the board was already claiming a new voice under recently appointed chairman Calhoun, having split the CEO and chairman roles, the decisive dinner conversation that led to the shake-up took place without Muilenburg, the people said.
Boeing declined comment on confidential board discussions.
McAllister and Muilenburg could not be reached.
PRESSURE FOR CHANGE
Now, Calhoun must repair frayed relations with regulators, continue to manage a cash squeeze from the crisis and bring to market the new 777X jet at a time of tough regulatory scrutiny.
His experience on the Boeing board will allow Calhoun to ""take the reins in short order without the need for a longer period of familiarization,"" said Timm Schulze-Melander, industrials specialist at European research house Redburn.
As a long-time board member who learned the industry at GE, Calhoun shares the qualities of both an insider and outsider - worrying some who question whether he is the fresh blood Boeing needs to overhaul what often seems a smug corporate culture.
""Boeing needs a revamp of its corporate governance. The board should be fired,” said Paul Njoroge, a Toronto-based investment professional who lost his family in the Ethiopia crash. 
“I don't think (Calhoun) is going to change the culture of Boeing,"" he added.
A former Nielsen executive called Calhoun a ""hard-nosed"" leader who does not warm to dissent, but who can inspire.
“(Boeing) might need someone as tough as Dave. I don't think he would be a good manager over a long period of time. As a crisis manager, he might be able to get it done,” the person said.
Even though Calhoun sat on Boeing's board throughout the development of the MAX, some argue he has the tenacity to drive through reform.
""It is hard to bring in somebody who doesn't know aviation or have credibility with airlines,"" said Lundquist Group managing director Jerrold Lundquist, a consultant who first met Calhoun in the 1990s and who believes he is what stricken Boeing needs.

""It is tough to come in cold. To some degree that is a trade-off they have to make,"" Lundquist said.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 01:48PM ET</span>",Brash Uber co-founder Kalanick leaves board to focus on industrial kitchens,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Travis Kalanick, the pugnacious co-founder of Uber (NYSE:UBER), has severed his last ties with the ride-services company, resigning from the board and selling all his shares as he turns his focus to a new venture creating ""ghost kitchens"" for food delivery services. 
Kalanick, who helped found Uber in 2009 and once exerted nearly complete control, stepped down as chief executive in June 2017 under pressure from investors after a string of setbacks.
He will depart Uber's board of directors by the end of the year, the company said on Tuesday.
A spokeswoman on Tuesday said Kalanick has sold his entire stake of roughly $3 billion worth of shares in Uber, adding that the final regulatory form will be filed on Thursday after Christmas. Axios earlier reported the sale of final shares.
The spokeswoman declined to disclose what Kalanick would do with the proceeds.
Kalanick's bellicose style turned Uber into the world's largest ride-services company, revolutionized the taxi industry and challenged transportation regulations worldwide.
""Very few entrepreneurs have built something as profound as Travis Kalanick did with Uber,"" Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement, crediting Kalanick's ""vision and tenacity.""
But his brashness was also blamed for a string of scandals and complaints over his leadership, resulting in a shareholder revolt to push him out.
Kalanick said in a statement that now Uber was a public company, he wanted to focus on his current business and philanthropic pursuits. He is currently working on a startup that aims to build large industrial kitchens and lease space to restaurants. The ""ghost kitchens"" would prepare meals for food delivery without the costs of wait staff and real estate of locations that serve diners.
The company, known as ""CloudKitchens,"" to date has collected $400 million in investor funding by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, according to Crunchbase. Kalanick himself invested ""several hundred million"" in the business, his spokeswoman said, declining to provide the full amount. 
Uber stock has dropped more than 30% since the loss-making company went public in May as investors grow skeptical over the ride-hailing company's business model and its ability to turn a profit. Uber shares on Tuesday closed largely unchanged at $30.44.
Analysts at Wedbush on Tuesday welcomed the news of Kalanick's departure, saying his remaining on the board would have been a distraction.
""Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror,"" Wedbush analysts Ygal Arounian and Daniel Ives said in a note.
When Kalanick resigned in the summer of 2017, the company had been through a bruising six months during which employees accused the former CEO of fostering a toxic work culture that encouraged sexual harassment and bullying. 
Kalanick in a statement at the time said Uber was seeking to be a workplace for everyone with no tolerance for sexual harassment and bullying, and vowed to fire all employees who engaged in such behavior.

Kalanick gave up voting control of the company in October 2017 when Uber's board of directors adopted a series of measures to shore up corporate governance, including a one vote per share policy.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 01:35PM ET</span>","S&P 500, Dow pause near records in Christmas Eve trade","By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow industrials slipped in a shortened, pre-Christmas session on Tuesday, as investors paused after a record-setting rally fueled by improving U.S.-China trade relations that has put the market on course for its best year since 2013.
The Nasdaq eked out a gain, helped by a rise in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc shares, to register an all-time high close for a ninth straight session. All three major indexes posted record closes on Monday.
The benchmark S&P 500 index is set for its biggest annual percentage gain since 2013, with the market's mood a sharp contrast with Christmas Eve a year ago, which was the tail end of a severe swoon in which the S&P 500 came within a hair of confirming a bear market.
“It’s a quiet market after a week of gains,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. “Compared with last year at the same time, it’s a major relief as we go into the period of much lower volume.”
Dec. 24, 2018, turned out to be a recent closing low for the S&P 500, with U.S. stocks beginning a rally that would carry through into 2019. The benchmark S&P 500 is up over 28% so far this year, fueled by optimism over improving U.S.-China trade relations, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and better than feared economic data and corporate profits.
“After this strong run, day after day of the market gaining, it stands to reason that ... you’re going to see the market flat or even some profit taking,” Krosby said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.08 points, or 0.13%, to 28,515.45, the S&P 500 lost 0.63 point, or 0.02%, to 3,223.38 and the Nasdaq Composite added 7.24 points, or 0.08%, to 8,952.88.
Industrials lagged the most among S&P 500 sectors, while real estate was the top gainer.
Volumes are expected to be thin this week as traders settle in for the holidays. The main U.S. stock exchanges closed at 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday and remain shut on Wednesday.
Only roughly 2.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges on Tuesday, compared with the nearly 7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.
In company news, shares of chip company AMD rose 2.4% after RBC raised its price target.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc shares rose 0.4% after co-founder Travis Kalanick severed his last ties with the ride-services company.

DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - Tim Clark will retire as the president of Emirates Airline [EMIRA.UL] at the end of June 2020 after more than three decades at the state-controlled business that has helped to transform Dubai into one of the world's major travel crossroads. 
Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum said on Tuesday in an internal memo to staff, reviewed by Reuters, that Clark would stay on as an adviser to the company.
""Through wars, economic recessions, disasters natural or manmade, and various industry upheavals, Tim has ably steered and grown Emirates to its standing today as the world's largest international airline, and an eminent player in the global airline industry,"" Sheikh Ahmed said in the memo. 
An Emirates spokeswoman confirmed the retirement to Reuters.
Clark, 70, joined the airline as a founding member in 1985, having previously worked at Gulf Air and Caledonian Airways.
The British national became Emirates' president in 2003.
""Tim is a giant of the industry. He had the vision behind Emirates and has cultivated the airline to where it is today,"" said independent aviation consultant John Strickland.
Knighted in 2014 for his services to British prosperity and the aviation industry, Clark has since been referred to by many in the industry, including those at Emirates, as ""Sir Tim"".
Sheikh Ahmed, a member of Dubai's ruling family who has been the airline's chairman since inception, praised Clark as being central to Emirates success and Dubai's emergence as a global aviation hub.
""His achievements are too many to recount individually, but they will all be remembered,"" he said in the memo.
Emirates, profitable for the past 31 years, has been crucial to putting Dubai on the map and its transformation into a global financial and tourism hub. 
Launched in 1985 with aircraft leased from Pakistan International Airlines, Emirates today operates a fleet of 270 aircraft to 159 destinations, according to its website.
It carried close to 60 million passengers in its last financial year, and operates the single largest fleet of Airbus A380 superjumbo jets.
The airline has in recent years faced a slowdown in growth. 
In a separate email to staff this month, it said that from next year it would no longer offer discounted tickets to friends of employees, citing the impact those reduced fares have had on revenue.
Emirates' hub, Dubai International Airport, has been the world's busiest for international passengers since 2014 when it overtook London's Heathrow airport.

Clark departs as the major airline sets upon a new growth strategy as it retires older A380 jets and starts receiving smaller Airbus A350s and Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s ordered this year.

1128,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 09:34AM ET</span>",Repo Oracle Claims Victory Even If Fed Skips QE,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Imagine you are a longtime Wall Street denizen, accustomed to analyzing trends in the public equity markets, sovereign interest rates, foreign exchange and corporate credit. You think you have a good handle on all these large asset classes.
But suddenly, the plumbing of the entire financial system goes haywire in mid-September, and no one knows why. You are fielding questions about the overnight repurchase agreement market and whether this is another banking crisis in the making. Scouring previous research, you see that one analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) AG was warning about a potential repo squeeze before this episode happened. His name: Zoltan Pozsar.
It almost has a mystical aura — Zoltan is derived from “sultan”; it may or may not be the name of a grand prince of the Hungarians; and there’s even a Zoltan fortune-teller toy. As Bloomberg Businessweek noted in a profile last week, in which Pozsar was dubbed a “repo oracle,” he worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York starting in 2008 and was known for creating a map of the financial system that included repo and “shadow” banks outside of traditional lending. If anyone had the bonafides to diagnose what ails the short-term funding markets, it certainly seems as if it would be him.
Those past credentials are part of what made Pozsar’s Dec. 9 report on the repo market all the more alarming. Titled “Countdown to QE4?” it emphasized from the opening paragraph that “reserves are still insufficient; there are no true ‘excess’ reserves; and large U.S. banks’ G-SIB scores are shaping up to be a severe binding constraint heading into the year-end turn.” 
“The Fed has been slow to recognize the full implications of this situation,” he continued. “The day we run out of reserves would be the day when the world would stop spinning. No, this is not an overstatement.” Pozsar concluded that U.S. Treasury yields could spike around the end of the year and that the Fed would have to shift from buying only short-term bills to purchasing longer-dated government debt — another round of quantitative easing in no uncertain terms.
Predictably, these comments rocked Wall Street, especially among those who traffic in financial doomsday scenarios. The report was seemingly so widely read that a reporter asked Fed Chair Jerome Powell at his Dec. 11 press conference what extra steps the central bank would take to address year-end funding pressures in FX swaps and repo markets. Perhaps understanding the origin of the question, Powell said the central bank was willing to purchase longer-dated Treasuries if necessary.
Now, just a week away from the turn of the calendar, there are signs that the market will avoid the worst-case scenario — something Pozsar had said “we are on track to realize.” Most notably, primary dealers submitted just $31.3 billion in bids for the Fed’s 14-day term repo operation on Dec. 19 and then $28.8 billion in bids for a 15-day term operation on Dec. 23, both less than the $35 billion on offer. By contrast, the first four term offerings for year-end were oversubscribed. It appears that the central bank’s plan to offer almost half a trillion dollars through repo operations for year-end is easing any lingering anxiety over another funding squeeze.
Few strategists are willing to sound the all clear just yet, given the unexpected tumult just a few months ago. It still looks as if repo rates will lurch higher on Dec. 31, but perhaps not to an unmanageable degree.
Suffice to say, few if any are particularly thrilled with the way the Fed has handled the repo market in recent months. As I wrote last month, it seemed as if central bankers were simply throwing the kitchen sink at funding markets and hoping it would be enough to calm them down. Maybe it’s just coincidence, but just days after Pozsar’s note sounded the alarm about year-end, the Fed pledged an additional $365 billion of term repo operations to provide funding through January. 
Pozsar, in the Businessweek profile, seemed to walk back his call for QE4 and claim victory even if his dire prediction doesn’t come to pass. “If the year-end is less of a problem because of the repo bazooka we got from the Fed, and if the message of my report played a part in getting that bazooka, then that’s a nice way to be proven wrong,” he said. But he still sees something ominous on the horizon for the repo market: “I think the system will get gummed up again.” 
For the Fed, getting past year-end would be enough of a victory. The structural issues that Pozsar flags, like incentives within global systemically important banks to cut back on market-making in the FX swap and repo markets, can’t be addressed so quickly — or, at least, not in a way that’s palatable to central bank officials. Policy makers are advocating for a standing repo facility to alleviate any funding strains, with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan each saying in recent weeks that they want to see that come together next year.
Getting into the New Year without a massive disruption would be a victory for all of Wall Street. As I wrote during the September chaos, repo is not something that every investor needs to understand in-depth. They just need to have confidence that it’ll function smoothly day in and day out. It’s why Pozsar hit such a nerve when he wrote that running out of bank reserves would stop the world from spinning. Not to jinx it, but it looks as if the sun will rise come 2020."
1129,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 09:19AM ET</span>",New Boeing boss faces EU pressure over Embraer tie-up: sources,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - As Boeing's (N:BA) new boss tackles the immediate crisis over its grounded 737 MAX jet, he also faces pressing questions from European regulators over a deal to buy the commercial arm of Brazil's Embraer - seen as key to its longer-term strategy.
European Union regulators investigating the $4.2 billion tie-up have asked for more than 1.5 million pages of information and data on over 20 years of sales campaigns, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The volume of requests highlights the European Commission's concerns over a deal it suspects would reduce the number of major participants in the global jet market from three to two, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Any delay or derailing of the transaction would be a further setback for Boeing, which on Monday named David Calhoun as its new CEO amid a crisis over the grounding of its top-selling 737 MAX following two fatal crashes.
Calhoun knows Embraer from his former senior role at engine maker  General Electric  (N:GE) and is expected to push hard for the tie-up, one industry source said. 
Boeing has agreed to buy 80% of Embraer's (SA:EMBR3) commercial jets division which competes with Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) in the market for planes below 150 seats. 
Airbus had earlier bought the main competitor to Embraer's 80-120-seat E2 jet family from Canada's Bombardier and is racking up sales of the renamed A220 while its U.S. rival's takeover of Embraer makes slow progress.
Originally set for 2019, the Boeing-Embraer deal was delayed after the Commission decided in October to deepen a competition probe, now scheduled to end in late February.
The sources said the Commission had requested the extra data on top of the hundreds of thousands of pieces of information shared by other regulators, and that it was examining data on over 1,000 actual or potential sales campaigns over two decades.
U.S. sources deny the deal would reduce the market from three to two players, saying the mainline and regional markets are separate, even though Airbus has a foot in both camps.
Lawyers on all sides are now waiting to see whether the Commission launches a ""statement of objections,"" a step that can lead to a request for concessions to secure approval. 
The Commission and companies all declined to comment.
The United States, Japan and China have approved the deal and Brazil is expected to confirm preliminary backing soon.
EUROPEAN BATTLES
Airbus and Boeing share the market for jets above 150 seats and their deals with Bombardier and Embraer respectively are extending their rivalry into smaller, regional jets. 
Beyond the battle between the E2 and the A220, broader issues are at stake as the two companies lay the foundation for longer-term contests against China. https://reut.rs/372Zata
Boeing is interested in Embraer's lower-cost engineering, industrial footprint and technology such as landing gear. That means Embraer is likely to play a key role in developing the portfolio that eventually replaces jets including the MAX. 
The probe also intensifies a noisy European battleground for Boeing as it faces questions from Europe's safety agency over the MAX and the likelihood in 2020 of EU counter-tariffs after Washington taxed Airbus jets in a subsidy dispute.
European officials deny any link between competition and trade dossiers, but EU experts say the simultaneous challenges reflect Europe's growing international muscle as its regulators speak with a louder voice on multiple fronts.
Without linking the Embraer case to the subsidy dispute, Airbus is anxious to ensure a level U.S. playing field for the A220, which has already been targeted with separate U.S. tariffs that were later overturned, one European trade source said.
Airbus has held several contacts with officials probing the deal and incoming CEO Guillaume Faury met the EU's Competition Commissioner in March, people familiar with the talks said.
A U.S. industry source said top-level contacts early in the process are unusual and Brazilian reports say Airbus has argued against the deal. An Airbus spokesman said any claims that it was lobbying the EU against the deal were ""without substance"". 
U.S. and Brazilian sources say Airbus is using its market power to offer attractive deals for the A220 packaged with other jets, and can only benefit from further delays in the Boeing-Embraer link-up.

European sources say the A220's success reflects a newer design and reduced uncertainty over its future under Airbus. They deny Airbus is winning by cross-selling with larger jets.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>",Italy pushes on with plans to reform motorway concession rules,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Francesca Landini
ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government is pressing ahead with measures to make it easier and less costly to revoke concessions to operate motorways, even though one party in the ruling coalition opposes this, top officials said on Tuesday.
The measures would potentially open the way for the government to end the concession held by  Atlantia  (MI:ATL), whose subsidiary Autostrade per l'Italia (ASPI) was the operator of a bridge that collapsed in Genoa last year, killing 43 people.
Atlantia, which is controlled by the Benetton family, has always denied wrongdoing over the Genoa disaster and said it spent more on maintenance of the motorway network than required by its contract.
At the end of a late night meeting on Monday, the ruling coalition signed off on a rule that considerably reduces the amount the government must pay to a toll road company if a concession is revoked due to shortcomings on the part of the operator.
The rule, which is part of a broader decree, also states that state-owned road company ANAS will temporarily manage the motorways if an operator has its concession revoked.
In an interview with daily Il Messaggero on Tuesday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the new rule eliminates an unfair advantage for Atlantia, adding that a decision on the revocation of the concession would be taken in January.
""There is no alarm for the concessions sector: those who have made investments, even in the event of contract breach, will be able to recover the amounts for the costs incurred,"" Conte said.
""However, it will no longer be possible to apply favorable rules such as those invoked by Atlantia, which even in the event of a serious breach would involve a compensation of tens of billions (of euros)... I will not allow it.""
The ruling 5-Star Movement has repeatedly called for the company to be stripped of its concession. More than 70 former and current employees of Atlantia and its subsidiaries are under investigation in relation to the Genoa disaster.
Within the coalition, the center-left Democratic Party (PD)also backs the new rule, but the small centrist Italia Viva party, led by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, continues to oppose it, saying it would scare away foreign investors.
Italia Viva's votes are needed to maintain the government's parliamentary majority, so it remains to be seen whether the rule will be passed when the decree is due to be approved in both houses early next year.
The coalition is also divided over whether to end Atlantia's contract outright.
A PD minister, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the decree was intended to force Autostrade to accept a revision of the concession, which expires in 2038.
Proceeds from the concession account for around one third of Atlantia's core profits and guarantee several billions of debt issued by ASPI.
A source close to ASPI warned the company would go bankrupt if the government revoked its concession without compensation.
ASPI said in a statement on Sunday the new rule risked being in breach of the Italian constitution if it results in unilaterally revoking a contract by one of the parties involved. The company said it might take legal steps to protect itself and warned it could seek multi-billion-euro compensation from the state.

1133,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 06:38AM ET</span>","HNA Group Is Said To Repay Yuan Bond, Avoiding Default","(Bloomberg) -- Troubled Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co. repaid a 1.3 billion yuan ($185 million) bond due Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter, avoiding what could have been its first default on a publicly issued note.
HNA’s move is the latest of a series of developments that have helped calm frayed nerves in China’s debt markets in recent days. Peking University Founder Group secured an extension on a local bond repayment deadline and luxury clothing giant Shandong Ruyi Technology Group Co. also repaid a dollar note.
An investor briefed by HNA’s bond trustee said the company has wired the funds to the clearing house, while another bondholder said it received the full payment. Both declined to be identified as they’re not authorized to speak publicly. Calls to HNA’s office responsible for information disclosure went unanswered.
Once a front-runner in China’s debt-fueled global spending spree, HNA said earlier this month that it would halt trading of the yuan bond from Dec. 6 till its maturity due to an unspecified “major event that has yet to be finalized”. It didn’t give any details. The suspended bond last traded at 97.55 yuan on Dec. 5.
HNA has periodically been in the news in recent years for missing payments, selling assets and struggling with debts that climbed to as high as 598.2 billion yuan.
Haikou Meilan International Airport, a major airport backed by HNA units on the southern Hainan island, has defaulted on two private onshore notes totaling 3 billion yuan and a $200 million dollar-denominated bond, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
While HNA itself failed to make good on a 1.5 billion yuan privately issued note in July, the conglomerate has yet to miss a repayment on a public bond, according to Bloomberg calculations.
“The main concern is a lack of liquidity and the complex structure of the group that makes moving money within the organization difficult,” said Warut Promboon, managing partner at credit research firm Bondcritic Ltd. “However, we believe HNA has sufficient credit facilities to pay back bondholders should its creditors allow them to do so,” he said.
A bond due in 2021 from HNA’s unit Hainan Airlines Holding Co. was up by 0.82 yuan to 89.45 yuan on Tuesday. Traders have been closely monitoring this bond as a gauge of broader sentiment about the conglomerate since HNA’s local note was suspended.
HNA shot to prominence between 2016 and 2017 after splurging more than $40 billion on acquisitions across six continents. The once little-known airline operator became the biggest shareholder of iconic companies such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) as well as paying top dollar for high-end properties from Manhattan to Hong Kong.
The company and other equally acquisitive private firms have since come under pressure from Beijing to sell off assets due to concerns that their borrowing sprees could worsen the nation’s debt burden and destabilize its financial system.
Offering a tentative respite to the conglomerate, Haikou Meilan International Airport said it will delay interest payment of 97.5 million yuan due Dec. 29 on its 1.5 billion yuan bond. The decision is to ensure funding for an airport expansion project, it said in a statement dated Dec. 23 on Chinamoney.com.cn.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that cooperation was crucial in the face of regional security threats as the two began their 45-minute meeting on the sidelines of a trilateral summit hosted by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Chengdu. Abe agreed, and said he also hoped to improve the relationship.
“In the current difficult security situation in East Asia, relations between Japan and South Korea are extremely important. South Korea is an important neighbor,” Abe told reporters after the meeting.
Disputes rooted in disagreement over whether Japan has shown sufficient contrition for its history have hurt trade and hindered cooperation between the two U.S. allies on dealing with North Korea. The leaders’ meeting came after Pyongyang signaled it may fire a long-range missile as nuclear talks with the Trump administration stall ahead of a year-end deadline for progress set by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
No breakthroughs were made and the two aired grievances but Abe and Moon indicated they wouldn’t let their relations spin out of control. Their simmering feud has raised concerns about whether their fight would hurt global supply chains and if they could cooperate with Washington as it seeks to put a check on China’s military expansion in the region and curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.
Japan and South Korea “are geographically, historically and culturally the closest neighbors as well as the most important, mutually beneficial partners in terms of human exchanges,” Moon told Abe. “Our relationship is one that cannot be made distant, even if there is temporarily an uncomfortable issue.”
Moon went on to urge Japan to reverse the tighter trade controls it had placed on South Korea, his spokeswoman Ko Min-jung said after the meeting. Abe said trade officials would discuss the issue. For his part, Abe called on Seoul to resolve a disagreement over South Korean court rulings holding Japanese companies liable for cases of forced labor during the 1910-1945 colonization.
The talks had been seen as a positive step that could make it easier for the two nations to bridge differences on simmering disputes that include Japan’s export curbs on goods vital to South Korea’s massive technology sector, part of which was eased last week.
The standoff has damaged trade and tourism ties, with the number of South Koreans visiting Japan in November falling by almost two thirds on the previous year, while Japan’s beer exports to its neighbor collapsed to virtually zero in October.
Under pressure from the U.S., however, South Korea last month suspended its plan to withdraw from a military information-sharing pact with Japan. Since then, there have been hints of a potential thaw in ties.
After the two countries’ trade officials met last week, Japan was reported to have relaxed some of the stricter export controls it had placed on goods sold to South Korea.
South Korea’s presidential office, however, said in a statement the measures did not resolve the problem, while Japan’s top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said Monday the changes in procedures didn’t amount to a relaxation of controls.
While an improvement in relations could benefit both countries, public opinion poses a barrier to compromise. The two leaders have lost support recently, and Moon faces parliamentary elections in April.
An opinion poll published this week by Japan’s Nikkei newspaper found 70% of respondents said there was no need to hurry to improve ties with South Korea. A poll by Seoul-based Realmeter published in late November showed South Korean participation in a boycott of Japanese goods had increased to 72% from 66% two months earlier."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks flatlined near record highs on Tuesday and remained on track for their best year in a decade, as China's latest policy easing pledges added to the optimism generated by signs of detente in the 17-month long Sino-U.S. trade war.
Blue-chip shares in China (CSI300) rose 0.7% after Premier Li Keqiang said the government was considering more measures to lower corporate financing costs and hinted at ""targeted"" cuts in banks' reserve requirement ratio.
Beijing also on Monday announced plans to remove import tarriffs on a range of goods next year.
However, lingering trade concerns and the recent run of gains kept most bourses under pressure, with Korean shares weakening 0.7%, pressured by Monday's data that showed exports in the first 20 days of the month had fallen again.
MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was likewise flat while its all-country benchmark was unchanged, having added 3% this month and 24% since the start of 2019.

A pan-European equity index (STOXX) also hovered near record highs though many continental markets were closed for Christmas and others saw thin trading volumes (STOXX).
""It's been a strong run up to Christmas for stock markets and it seems traders are taking a little breather in this shortened trading week,"" said Craig Erlam, an analyst at online broker.
""It's been a good few weeks for investors, spurred primarily by the de-escalation in the trade war, with Trump only this weekend claiming it will be signed very shortly.""
He was referring to comments by President Donald Trump on Saturday, which spurred Wall Street to new all-time highs on Monday. The S&P 500 hit its eighth straight intraday record (SPX).
New York was also lifted by a 3% surge in Boeing (NYSE:BA) which sacked CEO Dennis Muilenberg over the crisis surrounding its 737 MAX jetliner that followed two fatal crashes.
Equity futures hinted at a flat to firmer open for Wall Street.
STELLAR YEAR BUT WHAT NEXT
World markets are heading into the end of a stellar year, with most major asset classes, from emerging market bonds to U.S. tech shares, enjoying robust returns.
(Graphic: Global markets in 2019 click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/103/103/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
But uncertainty remains on how long the trade truce will last as Trump kicks off his re-election campaign next year.
Worries have also resurfaced about how Britain will navigate the transition period for its exit from the European Union. Those concerns pushed sterling to a near four-week low versus the euro and a three-week trough against the dollar .
The pound was flat at $1.2927 versus highs above $1.35 after the Dec. 12 general election. Against the euro it was at 85.720 pence, coming off the Dec. 13 highs of 82.780 pence.
""Risks to the outlook receded this year, which supported financial markets, but we cannot say the same thing about next year,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities in Tokyo.
Euro zone bond markets were shut but 10-year U.S. Treasury yields slipped one basis point to 1.926% after Monday's slight rise following lackluster demand for two-year bills at auction. Another bond auction is due on Tuesday.
However, yields have risen more than 20 basis points off the 1.69% levels of early December, lifted by the equity rally and signs the U.S. Federal Reserve has paused its rate-cutting cycle.
In Japan, two-year bond yields hit 16-month highs after the message from the minutes of the Bank of Japan's meeting prompted money markets to erase rate cut expectations.
Brent oil futures ticked up 0.2% after Russia's energy minister said cooperation with OPEC to support prices would continue. U.S. crude inventory data, due on Tuesday, is also forecast to show a second straight weekly decline."
1136,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 06:01AM ET</span>",Tokyo should set Y10 billion market cap criteria for proposed prime market: panel,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - A proposed overhaul of the Tokyo Stock Exchange could set a minimum market capitalization requirement of 10 billion yen ($91 million) in free-floating stock for the bourse's ""prime market"", according to a draft proposal released on Tuesday.
Liquidity and governance, not just market capitalization, should be important for listing on the ""prime market"", the proposal from a panel of the regulatory Financial Services Agency (FSA) showed.
The criteria is likely to disappoint investors, many of whom think the exchange should set much tougher conditions in terms of market capitalization and governance in order to limit its main board to strong firms.
""I thought they would aim for a criteria a one digit higher. It seems the plan was watered down a lot,"" said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments.
The 10 billion yen criteria is effectively little different from the current criteria for the main board, which requires companies to be valued at least 25 billion yen, with at least 35% of shares freely traded, at time of listing.
The TSE's first section currently lists 2,159 companies, including some perceived by investors as 'zombie' firms. Trading in many small cap shares is illiquid.
But many investors still hold them because they are listed on the main board and included in the Topix index (TOPX). Apart from the main board, the TSE currently has three smaller markets, the role of which -- and the distinctions between them -- have been blurred.
FSA officials said the reform has never been about restricting the number of companies on the main board and that its focus is to streamline the current complicated structure of the exchange.
The FSA panel proposed the TSE should divide the market into three classes -- ""prime market"" for high quality shares, ""standard market"" for smaller firms and ""growth market"" for start-up and venture firms.
The panel also proposed the exchange should revise the way it calculates free-float shares. It currently excludes top 10 big shareholders from free-float shares.
An official from the Financial Services Agency said the details still need to be worked out, including how to count the shares held by the Bank of Japan through its ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) purchase.
The report will be discussed at a panel meeting on Wednesday, the FSA official also told reporters.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 05:51AM ET</span>",How risky ETFs won the decade - and why they might not repeat that performance,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exchange-traded funds that use leverage to offer double or triple the daily return of benchmark U.S. stock indexes rank among the 10 top-performing funds of the decade, with returns that in some cases neared 2,000%, despite warnings that they are not suitable for most investors. 
The huge gains for leveraged ETFs reflect the benefits of betting on growth during the longest bull market in history. But they also highlight the subtle ways in which record-low volatility bolstered investors. 
High volatility hurts leveraged ETFs by adding costs to the daily rebalancing trades necessary to maintain leverage.
Fund experts and analysts caution that the outsized returns for leveraged funds may not be repeated in the decade ahead. 
""This was virtually the perfect decade. You had very low volatility, very low borrowing costs, and above-average market returns,"" said William Trainor, a professor at East Tennessee State University who specializes in the study of leveraged ETFs. 
While leveraged funds will outperform other options in the decade ahead, Trainor said, rising borrowing costs over the next 3 to 4 years will likely weigh on possible gains.
""I don't think we will see the returns that we've seen again,"" he said. 
The Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X ETF (P:TECL), for instance, returned nearly 1,920% between the start of 2010 through November of this year, according to Morningstar data, the biggest gain among the roughly 10,000 mutual funds and ETFs available in the United States. The ProShares Ultra QQQ (P:QLD), which offers two times the daily return of the Nasdaq 100 index, posted the second-best return with a nearly 1,330% gain over the decade. 
The top actively managed U.S. stock fund over the decade, by comparison, gained 441%, led by the Virtus KAR Small-Cap Growth fund, the Fidelity Select Retailing fund, and the Berkshire Focus fund. 
Despite their outperformance, leveraged funds remain more suitable for tactical investors such as hedge funds than long-term investors, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. 
""You can be very, very right or very, very wrong [with the use of leverage] and that can also reverse itself relatively quickly,"" he said. 
Investors in exchange-traded notes that made leveraged bets on volatility, for instance, suffered one-day losses of 90% in February, 2018, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged. 
Approximately $35 billion in assets is invested in leveraged ETFs and mutual funds, according to Refinitiv Lipper data, with most investors holding the funds for only a few days or weeks at a time. 
Robert Nestor, president of leveraged-fund provider Direxion, said that the firm is expecting much of its growth to come in providing funds with no net leverage that appeal to longer-term investors interested in issues such as ESG, a catch-all term for investing in companies that focus on environmental, social, and governance issues. 
""We're looking at things that are relevant to other big pockets of assets and investors that don't have or want high levels or leverage,"" he said.

1139,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 05:39AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The Best and Worst of Europe in 2019,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Hats off to you if, at the start of the year, you had a portfolio stuffed full of Greek banks, Belgian biotech, Italian sports cars and highly leveraged French telecoms companies.
By the same token, if you bet on Scandinavian banks, British sports cars and highly leveraged oilfield services companies, then, well, better luck next year.
Trying to identify patterns into why some bets paid off and others didn’t is a task always distorted by hindsight, but for what it’s worth, we’ll try to make some sense of the highs and lows of 2019.
Take banking, which has a mean reversion story on steroids. The two best performers in the European space have been Greece’s Piraeus Bank (AT:BOPr) and National Bank of Greece (AT:NBGr), whose valuations have rocketed as the country has recovered from its worst economic crisis in a generation. At the other end of the scale, three of the four worst performers –   Swedbank   (ST:SWEDa),   Danske Bank   (CSE:DANSKE) and ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) – have been hit hard by allegations of turning a blind eye to money-laundering in pursuit of a quick buck. Earnings that seemed too good to be true in the last cycle have turned out to be just that.
It’s a very different story in automotive, where the sector’s best and worst performances have come from the same high-performance niche. On the one hand, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) has gone from strength to strength thanks to a broad diversification of sales by geography, underpinned by solid contributions from less volatile merchandising and branding rights and long-term owners steeped in their knowledge of the car industry. On the other,   Aston Martin   Lagonda (LON:AML) has fallen 58% as it struggles with a Brexit-depressed U.K. and European market, without any meaningful cushion from licensing revenue. It has at least brought its new SUV plant online but has had to borrow at loan-shark rates to do so. The company's private-equity owners have arguably added less value than the Agnelli family vehicle Exor (MI:EXOR) has to Ferrari's.
In utilities, there has been a stark contrast between those who have bet heavily on renewables and those saddled with big fossil fuel businesses and high legacy costs. Danish wind farm operator Oersted (CSE:ORSTED) has risen 68%, while the U.K.’s old gas monopoly   Centrica   (LON:CNA) has fallen 33%.
That same dichotomy between forward-looking and history-burdened has also been evident in food retail. Ocado (LON:OCDO), which has evolved emphatically into a technology company from a consumer-facing delivery brand, has risen 62% thanks to a series of transformative deals with U.S. and Japanese supermarket chains. Spain’s DIA (BS:DIAe), by contrast, has lost 78%.
In fashion, too, it has been the technology-focused, online-only names of Zalando (DE:ZALG) and boohoo.com (LON:BOOH) that have fared best, while those most rooted in their high street stores, from high-end   Hugo Boss   (DE:BOSSn) to dowdy Marks & Spencer (LON:MKS), have struggled. 
Not that tech is immune to failure, especially where there are questions of governance. German payments company Wirecard (DE:WDIG), which started the year as one of the biggest hopes for many investors, has lost 20% thanks to governance questions which refuse to go away, for all the company’s denials of impropriety.
Finally - debt, and the ability to manage it, has as ever played a big role in many of the year’s success and failure stories. French telecoms group Altice (AS:ATCA) has more than tripled as the results of its efforts to escape a debt trap two years ago finally paid off. At the other end of the scale,   Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA   (OL:NWC) has found itself trapped after a big leveraged bet that the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX would transform the economics of discounted transatlantic flight. Its compatriots at   Seadrill   (OL:SDRL), which emerged from bankruptcy last year still carrying too much debt for comfort, no doubt sympathise. "

FINRA, the securities industry self-regulator, and the exchanges found that  Credit Suisse  Securities (USA) LLC did not establish a supervisory system reasonably designed to monitor for potential trading violations, such as spoofing and layering, for clients it had offered direct market access to numerous exchanges between 2010 and 2014.
The exchanges backing the fine are Cboe Global Markets, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, the New York Stock Exchange, and their affiliated exchanges.
""In addition, Credit Suisse violated numerous provisions of the market access rule, which requires broker-dealers that provide their customers access to an exchange or an alternative trading system to reasonably manage the financial and regulatory risks of providing such access,"" FINRA said in a statement.
From 2011 to 2017, Credit Suisse violated the market access rule's provisions related to the prevention of erroneous orders, the setting of credit limits and the firm's annual review of the effectiveness of its market access controls and supervisory procedures, the statement said.
In settling the matter, Credit Suisse neither admitted nor denied the charges, the statement added.

TP ICAP (LON:NXGN) (LON:TCAPI), the city’s biggest independent broking firm, said it has agreed to buy Louis Capital for $21 million up front.
Further performance-related payments could take the final sum up to $44 million over the next five years.
The firm, which specializes in cash equities, equity derivatives, fixed income and small cap advisory services, made a profit before tax of $4.3 million in 2018. It has 77 front office employees.
The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.

Infrastructure group John Laing (LON:JLG) said it will invest A$51.5 million ($36 millon) in a waste-to-energy plant in Rockingham, Western Australia.
The project has been co-developed by organisations including New Energy Corporation, Hitachi Zosen Inova (HZI), Acciona, and Tribe Infrastructure Group. The plant is expected to be operational by 2023.

 
  Bodycote   (LON:BOY), which supplies thermal processing services to the aerospace and automotive industries, said it has agreed to buy Ellison Surface Technologies for $170 million after tax-related benefits.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2019 01:13AM ET</span>",U.S. activist investors post strong gains as needling companies pays off,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investors who are shaking up Corporate America with calls for operational fixes, refreshed boards and even sales of a company are delivering their best returns in six years with double-digit gains for 2019 after big losses in 2018.
The surge in returns is energizing experienced corporate agitators as well as newcomers and may force more companies into costly battles with shareholders over their corporate future next year, managers, lawyers and bankers said.
Through the end of November, activist managers on average returned 13.09%, according to data from Hedge Fund Research, which tracks various investment strategies' returns. Fueled by high double-digit returns at funds run by William Ackman, Barry Rosenstein and Glenn Welling among others, activists are handily outperforming all other types of hedge funds where the average fund returned 8.5% this year, HFR data shows.
The gains illustrate a sharp recovery from 2018 when the average activist lost 10.4%, in part because a late-year stock market tumble erased gains at many funds.
Hedge funds run by activist investors are traditionally reserved for institutional investors and wealthy private clients.
To be sure, activists are benefiting from this year's strong stock market gains where the Standard & Poor's 500 index (SPX) has climbed 28.5% so far. But many added spice with demands for changes or by watching earlier prodding pay off.
""Many of the initiatives that were advocated for by our managers resulted in improved performance,"" said Gregg Hymowitz, chief executive officer of EnTrust Global, a large investor with activist managers.
Through the middle of December, Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Holdings portfolio gained 57%, lifted by investments including  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG), where Ackman helped install a new chief executive officer last year.
Douglas Braunstein's Hudson Executive Capital gained 52% through the end of November, fueled by gains at  Cardtronics  Plc (O:CATM) which gave Braunstein a board seat last year.
Some investors returned with fresh demands directed at companies they had previously targeted. Glenn Welling's Engaged Capital, which is up 30% through November, came back to nutrition and weight loss company Medifast Inc (N:MED) while Jana Partners took a second run at restaurant chain Bloomin' Brands Inc (O:BLMN), which may consider selling itself. Corvex Management is up nearly 20% through the end of November, months after its founder, Keith Meister, joined the board of MGM Resorts International (N:MGM).
Representatives of the funds declined to comment.
In the United States alone, activists targeted 464 companies this year through mid-December, roughly the same number as last year, data from Activist Insight shows.
Next year, activists may perform even better, investors and managers said, noting there are plenty of inefficiencies to repair at smaller companies.
While fresh money many not chase this year's strong returns as investors worry that a recession will hit at some point, investors said they are willing to fund specific campaigns in so-called special purpose vehicles.
""Activists are value investors, which are starting to become more in favor,"" said Ken Squire, who runs 13D Monitor and the 13D Activist Fund. ""Over the past 15 years, activists went from being frowned upon to being accepted and now respected."""

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese social media firm ByteDance has no plans to sell part or all of its TikTok app, the short video platform's head said on Tuesday, denying a media report which said the company was currently weighing options to do so due to U.S. concerns. 
Bloomberg reported on Monday that the company was considering a TikTok stake sale. 
""From time to time you may read stories in the media that are not true. Today there is an inaccurate report claiming that ByteDance has considered selling part or all of TikTok,"" Alex Zhu said in an internal company note seen by Reuters.
""We went on the record saying it was not true, but they decided to publish it anyway. I want to assure you that we have had no discussions with potential buyers of TikTok, nor do we have any intention to.""
A ByteDance spokeswoman declined to comment on the internal note but reiterated that there had ""been no discussions about any partial or full sale of TikTok"". 
""These rumors are completely meritless,"" she added.
ByteDance has been seeking to ringfence TikTok, popular with teenagers in the United States, from much of its Chinese operations to assure U.S. regulatory officials that personal data held by the app is stored securely in America and will not be compromised by Chinese authorities.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security risks, is looking into ByteDance's $1 billion purchase of social media app Musical.ly in 2017 that laid the foundations for TikTok's rapid growth, Reuters has reported.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2019 11:07PM ET</span>",Boeing fires CEO Muilenburg to restore confidence amid 737 crisis,"By Ankit Ajmera and Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has fired Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg after repeatedly failing to contain the fallout from a pair of fatal crashes that halted output of its best-selling jetliner and tarnished its reputation with airlines and regulators.
Boeing - beset by one setback after another following the two air disasters - dropped Muilenburg as it became increasingly clear that he was making little headway resolving a crisis that has cost it $9 billion, hurt suppliers and airlines and now threatens to cut the pace of U.S. economic growth.
Chairman David Calhoun, a former  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) executive who has been on the Boeing board since 2009, will take over as CEO and president, effective from Jan. 13, Boeing said. Until then, Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith will run the world's largest planemaker.
""The board of directors decided that a change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence,"" a Boeing statement said. A Boeing official said the board had deliberated over the weekend and decided to oust Muilenburg in a phone call on Sunday.
Muilenburg could not be reached for comment.
Boeing shares, which have dropped more than 20% over the past nine months, closed up 2.9%.
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months.
Boeing is struggling to mend relations with the U.S. and international regulators it needs to win over to get the jet back in the air.
After keeping assembly lines open and storing 400 planes to be ready for a return to flight, Boeing acknowledged this month it would not be able to reach its target of flying this year and announced it would halt 737 MAX production in January.
Boeing on Monday said shipments from 737 suppliers will be suspended for a month starting mid-January, adding that it was uncertain when production would restart.
Economists estimate that will lower overall U.S. economic growth by half a percentage point.
Muilenburg's departure followed a week of dramatic setbacks for Boeing, which vies with Europe's Airbus for leadership of the $150 billion jet industry.
They ranged from a decision to halt production of the MAX, to a public slap-down from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a ratings downgrade and a space launch glitch on Friday.
Late Monday, the FAA confirmed it had received a new batch of documents from Boeing related to the MAX and was reviewing them. A person briefed on the matter confirmed a Seattle Times report that the new submission contained instant messages from a former Boeing senior pilot, Mark Forkner.
In October, Boeing turned over 2016 messages to the FAA between Forkner and another pilot that said he might have unintentionally misled the FAA and raised questions about the performance of a key safety system during testing. Boeing had earlier turned over the documents to the Justice Department, which has an ongoing criminal investigation into the MAX.
Based on Boeing securities filings, Muilenburg may be eligible for nearly $39 million in severance. Boeing declined to comment on the figure or whether he would accept it.
Boeing said last month Muilenburg had volunteered to give up his 2019 bonus and stock awards. For 2018, his bonus and equity awards amounted to some $20 million, according to filings.
His dismissal received backing from Peter DeFazio, chair of the U.S. House of Representatives' transportation committee. 
""It’s clear Dennis Muilenburg’s ouster was long overdue,"" he said. ""Under his watch, a long-admired company made a number of devastating decisions that suggest profit took priority over safety.""
'RIGHT TOOL KIT?'
Calhoun, who is resigning from Blackstone (NYSE:BX) to take the top job at Boeing, was respected by the industry, said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group.
""But long term, does he bring the right tool kit? Private equity leans companies out. That's not Boeing's problem right now.""
Boeing - which has taken flak from the Federal Aviation Administration for appearing to pressure the regulator by predicting when the MAX fly - pledged full transparency. It named a veteran PR boss from the auto industry.
""We don't think it is controversial to suggest that Boeing's MAX response has been a failure - and as a result we think it is wholly appropriate for the board to replace Muilenburg,"" said Robert Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners.
Muilenburg, an engineer who started at Boeing as an intern in 1985, fought a rising tide of public and regulatory scrutiny to try to steady the company during the crisis. He initiated a broad safety initiative involving heavy investments in training but was unable to shake off a set of awkward public appearances.
'WE'VE MADE MISTAKES'
Muilenburg acknowledged errors in failing to give pilots more information on a stall-prevention system before the crashes and for taking months to disclose that it had made optional an alarm that alerts pilots to a mismatch of flight data.
""We've made mistakes and we got some things wrong. We're improving and we're learning,"" he told lawmakers in October. 
Speculation that he would be fired had been circulating in the industry for months, intensifying in October when the board stripped him of his chairman title - although he had also twice won expressions of confidence from Calhoun.
Muilenburg was credited with halting a drift in the company's defense division and reshaping Boeing's management.
But by keeping Muilenburg as long as it did, some experts say Boeing ignored part of the crisis communications playbook.

""You want to bring somebody from the outside to bring fresh perspective to 'save the day,'"" said Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. ""He should have been gone a long time ago. He is part of the problem.""

Concern over corporate governance and the tumbling stock price have made it difficult to sell the third and final tranche of the shares, the people said, asking not to be named as the discussions are private. The timing of share sales for next fiscal year onward is also still unclear, they said. Japan’s financial regulator is considering penalties against the postal group after reports of misconduct in selling insurance policies.
Insurance Scandal Destroyed Trust in Japan Post, Panel Finds (1)
An official at Japan’s Ministry of Finance said that no concrete decision has been made over suspending the stock sale plan. A spokesman for Japan Post Holdings declined to comment, saying the decision is up to the ministry.
The finance ministry’s earlier plan to sell up to 1.06 billion shares as early as September was clouded when Japan Post Insurance Co. customers were found to be potentially getting worse terms after switching to new policies recommended by salesmen. Japan’s Financial Services Agency may issue a business improvement order to the parent, while an official has been punished over leaking information about those measures, Kyodo News said in separate reports this month.
The government is aiming to secure 4 trillion yen ($36.6 billion) from sales of Japan Post Holdings stock by the year ending March 2023 to fund recovery efforts from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and have so far gathered about 2.8 trillion yen through the first two rounds.
Shares of Japan Post Holdings have dropped about 19% this year and are trading below the 1,132 yen threshold that will allow the government to secure the remaining 1.2 trillion yen."

Once a front-runner in China’s debt-fueled global spending spree, HNA is scheduled to repay a 1.3 billion yuan ($185 million) local bond Tuesday.
Earlier this month, HNA said it would halt trading of this bond from Dec. 6 till its maturity due to an unspecified “major event that has yet to be finalized”. It didn’t give any details. The suspended bond last traded at 97.55 yuan on Dec. 5.
HNA has periodically been in the news in recent years for missing payments, selling assets and struggling with debts that climbed to as high as 598.2 billion yuan.
Haikou Meilan International Airport, a major airport backed by HNA units on the southern Hainan island, has defaulted on two private onshore notes totaling 3 billion yuan and a $200 million dollar-denominated bond, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
While HNA itself failed to make good on a 1.5 billion yuan privately issued note in July, the conglomerate has yet to miss a repayment on a public bond, according to Bloomberg calculations.
“The main concern is a lack of liquidity and the complex structure of the group that makes moving money within the organization difficult,” said Warut Promboon, managing partner at credit research firm Bondcritic Ltd. “However, we believe HNA has sufficient credit facilities to pay back bondholders should its creditors allow them to do so,” he said.
Calls to HNA’s office responsible for information disclosure went unanswered.
A bond due in 2021 from by HNA’s unit Hainan Airlines Holding Co. was up by 0.36 yuan to 88.99 yuan as of 10:35 a.m. Hong Kong time. Traders have been closely monitoring this bond as a gauge of broader sentiment about the conglomerate since HNA’s local note was suspended.
HNA shot to prominence between 2016 and 2017 after splurging more than $40 billion on acquisitions across six continents. The once little-known airline operator became the biggest shareholder of iconic companies such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) as well as paying top dollar for high-end properties from Manhattan to Hong Kong.
The company and other equally acquisitive private firms have since come under pressure from Beijing to sell off assets due to concerns that their borrowing sprees could worsen the nation’s debt burden and destabilize its financial system."

The deal includes a mix of Airbus A319, A320, and A321 models, the company said.
The purchase agreement finalizes an October provisional deal for the aircraft, when Spirit picked European planes despite Washington imposing tariffs on them.
Depending on the number of each variant of the A320 single-aisle family chosen, the deal could be worth $11 billion to $12 billion at the most recent 2018 Airbus list prices, but industry sources say such deals typically involve discounts of at least 50%.
Washington has imposed 10% tariffs on some of the planes Airbus offers to U.S. carriers, as part of a long-running transatlantic trade dispute over aircraft subsidies.
Spirit currently operates an all-Airbus fleet of 140 jets.

Aircraft are typically ordered several years in advance, meaning any planes ordered now would only be covered by tariffs in the event of an extended transatlantic tariff war. Airbus jets assembled at a plant in Alabama are not currently included.

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2019 03:38PM ET</span>",Forget store traffic and bag count: Gauging retail performance in an online world,"By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Marshal Cohen has religiously visited the same stores every holiday season since 1999. 
But rather than snapping up bargains and favorite gifts for friends and family, the chief retail industry adviser is there to scrutinize the purchasing habits of others as online shopping upends the retail business.
Major shifts in consumer behavior and preferences have forced Cohen, who works for market research firm NPD Group, and other retail analysts to approach their jobs very differently than two decades ago.
""If you were to try and replicate research methodology, or even store observation, in today's world, you've got a problem,"" Cohen told Reuters. ""It's no longer good enough to just look at store traffic or parking lot counts.""
Cohen and his peers need to get it right because their insights, reported to investors and retail clients, influence marketing, move share prices and guide investment decisions.
A record number of U.S. consumers spending more online, coupled with a condensed holiday shopping season and year-round discount wars among retailers, has forced analysts to get creative, with many shifting away from old-school tactics to measure a company's overall performance.
Instead of simply asking shoppers why they left a store empty-handed, analysts are probing the effect of online giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), asking whether customers started Christmas shopping in July on Prime Day, now a major event in the annual retail calendar to rival Thanksgiving weekend's Black Friday.
Calculation of sales per square foot is giving way to a tally of how many Instagram-native, exclusive and private fashion brands are offered on a retailer's sales floor and website, and analysts -- rather than simply seeing how many bags a shopper leaves with -- are now counting how many younger millennial and Gen Z shoppers frequent a store and whether they make a purchase. 
Craig Johnson of Consumer Growth Partners says that traditional metrics such as foot traffic, average selling price, and average basket size can often still be highly indicative of what's happening in stores.
But other retail analysts said online shopping and a slew of services like ""buy online, pick up in-store"" can hinder the ability to estimate a retailer's conversion rate - a traditional measure of the proportion of visitors who make purchases.
Brian Field, senior director of global retail consulting for ShopperTrak, part of retail data firm Sensormatic Solutions, said it was particularly difficult to figure out if traffic reported by retailers came from people buying items in-store or shoppers picking up online orders. ""It is kind of synonymous with the fact that retailers are reporting blended sales, which include sales online and sales in-store together,"" Field said. 
""I think what it really boils down to is the customer journey has changed - it can start anywhere, in-store, online and end anywhere.""
SUSPICIONS 
When Marie Driscoll, Coresight Research's managing director of luxury and fashion, received an email from Saks Fifth Avenue less than a week before Black Friday alerting her that several small leather designer goods such as wallets were on sale, she took note.
The department store, she thought, might have been struggling to sell such items, which are often given as gifts.
Saks, owned by Hudson's Bay Company, disagreed.
""It would be flawed to gauge category performance based on customer emails, as the majority include personalized recommendations derived from a client's shopping preferences,"" a company spokesperson said.
Consumer Growth Partners' Johnson keeps close tabs on how many fashion brands born on Instagram are on the sales floor when he visits  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) these days. That tells him whether the retailer is catering to young shoppers who search for labels on their smartphones.
A source with knowledge of the matter said Nordstrom looks for opportunities to launch new brands and expand existing partnerships with limited distribution and emerging brands to differentiate their product line.
FLYING BLIND 
U.S holiday retail sales during November and December are expected to increase by around 4% from 2018 to as much as $730.7 billion, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF) - a percentage rise dwarfed by the 13.6% annual jump Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics has already seen in online sales between Nov. 1 and Dec. 19, to $125.6 billion.

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's government does not have an alternative proposal for the privatization of power holding company Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (SA:ELET6) which appears headed for rejection in the Senate, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
Last week, Senate President Davi Alcolumbre said the bill proposed by the government for the privatization of Eletrobras, as the company is known, will not be approved by senators due to resistance from the Northeastern and Northern regions. The power holding company controls nearly a third of power generation and around half of all power transmission in Brazil.
The privatization bill was sent by President Jair Bolsonaro's government to Congress last month. But Alcolumbre said senators from the Northeastern and Northern regions are against the privatization model. Brazil's government proposes to privatize Eletrobras through a share issuance that would dilute the government's controlling stake.
The vote on the Eletrobras bill is not yet scheduled.
The proceeds of the share issuance would be used by Eletrobras to pay the federal government to extend the licenses to operate most of its power generation assets.
Government sources said there is no alternative plan and that Bolsonaro's government will try to convince Congress to approve the current version of the bill.
The privatization of Eletrobras has been under discussion since the government of former President Michel Temer, who left office at the end of last year. The impending privatization has contributed to a 51% rise of its preferred shares (SA:ELET6) over the last 12 months."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and a group of China banks have agreed a new 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion), five-year loan facility for the automaker's Shanghai car plant, three sources familiar with the matter said, part of which will be used to roll over an existing loan.
China Construction Bank (HK:0939) (SS:601939) (CCB), Agricultural Bank of China (HK:1288) (SS:601288) (AgBank), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (SS:601398) (HK:1398) (ICBC) and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SS:600000) (SPDB) are among the banks which have agreed to give Tesla the financial support, one source with direct knowledge said. 
The Chinese banks earlier this year already offered Tesla a 12-month facility of up to 3.5 billion yuan, which is due to be repaid on March 4, 2020, according to a filing the automaker made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
That new loan will be partially used to roll over the previous 3.5 billion yuan debt, according to the first source. The second source said the rest will be used on the factory and Tesla's China operations.
The new loan's interest rate will be pegged at 90% of China's one-year benchmark interest rate, the same as the 3.5 billion yuan loan, the first source said. This is a rate that China banks offer to their best clients. 
Tesla, CCB, AgBank, ICBC and SPDB did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Tesla broke ground on the factory in January and has started producing vehicles from its Shanghai plant. It aims to build at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week by the end of this year.
The factory, which is Tesla's first car manufacturing site outside the United States, is the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world's biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S.-made cars. 
The Shanghai government has also thrown its support behind the Tesla project, which would be China's first wholly foreign-owned car plant and a reflection of the government's broader shift to open up its car market.

Tesla shares rose to over 3.6% in Monday's session to cross $420 for the first time. Elon Musk had last year proposed to take the company private for $420 but later abandoned the bid under pressure from investors and regulators.

In recent months, Tesla's shares have had a run of good fortune on the back of a rare quarterly profit reported in October, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and upbeat early deposits for its recently launched electric pickup truck.
Orders for the company's Cybertruck have reached close to the record set by its Model 3 sedans in 2016.
""Whoa … the stock is so high lol,"" Musk tweeted on Monday, after Tesla shares crossed the $420 mark. The number 420 is closely associated with marijuana as a slang for the consumption of cannabis. It also refers to cannabis-related celebrations that take place annually on April 20.
The take-private tweet in August last year, at a time when Tesla was trading in the mid-$330s, had taken shares as high as $387. Later in the month, shares were closer to $320 amid intense regulatory scrutiny.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange commission fined Musk and Tesla $20 million each for the $420 tweet. Musk was also forced to step down as chairman and must submit any public statements about Tesla's finances and other topics to be vetted by a legal counsel.
Reuters reported earlier on Monday the company and a group of Chinese banks have agreed to a new 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion), five-year loan facility for the automaker's Shanghai car plant.
Tesla shares rose over 3.6% in Monday's session and are up nearly 65% since the quarterly report in October."

In July, BBVA (MC:BBVA) acknowledged damage to its reputation from allegations that in 2004 it hired Grupo Cenyt, a security firm belonging to a former police commissioner Jose Manuel Villarejo, to investigate officials of construction company Sacyr (MC:SCYR) and keep eyes on leading politicians.
But the bank, one of Europe's largest, also said then the allegations had no impact on its business, and its internal investigation had thus far not found any evidence of spying.
The former chairman of BBVA, Francisco Gonzalez, is under investigation as part of the probe, along with Villarejo.
Spain's High Court could not immediately confirm or deny the information. The ECB declined to comment.
Spanish radio Cadena Ser said the request came after BBVA failed to send any information on the progress of the investigation in response to ECB's initial request.
In a statement sent to Reuters, BBVA said only that it had communicated to the ECB that Spanish court secrecy laws prevented it from disclosing any details of the case and that the only way to obtain information was directly from the judge.
According to Cadena Ser, the European financial regulator had guaranteed to Judge Manuel Garcia-Castellon that it would keep any information provided completely confidential. The court had not yet responded, it said.
Villarejo was arrested in 2017 as part of a separate investigation and is in prison awaiting trial over allegations of money laundering and bribing public officials."

Two sources at Democratic Republic of Congo's prosecutor's office and two at the presidency, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the investigation was focused on possible money laundering and fraud related to a loan issued in October 2017 by Gertler's Fleurette Mumi, which has since been renamed Ventora Development. 
In a statement, Gecamines interim director-general Jacques Kamenga confirmed that a company official was questioned by prosecutors last week, without naming the person. Kamenga denied any wrongdoing and said Gecamines provided investigators with all requested documents. 
Gertler's spokesperson referred Reuters to a statement by Ventora Development, which said it issued the loan and was simply trying to recover money it was owed by Gecamines. 
Kamenga could not be immediately reached by Reuters for comment. 
Both Gecamines and Gertler have faced corruption allegations from watchdog groups over the past decade related to the sale of mining assets in Congo, which, despite copious mineral resources, is one of the world's poorest countries. 
According to a 2013 report by the Africa Progress Panel, which was headed by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Congo lost out on $1.36 billion in potential revenue between 2010 and 2012 in five mining deals involving Gecamines and Gertler.
The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Gertler and more than 30 of his businesses in December 2017 and June 2018, accusing him of using his friendship with former Congo President Joseph Kabila to secure sweetheart mining deals.
Gertler, Kabila and Gecamines have denied all allegations of impropriety. 
Gecamines' Kamenga said the company ended up borrowing 128 million euros from Fleurette Mumi's line of credit in October 2017, two months before the U.S. imposed sanctions. Kamenga said Gecamines used the money to pay tax advances in Congo. 
Gertler's Amsterdam-based Fleurette Group was a joint venture partner of Gecamines in one Congo copper mine and said in 2014 that it lent Gecamines $196 million in 2013 to purchase two other copper mines. 
Because of the U.S. sanctions against Gertler, Gecamines was advised by its lawyers not to reimburse the loan, Kamenga said in his statement on Monday. 
Ventora Development sued Gecamines in October for repayment of the loan and a Congolese court ordered Gecamines last month to pay nearly 152 million euros of the loan principal and interest, Kamenga and Ventora said. Gecamines has appealed the ruling and not yet made any payment, Kamenga added. 
On Dec. 17, Kamenga and another Gecamines official were prevented by immigration authorities from boarding a flight in the Congolese capital Kinshasa and told they were banned from traveling, Kamenga said. 
Two days later, they were summoned by the prosecutor's office in Kinshasa, where a Gecamines official was questioned about the loan, Kamenga said.
The four sources at the prosecutor's office and the presidency said that the chairman of the Gecamines board, Albert Yuma, had been also banned from leaving the country. 
Yuma is a close ally of Kabila, who left office in January after 18 years as president. Reached for comment, Yuma referred Reuters to Kamenga's statement.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2019 11:33AM ET</span>",Buffett protege Todd Combs to become Geico CEO,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Geico, the auto insurer owned by  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), on Monday named Todd Combs, one of Warren Buffett's portfolio managers, as its chief executive officer, adding new responsibilities for a man widely seen as a potential successor to Buffett.
Combs, 48, will take over the second-largest U.S. auto insurer on Jan. 1, 2020, replacing Bill Roberts, a 35-year Geico veteran who became chief executive in June 2018. Roberts will become a Geico vice chairman and plans to retire at the end of 2020.
Geico, which has about 40,000 employees, said Combs will continue managing $14 billion of investments at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he joined in 2010.
""That's an awful lot of work for one person,"" said Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst with a ""market perform"" rating on Berkshire.
""Warren Buffett has talked about the overlap between being a good investor and a good businessperson,"" Shields said. ""This puts that into action, letting Combs broaden his operational expertise."" 
Many investors and analysts consider Combs and Buffett's other portfolio manager, Ted Weschler, top candidates to succeed the billionaire as Berkshire's chief investment officer.
Combs, who once worked at Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Insurance, is also a JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) director and helped launch Haven, the project Berkshire, JPMorgan and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) launched to reduce their employees' healthcare costs. 
Berkshire and Geico did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Combs is nine years younger than Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel, widely considered a top candidate to succeed Buffett, 89, as Berkshire's CEO.
""I don't think this is a predecessor to [Combs] being Berkshire's CEO,"" Shields said, referring to the Geico appointment. ""There is more experience embedded in Greg Abel, and if he takes over it is good for Berkshire to have a deep bench.""
Geico is one of Buffett's oldest investments, dating from 1951, when he plowed more than half his net worth into the insurer.
Berkshire took full control of Geico in 1996, paying $2.3 billion for the 49% it did not already own.
From January to September, Geico generated $1.18 billion of underwriting profit as premiums rose 7% to $26.49 billion.
Tony Nicely, Geico's executive chairman and Roberts' predecessor, said Roberts told him in early November he was turning 70 and planned to step aside.

Roberts joined Geico in 1984 in its marketing department. He was a key driver of its humorous ad campaigns, some featuring a talking gecko. Rivals such as Allstate (NYSE:ALL), Liberty Mutual and Progressive now also use humor in ads.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are poised to close out the decade with the longest bull market in history still intact.
The run, which began on March 9, 2009, has narrowly avoided falling into a bear market several times over the past 10 years but for now appears on track to continue into next year.
With less than two weeks left in the decade, the large cap S&P 500 (SPX), with reinvested dividends, has easily outperformed other major asset classes and benchmark commodities, climbing over 250%. The Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) US Aggregate Bond Index , a broad-based index that includes Treasuries, corporate bonds and other fixed-income products, rose 47 percent. At the other end of the spectrum, WTI crude oil lost more than 20% over the same period.
(GRAPHIC: Asset performance for 2010-2019 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/36/36/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Buoyed in part by an accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, which drove bond yields to near historic lows, the S&P 500 has been the best performing benchmark equity index over the decade out of the 10 largest global economies.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. stocks vs the world - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/128/128/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
But while this has been the longest bull run on record, the Twenty-tens fell short of the showing for several prior decades for equities. The best of the past eight - dating to the 1940s - was the '90s, which topped 300%, followed by the '50s and the '80s, both north of 200%.
(GRAPHIC: S&P performance by decade - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-MARKETS-DECADE-WINNERS/0H001QXR5B1D/eikon.png)
The gains in the U.S. stock market were fueled by the technology (SPLRCT) and consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) sectors, with each climbing more than 300% over the decade. Energy (SPNY) was the weakest group, narrowly avoiding a loss and was up only 4.3% through the Dec. 19 close.
(GRAPHIC: Sector performance for the decade - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/122/122/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
While investors showed virtually no preference between growth (RAG) or value (RAV) stocks in the early years of the decade, growth as an investing style has handily outperformed value stocks in the last leg of the '10s.
(GRAPHIC: Growth vs value stocks for the decade - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/123/123/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
The preference for growth names is also reflected in the performance of individual stocks over the decade, led by the gain in Netflix (O:NFLX), which notched a staggering 4100% through the Dec. 19 close.

1172,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 23, 2019 09:47AM ET</span>",Christmas Eve’s Stock Apocalypse Was Another Buy-the-Dip Moment,"(Bloomberg) -- Steve Chiavarone was rethinking his gift list.
It was the night before Christmas last year, the worst moment of Wall Street’s bleakest holiday season in decades. Staring at another 400-plus-point plunge in the Dow, its fifth in seven days, the Federated Investors fund manager worried he’d been too generous with presents for the kids.
“Market’s going the wrong way and you’re worried. ‘Hey, did I spend too much?”’ said Chiavarone, whose firm has around $530 billion in client assets. “The Christmas goose didn’t taste as good that night.”
Holidays are supposed to be a time of peace. Last year, they offered a glimpse of the apocalypse. American equities careened toward their worst December since the Depression. Down 1,655 points the week before, the Dow plunged 653 more by the 1 p.m. close Christmas Eve, ruining everyone’s mood.
In the end, it all turned out to be a giant buying opportunity -- stocks went straight up when markets reopened. But for people managing money on Christmas 2018, it’s a trauma they won’t soon forget. The S&P 500 slid to its lowest point in 19 months, with $600 billion in market value erased. The biggest four-day slump in more than three years had just happened and nothing suggested it was over.
“My thought was that I’m glad the market’s closing early today,” said David Sowerby, a portfolio manager at Ancora Advisors. After the day ended, “I did what any self-respecting portfolio manager would do. I went to the gym to work out and relieve some stress.”
Threats were everywhere. You had Donald Trump railing against the Federal Reserve. The government was shut down. Uncertainty over economic growth was rampant. News that the president was privately mulling firing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sent anxiety swirling. At one point, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin got on the phone with Wall Street banks, checking on their liquidity and infrastructure. It was supposed to restore calm but just made everything worse.
For a day. It was tough to see, but stocks were offering some of the best bargains in a decade. The benchmark index has jumped more than 35% from the nadir that day, hitting repeated records along the way. A gauge of fear in the stock market, the Cboe Volatility Index, has gone from 36 a year ago to 12 now.
This, in 2019, is what the market is supposed to be like around the holidays. Little news, light trading, small moves and low volume. In the five years prior to 2018’s crash, for instance, the biggest swing in the final trading day before the holiday was a gain of about 0.3% on Christmas Eve 2013.
Last year’s pre-Christmas massacre was business as usual for Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors. “I was in that whole time. I didn’t mind. I basically viewed it as being paid to not go to my in-laws,” he said by phone from his San Antonio office. “A lot of the traders we were dealing with were screaming, ‘Oh, my God, the market is falling! It doesn’t look like there’s any end to it!’”
The holiday may have contributed to the volatility, he said, with lower liquidity making for bigger swings. Many desks likely weren’t fully staffed; senior traders were on vacation. In their absence, “there will be a lot of junior traders there, who may not be able to initiate a stance on a position, depending on the rules of their firm,” said Matousek. “A junior trader can’t decide, ‘This is a short-term bottom,’ and start accumulating.”
David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP), recalled that Christmas Eve “had the look and feel of panic selling, based more on fear rather than any change in fundamentals or outlook.” With that backdrop, the market closure was more akin to something of a Christmas miracle.
“Christmas itself gave the market opportunity to take a breather and a second look at things,” he said. The day off “came at a very opportune time.”
As bad as Christmas Eve was for Wall Street, the day after bred relief. Trump called equities bargains in an Oval Office press conference and the S&P 500 spiked near 5% on Dec. 26, its single best session since March 2009. Joy was among the buyers when the market reopened, purchasing an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100 and selling it a few months later for a small gain.
Bryce Doty at Sit Investment Associates also presciently saw the bloodbath as a buying opportunity.
“Whether I was in the office or not I was working -- these are the times that matter,” said the firm’s senior vice president. “There’s only a few days out of the year where there’s really some significant opportunities and that was definitely one of the best ones of the year, even though I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.”"

ROME (Reuters) - Top officials in Italy's ruling coalition will meet on Monday to try to resolve a dispute over plans to make it easier to revoke Atlantia's motorway concession following the deadly collapse of a bridge in Genoa, a government source said.
Shares in  Atlantia  (MI:ATL), which is controlled by the Benetton family, fell 4.2% by 1309 GMT after a cabinet meeting on Saturday provisionally approved a draft decree but left key details to be ironed out.
Atlantia, which owns Italy's biggest motorway operator Autostrade per l'Italia (ASPI), has been in the government's cross-hairs since a bridge collapsed on a busy motorway in August 2018, killing 43 people.
With more than 70 former and current employees at the company and its subsidiaries under investigation in relation to the Genoa disaster, the ruling anti-establishment 5-Star Movement has repeatedly called for the company to be stripped of its motorway concession.
Proceeds from the concession account for around one third of Atlantia's core profits and guarantee several billions of debt issued by Autostrade.
On Saturday, the cabinet failed to agree on the decree due to divergences between the 5-Star Movement and its center-left coalition partners, the Democratic Party (PD) and Italia Viva (IV).
CONTROVERSIAL RULE
A minister for the PD party, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the decree was intended to force Autostrade to accept a revision of the concession, which expires in 2038.
Italia Viva opposes the scheme, saying it may reduce foreign investors' confidence in Italy.
A government source said parties in the ruling coalition were expected to meet in the late afternoon.
The decree says that state-owned company ANAS will temporarily manage motorways if an operator has its concession revoked, a draft document seen by Reuters shows.
It also considerably reduces the amounts the government must pay to a toll road company if a concession is revoked due to shortcomings on the part of the operator.
In a statement issued late on Sunday, Autostrade said the new norm risked violating the Italian constitution, adding that it might take legal steps to protect itself.
Should the government approve the new norm, the company would consider the concession terminated and would ask for multi-billion-euro compensation, Autostrade said in a letter sent to the transport and economy ministries and to the prime minister."

The IPO, tentatively slated for the first half of next year, would raise between $8 billion and $10 billion, Reuters sources said.
JD.com spun off its logistics unit into a standalone entity in 2017, before opening up the unit’s delivery and warehousing services to third parties.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2019 07:19AM ET</span>",Climate activists look for a tougher BlackRock in 2020,"By Ross Kerber, Sinead Cruise and Simon Jessop
BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Pressure on BlackRock Inc's record on climate issues may be having an effect as the world's largest asset manager weighs firming up its interactions with portfolio companies.
The New York-based asset manager has stressed the importance of the societal issues known as ESG, like climate change and workforce diversity, that are popular with younger investors. So far BlackRock has resisted steps sought by critics, such as giving more details of its talks with oil company executives or backing many shareholder resolutions.
But that may be changing as BlackRock prepares for the 2020 proxy season in the spring, said several people who have spoken with BlackRock (N:BLK) executives and hinted at by the company itself.
In a statement emailed by a spokesman BlackRock said that ""We share the concern about climate risk and its impact on shareholder value for all companies. Indeed, we believe evidence of the impact of climate risk on investment portfolios is building rapidly and we are accelerating our engagement with companies on this critical issue.""
The spokesman, Ed Sweeney, did not provide more details. 
Moira Birss, a director of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Watch, which advocates for indigenous peoples and rainforest conservation, said she expects BlackRock may change its engagements with agribusinesses based on recent conversations she held with BlackRock executives.
""It's a positive sign that BlackRock is willing to directly engage with us,"" although it remains to be seen if satisfactory changes result, she said.
Tim Smith of ESG-focussed money manager Boston Trust Walden, who often talks with BlackRock executives, said he expects them to press corporations harder in the coming year to adopt climate-impact reporting guidance. He said BlackRock executives seem more receptive to climate and other concerns heading into 2020, as competing asset managers take more aggressive stands on environmental matters.
""They need to pay attention to this issue, especially if they lose business because of it,"" he said.
Activists say they will be watching for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to outline some new approaches in his annual letter due in January.
Most big fund firms face similar calls to become more active on ESG matters, which they must balance against other client priorities like performance. BlackRock draws the most attention because of its $7 trillion in assets and because it rarely challenges management, even at poor performers, as a Reuters analysis found. 
BlackRock says it lobbies effectively behind closed doors. Previously, BlackRock has made targeted changes like encouraging boards to have at least two women and urging companies to report according to the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.
Critics say the quiet approach undercuts pressure from other shareholders. Cliff Weight, director at ShareSoc, the UK Individual Shareholder Society, said BlackRock could still give more details around its talks with companies. 
Of BlackRock's current disclosures about its engagements, Weight said, ""We question whether this is a marketing exercise"" meant to impress clients.
BlackRock also faces pressure from some public pension funds that have taken a harder look at the ESG practices of fund managers handling their money. Seattle public employee pension officials say they continue to monitor BlackRock's interactions with companies whose shares it owns.
The chief investment officer of Japan's big Government Pension Investment Fund, Hiro Mizuno, has urged asset managers to incorporate ESG into their investment processes.
Annual reports of the Japanese fund show BlackRock managed 2.7 trillion yen ($25 billion) in foreign equities passive money as of March, almost half as much as a year earlier. A fund spokeswoman declined to discuss the change and noted that factors like fees also weigh on allocation shifts. 
BlackRock has given little indication a deep stewardship overhaul is in store, though it has cast a number of high-profile critical votes. One came May 29 against  Exxon Mobil  Corp's (N:XOM) presiding director Steven Reinemund, BlackRock fund disclosures show.
Asked about the vote, an Exxon spokeswoman said, ""We welcome and value input from all shareholders."" 

BlackRock did not explain the vote or say if Exxon was the U.S.-based global energy company of which BlackRock reported it opposed a director due to ""lack of progress on climate-related disclosure.""

The  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (PRA) said the insurance market had agreed to extra checks after informing the regulator its processes had been ineffective.
The PRA said it was first made aware of issues at Lloyd's in February when the market told the regulator its only anonymous whistleblowing channel for staff had not been operational since October 2017.
Other whistleblowing channels were available while the anonymous hotline was down, the PRA said.
Lloyd's also failed to provide an annual whistleblowing report as expected, the regulator added.
Lloyd's has voluntarily agreed to additional requirements, including enhanced reporting of whistleblowing cases and training requirements for senior staff, the PRA said.
Following press reports of widespread misconduct at Lloyd's, the market published results of a survey in September that found nearly one in 12 employees working in the market had witnessed sexual harassment there in the past year, while a quarter had witnessed excessive drinking.
Lloyd's has tried to improve standards of behaviour in the market this year, including introducing life bans from its building and a bullying and harassment hotline.
The Lloyd's market employs nearly 50,000 people and has 99 syndicate members offering insurance in specialist areas from ships to sculptures.
""We are extremely disappointed by this failure in our internal controls, which serves to remind us all about the need for constant vigilance when it comes to these essential services,"" a Lloyd's spokesman said.
""Lloyd's employees can feel confident that we now have all the right mechanisms in place for them to report any wrongdoing, and that these systems are regularly monitored.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Emaar Properties (DU:EMAR) is selling the observation decks of the world's tallest skyscraper the Burj Khalifa, four sources told Reuters, potentially raising $1 billion for Dubai's biggest developer amid a real estate downturn.
Two of the sources said Emaar had appointed  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) to advise it on the sale of the popular ""At The Top"" tourist attraction.
Emaar, in which the Dubai government has a minority stake of 29.2%, and Standard Chartered declined to comment.
At over 828 metres, the Burj Khalifa is twice as tall as New York's Empire State Building and nearly three times the height of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
At The Top is a popular tourist destination in Dubai, which attracted 15.92 million overnight visitors in 2018.
The viewing decks make about 600-700 million dirhams ($163-$191 million) a year, a banking source said.
A financial source estimated they could be worth around $1 billion.
The sales process began in November, both of these sources said, declining to be named as the deal is not public.
Dubai is a regional hub for tourism, foreign trade and business services, but has faced a slowing real estate market for most of the decade.
It set up a real estate planning commission in September to regulate projects and avoid competition between semi-government and private firms.
Emaar has been divesting hospitality related assets to finance existing operations and expansion, an industry source and a Dubai-based banker said.
Emaar hired Standard Chartered earlier this year for the sale of its district cooling business, and last year for the disposal of five hospitality assets, which were sold to Abu Dhabi National Hotels.

The MSCI all-country stock index was flat, just below Friday's record high. It has risen nearly 3% this month as U.S.-China trade tensions eased and confidence grew that Britain would avoid a chaotic exit from the European Union. The index is up 23% so far in 2019, set for its best year since 2009.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday the United States and China would ""very shortly"" sign phase one a trade agreement. It calls for the United States to reduce some tariffs in exchange for China's buying more American farm products.

""The Phase 1 (P1) agreement and UK elections have cleared up tail risks, but the market is now transcending that euphoria,"" said Stephen Innes, strategist at AxiTrader.
""While P1 is already reflected in stock prices, positioning is still relatively light, and with plenty of capital yet to be deployed, markets could even push significantly higher supported by the global growth rebound,"" he added.
On Friday, the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) extended its record highs to seven straight sessions, its longest streak in more than two years. All three major U.S. indexes - the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow - gained. 
Data on Friday showed U.S. growth rose in the third quarter and the economy was probably maintained its expansion as the year ended. Consumer spending was stronger than previously reported, and there were upgrades to business spending. 
During Asian hours on Monday, Japan's Nikkei (N225) was little changed after reaching a 14-month top last week. It was up 2.3% for the month so far. 
Chinese stocks posted their worst single-day drop in six weeks, weighed down by a correction in tech shares after a state fund announced plans to cut its stakes in some chip makers.
The U.S. personal consumption expenditure deflator for November, due on Friday, is the only major economic report this week. 
In currency markets, the euro (EUR=) was at $1.1083, up 0.05% after slipping 0.4% last week. Sterling  was at $1.3027, edging up 0.18% from Friday's three-week low of $1.2976. It slid 2.6% last week for its worst weekly showing since October 2017. The safe-haven Japanese yen was down 0.08% at 109.35.  
That left the dollar index at 97.604, down 0.09% against six major currencies. 
In commodities, Brent crude was down 23 cents to $65.95 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude slipped 24 cents to $60.2 a barrel.
Spot gold was up 0.4% at $1,484.07 an ounce.

Cerberus, a U.S. private equity firm, bought a 3% stake in Germany's flagship bank in 2017. The following year, Cerberus' consulting arm also began advising the bank on how to cut costs and find new sources of revenue, for which Deutsche paid fees. 
That mandate, criticized by some other large shareholders in the bank, is ending, the person said on condition of anonymity. The person said the agreement had reached its natural conclusion.
A  Deutsche Bank  spokesman said Cerberus' advisory business ""has been a great support since mid-2018 and helped us to get our deep transformation going. Now it is all about execution.""
At the bank's annual general meeting this year, Deka Investment, another big Deutsche shareholder, pointed to Cerberus as a ""problematic"" example of Deutsche's corporate governance. 
""Is this a conflict of interest?"" Deka portfolio manager Andreas Thomae asked the bank's chief executive officer, Christian Sewing.
Sewing defended the relationship, noting that Cerberus, as an advisor and owner privy to insider information, was bound by laws designed to prevent insider trading. Either party could exit the consultant contract with one month's notice, he said.
An exit from the contract in theory means Cerberus would have more leeway to increase or decrease its stake, which has lost more than 50% of its value since it was announced.
""Cerberus is very supportive of the developments taking place under"" Sewing, a spokesman for Cerberus said. ""We remain confident in his team's ability to execute on the restructuring plan to improve the bank's financial and operating performance."" 
As a Deutsche Bank shareholder, Cerberus had pushed for a merger with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), in which it has a 5% stake, people familiar with the matter have said. Those talks failed, and Deutsche Bank is now in the midst of a major revamp, cutting staff and shedding business. 
In addition to advice on cost cuts, Cerberus has advised the bank on how to generate more money from its liquidity reserves.

In 2018, Deutsche paid a single-digit million euro figure for the advice of a Cerberus team lead by former JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) executive Matt Zames, Sewing told shareholders at the annual general meeting. The bank had expected to pay the same in 2019, he said.

Overseas shipments from e-commerce purchases jumped to nearly 50 million packages so far in 2019, compared with 19.6 million packages last year and 6.1 million the year before, with most of the goods coming from China, customs data showed.
""This is to protect firms who've been producing goods that are often traded in e-commerce, such as sandals, crafts, and handbags,"" said customs director general Heru Pambudi.
Under the new regulations, which will come into effect at the end of January 2020, foreign-produced textiles, clothes, bags, and shoes that cost a minimum of $3 will be subject to a range of taxes with a total rate of 32.5% to 50% of their value, the official said.
For other products, the import taxes will be lowered from 27.5%-37.5% of their value to 17.5%, as applicable to any goods worth $3.
Goods worth below $3 will still be subject to some taxes, such as value-added tax, though the range would be lower, something that was not required before.
Pambudi told reporters this was in response to the demands of the general public and businesses, and will allow domestic goods to go ""head to head"" with foreign ones."

The stock rose 10.88% to 3.26 levs at 0847 GMT after opening at 2.94 levs.
Bulgaria's fourth-largest bank needs to increase its capital buffers after an ECB assessment of six banks found a capital shortfall at Fibank of 262.9 million euros ($291.37 million).
Fibank plans to offer 40 million new shares at 5 levs per share. It would consider the issue a success if as few as 4 million shares were sold at the offer price. The ECB also found a capital shortfall of 51.8 million euros at a smaller bank, Investbank.
Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, hopes to adopt the euro on Jan. 1 2023.
Fibank, which has already secured 130 million euros in additional capital, said it had also privately placed a 30 million-euro bond and offloaded bad loans with a nominal value of about 538 million levs.

1191,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 23, 2019 05:11AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Bayer, NMC Rouse Themselves Above the Holiday Torpor","Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were happy to drift into the holiday season on Monday, largely shrugging off news over the weekend that China would cut tariffs on hundreds of kinds of imported goods in what analysts saw as a preliminary to signing a preliminary trade deal with the U.S. in the New Year.
By 5:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was unchanged at 418.46, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.2% and the German DAX was down 0.2%. Most other bourses were also held in tight ranges.
News that the Chinese tariff cuts included semiconductors did little even to support the prices of European chipmakers, with both Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) dipping slightly and ASML (AS:ASML) eking out a gain of only 0.3%.
Among the rare exceptions to the torpor were German chemicals giant Bayer (DE:BAYGN), which rose as much as 3.5% after the U.S. government said a landmark-setting court fine against it for damages caused by its Roundup weedkiller should be reversed.
The Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department said in a ‘friend of the court’ brief on Friday that a federal appeals court should reverse a lower court verdict that ordered Bayer (DE:BAYGN) to pay $25 million to a man who blamed his cancer on the weedkiller made by   Monsanto   (NYSE:MON), which the German company bought in 2017.
An even bigger riser was UAE-focused hospital operator NMC Health (LON:NMC), which rose almost 20% after saying it will commission an independent review of its accounting in an effort to clear its name. The stock lost half its value last week after short seller Muddy Waters Research accused it of understating its debt, inflating its asset values and conducting unreported related-party transactions. NMC calls the allegations “baseless”.
Elsewhere,   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) AG continued to underperform after Switzerland’s financial regulator said on Friday it has appointed an investigator to look into what it said were multiple incidents of illegal surveillance.
The bank said on Monday that its chief executive Tidjane Thiam had no knowledge of a spying operation on its former HR director, which it blamed on the former chief operating officer who had also taken the rap for another spying operation on the group’s star wealth manager Iqbal Khan before he defected to rival UBS earlier this year."

Investors from outside of the Gulf were net buyers of about 3.56 billion Saudi riyals ($950 million) for the week ended Dec. 19, according to data provided by the stock exchange. Qualified foreign institutional investors (QFIs) boosted the figure and bought the most.
Index compiler MSCI Inc., which upgraded Saudi Arabia this year, added Aramco to its emerging-market index last week, spurring buying from passive funds. FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones also added the stock outside of regular reviews due to the size of the initial public offering. While foreigners balked at the IPO, citing what they deemed to be an expensive valuation among other concerns, managers tracking benchmarks passively had to purchase Aramco in order to comply with the index changes.
Still, the flows from abroad weren’t enough to sustain the stock price near a peak reached after the listing. Aramco fell 3.5% last week, erasing a third of the gains that followed the world’s biggest IPO. Investors from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi individuals and Saudi institutions, who were key for the IPO to happen, were net sellers last week, data from the exchange showed.
Investors should now see lower trading volume in Aramco compared with the very early days, said Marie Salem, the head of institutions at Daman Securities. “MSCI inclusion did not actually reflect the inflows that we and analysts were expecting. We should still see some sort of inflows that is going to come at a later stage from foreigners in particular.”"
1193,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 23, 2019 04:38AM ET</span>",Walls Closing In Around Ukrainian Iron Billionaire Zhevago,"(Bloomberg) -- If recent trends hold, Kostyantin Zhevago’s run as a billionaire is at risk of coming to an end. And that’s only the start of his troubles.
A deepening investigation into allegations of money laundering and embezzlement has forced the Ukrainian billionaire out of the leadership of his flagship company,  Ferrexpo  (LON:FXPO), and a court issued an arrest warrant for him this month.
As Zhevago fights the charges tied to his role in a defunct bank, the company itself -- one of the world’s most important iron ore pellet suppliers -- has lost more than $1.1 billion of equity value and now is worth about $1.2 billion. As a result, his own net worth has shrunk to $1.2 billion, down by about a third since the end of June. Zhevago denies all charges.
How his case plays out won’t just impact a key cog in the global supply chain -- Zhevago likes to say that Ferrexpo’s “molecules” help make everything from iPhones to Mercedes limousines. It’s also a landmark case for country under the leadership of a new president with little political experience, who built his brand around promises to battle corruption.
Seven months in, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s presidency has hit turbulent times. He was caught up in Donald Trump’s impeachment proceedings and his honeymoon with voters is over. His popularity took a hit partly as a result of a compromise in talks with Russia, though it rebounded after a new set of agreements this month. The former comedian is also facing questions about his ties to another oligarch, Igor Kolomoisky, and his commitment to fight corruption.
“There were a lot of lenders in Ukraine shut down because of various schemes and so far none of the owners have been punished,” said Konstantin Fastovets, an analyst at Kyiv-based investment firm Adamant Capital. “Zhevago may be the first. If this also happens to other stakeholders of failed lenders, it will signal that the new president was serious in his intentions to fight corruption and curb the power of oligarchs.”
Zelenskiy and Kolomoisky have repeatedly said there’s nothing untoward in their relationship, which started when the tycoon used his broadcasting empire to drive Zelenskiy’s former career as a TV comic.
A top prosecutor last month said the country is stepping up probes of failed lenders, partly as a response to international pressure. Authorities are “examining the embezzlement of funds by owners or management of all bankrupt and nationalized banks, without exception,” First Deputy Prosecutor General Vitaliy Kasko said in an interview.
The indictment and arrest warrant are a turnaround for the man who was once the fastest-rising star in Ukrainian business and, at one point, the country’s youngest billionaire. Zhevago, 45, stood out among Ukrainian oligarchs, partly because he’s younger than most of the cadre of tycoons that first emerged from the rubble of communism, and partly because he was one of the few who opted for a London stock offering and faced the increased scrutiny that entails.
Zhevago and his legal representatives repeatedly declined to comment for this story. Ferrexpo’s communications office stressed that the billionaire has stepped down as chief executive officer, even if he remains the majority shareholder, and the investigations are unrelated to the company.
In public, the billionaire has rejected suggestions that he acted improperly. At a campaign event in July, Zhevago responded when asked by Bloomberg about an audit at Ferrexpo that “this is provocation from your side.”
“Everything you say is just a lie,” he said. At a function in May, Zhevago said that the investigation meant nothing because the authorities were looking into almost all of the country’s charitable foundations.
Ferrexpo is “in a financially strong position and able to grow in a sustainable manner,” the company said in an emailed statement. It “continues to operate successfully and to deliver high-grade iron ore pellets to its world-class customers.“
His unique skill set, a sharp mind and an ability at self marketing have made Zhevago a key part of Ukraine’s corporate landscape, ever since he stepped into the whirlwind of post-Soviet business as a teenager. He quickly found inefficiencies to exploit in an economy ravaged by runaway inflation and market imbalances that left companies constantly short of cash.
“Zhevago is an impressive entrepreneur, with a strong work ethic,” said Vitaliy Lisovenko, a non-executive board member at Ferrexpo. “He is very analytical and strategic in his outlook. At Ferrexpo, his strategy at the outset was to win the world’s best steel producers as clients. Now this target has been reached.”
Zhevago always seemed to have a solution where few others did: he was able to raise financing in dollars from international partners when Ukraine’s currency was becoming worthless, he could navigate the bureaucracy when others got stuck, he was able to find funding when cash flows dried up. By age 22, Zhevago and his partners had bought a bank, Finance & Credit, just in time as the government started to dismantle the communist-era centralized economy.
In the furious dealmaking that followed, there was money to be made for a quick and agile mind like Zhevago. He acted as idea man for one of the richest Ukrainians of the era, gas magnate Ihor Bakai, who fled to Russia after Ukraine’s 2004 Orange Revolution. At times, he was the English-speaking and western-compatible local guide for big-name foreign investors from Merrill Lynch to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
‘Unique Skill’
“He had a unique skill to persuade, to sell ideas,” said Ihor Voronov, who hired Zhevago in early 1990s for an investment wing of his business as a freshman in college.
And he also made deals for himself. Zhevago and his partners bought breweries and cement plants, drugmakers and tobacco factories -- some they later sold to foreign investors and some they kept. In 1996, he acquired his crown jewel: an iron ore mine in the Poltava region.
Not that it looked like much of a jewel, at the time. The company was deeply indebted, months behind on wages and utility bills. But with Zhevago’s access to financing, the arrears were quickly cleared and he embarked on his life’s work: creating Ferrexpo.
By 2007, the company had been transformed to a modern iron conglomerate that today is the world’s third-biggest exporter of iron-ore pellets. Zhevago raised $500 million by selling 12% of Ferrexpo’s shares in London which valued the company at $1.67 billion and made him a billionaire at age 33. His current net worth is $1.1 billion, according to Bloomberg estimates.
“The chemical composition of Ferrexpo’s iron ore allows the company to be the supplier of choice for steelmakers which produce high quality steels for value added products,” said Alexander Martynenko, head of corporate research at a Kyiv-based investment firm ICU. Since 2007, Ferrexpo has increased total production volumes by 17% to 10.6 million tons and high-quality pellet output by 167% to 9.8 million tons, Martynenko estimates.
Everything seemed to be going right for Zhevago. He was elected to a seat in parliament, which gave him political influence. Even his soccer team, Vorskla Poltava, became a fixture in European competitions in the following decade, playing host to powerhouses like Benfica and Arsenal.
But as it tends to in Ukraine, the political landscape shifted under Zhevago’s feet. And when it did, it was an earthquake on a global scale. In 2014, anti-government protesters ousted the country’s pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych. Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and a deadly conflict followed between the central government and separatists in the country’s industrialized east. The economy went into a downward spiral.
By 2015, Finance & Credit was declared insolvent. The central bank found that almost 60% of the lender’s loans were extended to various parts of Zhevago’s business empire. When payments faltered -- Vorskla players even complained publicly about missed paychecks -- the lender itself was soon to follow.
The damage was extensive and investigations are still ongoing, with several of the bank’s former managers indicted. The charge against them is the embezzlement of about $100 million of mostly client money.
“It was a problem of all Ukrainian oligarchs, who owned banks,” Kateryna Rozhkova, the central bank’s first deputy governor, said in an interview. “They have assets in various industries and used their own lenders as an instrument for financing rather than a separate business.”
With his key financial asset taken off the board, the difficulties multiplied for Zhevago’s businesses and it all had an effect on the centerpiece of his empire, Ferrexpo. Prosecutors announced a money-laundering probe in April, saying they were looking into whether a charity called Blooming Land, Ferrexpo’s charity partner, was actually a vehicle used to evade taxes and hide illicit funds.
That investigation, still underway, doesn’t personally involve Zhevago. His most important asset still got caught up in the proceedings when Ferrexpo’s Poltava plant was searched by investigators in August as part of the probe. The company at the time said was a “routine request for documents on different third parties.”
Zhevago’s decision to leave his post as chief executive was “entirely typical” and intended to “avoid any damage to the business,” according to Lisovenko, the Ferrexpo board member.
The stock went into a tailspin as Ferrexpo’s auditor Deloitte LLP and two directors abruptly resigned because of disagreements over an internal probe into Blooming Land.
Zhevago was dealt another blow in July when he lost his parliamentary seat to an unfavored challenger as Ukraine’s political revolution propelled his 25-year-old opponent affiliated with Zelenskiy to victory.
Ferrexpo fell 39% in two months after the company said at the end of August that an independent review suggested some of its charitable donations may have been misappropriated. The probe also found that the company and its biggest shareholder weren’t connected to any possible wrongdoing. The stock has recovered more than 15% since hitting its lowest value in almost three years in late October.
During the campaign event back in July, Zhevago brushed off a question about the plunge in the share price, which is now down 27% this year, the sixth-worst performance of the 25 companies included in the FTSE All-Share Basic Materials Index, which has gained 3.8%.
“The shares fell after some representatives from the audit committee made absurd statements saying nonsense,” Zhevago responded."

Ten-year Treasury yields edged lower.
The Stoxx Europe 600 index retreated from Friday’s record-high close, with a modest decline led by telecom shares and carmakers. Contracts on the S&P 500 were little changed after the underlying index logged its biggest weekly gain since September. Chinese shares dropped after a state-backed fund said it would pare its stakes in some tech companies. Equities had modest losses in Tokyo, and were little changed in Hong Kong and Seoul. The dollar slipped against a basket of major peers.
Major asset classes are collectively on track for the best returns in a decade in 2019 after central banks around the world eased monetary policy. Trade tensions also eased ahead of the year end, calming investors’ nerves. China cut import tariffs on a wide range of goods including food, consumer items and smart-phone parts, continuing Beijing’s drive to lower trade barriers and spur domestic demand. The signing of the first-phase of the U.S.-China trade deal is set for January.
“There is justification to say that the fundamentals are turning, but we haven’t seen confirmation in prices or data yet,” Kyle Rodda, an analyst at IG Markets Ltd., said on Bloomberg TV. “The risk is skewed to the upside, but I still think it’s a tentative picture at the moment.”
The pound is straddling $1.30 after seeing its worst week in more than two years. It remains on the back foot after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson renewed hard-Brexit fears with an accelerated schedule for signing a trade deal with the European Union.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The logistics unit of Chinese e-commerce company JD.com Inc (O:JD) has held early discussions with banks about a potential overseas IPO that could raise $8 billion to $10 billion, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
JD Logistics is targeting a valuation of at least $30 billion, according to the people, who declined to be named as the information is confidential.
The unit is expected to select banks for the initial public offering (IPO) in the second quarter of next year and will use the funds for warehouse expansion and potential acquisition purposes, one person said.
The float could take place in the second half of 2020, the people said.
JD.com, the second-largest Chinese e-commerce company after  Alibaba  (N:BABA), declined to comment.
The listing could happen in Hong Kong or New York, although a timetable and venue have not been finalised and the numbers are subject to changes, the people said.
JD.com spun off its logistics unit into a standalone entity in 2017, and then opened up the latter's delivery and warehousing services to third-party companies.
In 2018, the division raised $2.5 billion in a funding round from investors including Hillhouse Capital Group, Sequoia Capital China, China Merchants Group, Tencent Holdings (HK:0700), and China Life Insurance (SS:601628).
The company's valuation reached about $13.5 billion after the fundraising.
As of Sept. 30, JD Logistics operated more than 650 warehouses, which covered an aggregate gross floor area of approximately 16 million square meters.
The company is among the top players in China in terms of warehousing space."

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) on Monday cleared CEO Tidjane Thiam and other top executives from knowledge of a second spying incident, saying former Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee had the Swiss bank's then-head of human resources followed in February and covered it up.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank confirmed it was behind the second internal spying scandal to surface this year after a newspaper report last week detailed former HR head Peter Goerke's tailing. 
The matter comes as an embarrassment to Credit Suisse after an earlier probe into spying on wealth management executive Iqbal Khan depicted the incident as a one-off. 
""The observation of Peter Goerke, which has now been confirmed, is inexcusable,"" Chairman Urs Rohner said in a statement, noting ""grave concern"" that those responsible for the tailing had not mentioned it during the earlier probe.
""We are aware that the observations of Iqbal Khan and Peter Goerke have damaged the reputation of our bank,"" he said.
An investigation by law firm Homburger into spying on Khan -- which became public in September after the departing executive confronted a private detective pursuing him and his wife through Zurich, triggering a criminal probe -- found Bouee and the security boss under him were alone responsible for the order and found no evidence of other cases. 
Both resigned, and now Bouee has been sacked.

The latest probe, also conducted by Homburger, determined Bouee had lied when asked about any other surveillance orders and had taken care not to leave any identifiable traces in the bank's systems.

A memorandum of understanding has been announced internally within BlackRock (N:BLK) and CCB (SS:601939) (HK:0939), according to the people and an internal notice seen by Reuters.
The deal comes as China's government continues to open up its financial industry to foreign firms. On Friday, French asset manager  Amundi SA  (PA:AMUN) said it had won approval to establish a majority-owned wealth management venture with a unit of Bank of China Ltd (SS:601988) (HK:3988).
Chinese banks' wealth management subsidiaries have broad business capacity including launching publicly-offered products, so they are attractive to international asset managers, said Yin Ge, partner at Han Kun Law Offices in Shanghai. 
Forming wealth management ventures would also allow foreign asset managers to leverage Chinese banks' distribution network, and ""we have received increasing inquiries on this option,"" Ge said. 
BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, and Temasek will own the majority of the new venture due to ownership restrictions of wealth management units by Chinese banks, the people said.
CCB, China's second-largest bank by assets after Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (SS:601398) (HK:1398), set up a wholly owned wealth management unit this year and so cannot control another wealth management firm, the people said.
The state-backed bank has also launched a strategic partnership with BlackRock regarding investment, asset management, risk management and financial technologies, the internal notice showed.
CCB and Temasek did not respond to requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment.
ANOTHER OPTION 
China has allowed foreign asset managers to set up private fund businesses, and next plans to scrap ownership rules on mutual fund businesses in April. Wealth management ventures offer another option for money managers to enter the country with controlling stakes.
Other ""leading and capable"" foreign asset management firms are also in talks with Chinese banks to set up wealth management joint ventures, said Wang Daqing, large bank department chief at the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC).
""Foreign investors have long required greater access to China's market, so we expanded that access for them first,"" a CBIRC regulator overseeing the wealth management industry told Reuters.
""They now have more options when choosing to enter the market, whether it's a private fund manager or an asset management JV,"" the person said.
Market reaction has nevertheless been mixed. For some leading Chinese banks, setting up a wealth management firm controlled by foreign investors has limited benefits.
""The asset under management and investment power of the JV won't be reflected on the book of our bank,"" said the head of wealth management company of a mid-sized Chinese bank. ""Plus it's capital consuming for us to set up another arm.""
Under current regulation, a wealth management company must have no less than 1 billion yuan ($143 million) registered capital.
Efforts for such JVs risk descending into a simple political gesture if Chinese banks cannot leverage investment capabilities from the foreign investors, the person said.

UAE-focused hospital operator NMC Health (LON:NMC) said it has commissioned an independent review by external auditors to examine the allegations made last week by short seller Muddy Waters Research.
NMC’s shares lost half their value last week after Muddy Waters, owned by Carson Block, accused it of inflating its asset values, understating its debt and making undeclared related-party transactions.
Despite publishing a detailed rebuttal, NMC’s shares fell 15% on Friday alone after the Financial Times said it had held talks to raise off-balance sheet debt, a charge that indirectly supported one of Block’s allegations.
NMC said in its statement on Monday that it is “disappointed with the very material and, we believe, unwarranted share price reaction.”

BHP Group (LON:BHPB) said Andrew Mackenzie will leave the group at the end of March, three months earlier than scheduled.
Mackenzie is passing the reins as CEO to Mike Henry as of January 1, and the mining group said it’s confident the transition is “proceeding well and ahead of schedule.”
Mackenzie will receive around 7% less in stock under the company's long-term incentive program as a result.

GlaxoSmithKline (LON:GSK) confirmed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had refused to approve the long-acting HIV treatment made by its majority-owned subsidiary ViiV Healthcare.
 “The reasons given in the Complete Response Letter relate to Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC),” GSK said. “There have been no reported safety issues related to CMC and there is no change to the safety profile of the products used in clinical trials to date. ViiV Healthcare will work closely with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps for this New Drug Application.”
Reuters had originally reported the FDA’s rejection on Sunday.

Roche will make an upfront payment of $750 million in cash and $400 million worth in equity at closing for Sarepta's investigational micro-dystrophin gene therapy SRP-9001 that is currently in clinical development, the Swiss drugmaker said in a statement on Monday.
In addition, Sarepta is eligible to receive up to $1.7 billion in regulatory and sales milestones, plus royalties on net sales, Roche said, adding the agreement was expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.
Sarepta will continue to be responsible for the clinical development and manufacturing of SRP-9001 while sharing global clinical development costs equally with Roche.
DMD is a rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder, affecting about one in 3,500-5,000 male births worldwide and causing severe progressive muscle loss and premature death, Roche said.

Earlier this month, Sarepta gained U.S. approval for another DMD drug, Vyondys 53.

1206,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 22, 2019 10:43PM ET</span>","Vietnam-linked Hacking Group Targets Toyota, Other Companies","(Bloomberg) -- A Vietnam-based hacking group is learning from China’s playbook, using increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks to spy on competitors and help Vietnam catch up to global competitors, according to cybersecurity experts.
In the last two years, the group, which is believed to be tied to the Vietnamese government and known as APT32, has ramped up its cyber-espionage, particularly in southeast Asia, according to the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Inc. The hacking group’s exploits have included intellectual property theft, the firm said, the same activity for which Chinese hackers are infamous.
The automotive industry has been a key target for APT32, according to multiple experts. For example, APT32 created fake domains for Toyota Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. in an attempt to infiltrate the automakers’ networks, according to a researcher familiar with the matter who requested anonymity discussing companies. In March, Toyota discovered that it was targeted in Vietnam and Thailand and through a subsidiary -- Toyota Tokyo Sales Holdings Inc -- in Japan, according to spokesman Brian Lyons. A Toyota official, who requested anonymity discussing the hacking group, confirmed that APT32 was responsible.
Vietnam has also targeted American businesses relevant to Vietnam’s economy, including the consumer products industry, for years, according to experts. “What’s changed more recently, and this is consistent with broader trends in the cyberthreat actor landscape, is that they are getting better and better at it,” said Andrew Grotto, a fellow at Stanford University who served as the senior director for cybersecurity policy on the National Security Council from late 2015 to mid-2017. “They’re becoming more adept at developing their own tools, while at the same time tapping the global malware market for commercial tools.”
The uptick in Vietnam’s economic espionage activity, which began in 2012 and has spiked since 2018 according to CrowdStrike, comes as the Trump administration seeks to curb what many believe has been rampant intellectual property theft by China -- former National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander, who served under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, has called it the “greatest transfer of wealth in history.”
Competitive Edge
The Vietnamese hackers have emulated some of China’s cyber methods, albeit on a significantly smaller scale, the experts said.
Vietnamese government hackers have likely “seen how successful the Chinese have been at building cyber-espionage capabilities and cybersurveillance capabilities” according to Eric Rosenbach, co-director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School and a former assistant secretary of defense for global security under Obama. As a result, they may be building out or purchasing their own capabilities “either for economic interests or outright theft of intellectual property,” he said.
The Vietnamese foreign ministry and Vietnamese embassy in Washington didn’t respond to requests for comment. A government spokeswoman previously said allegations that state-aligned hackers targeted foreign carmakers were “unfounded.” A representative for the U.S. State Department declined to comment on allegations about economic espionage by Vietnam.
A Hyundai representative didn’t comment on whether it had been targeted by the Vietnamese hacking group, but said that the company “promptly detects and responds to the events of its IT securities.”
Vietnam is part of a growing group of countries -- outside of major cyberplayers such as Russia and China -- that are developing and buying cyber capabilities, according former government officials.
“One of the trends that we tracked when I was in the White House was both the broadening of the number of countries that had active cyber programs,” said Michael Daniel, who served as the cybersecurity coordinator on the National Security Council under Obama and is now president and chief executive officer of the non-profit group Cyber Threat Alliance. “The ones that have been investing in cyber like Vietnam are continuing to grow in capability.”
Cybersecurity experts offered different, and sometimes conflicting, reasons to explain the hacking group’s activities, from stealing intellectual property to improve Vietnamese products to gaining a competitive edge in negotiations to ensuring foreign corporations are complying with national regulations.
Ocean Lotus
The cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. has been tracking APT32 -- which is also known as Ocean Lotus and Ocean Buffalo -- since 2012, according to Nick Carr, a director at the firm. In 2017, his team investigated a series of hacks in the U.S., Germany and multiple countries in Asia and found that the group had spent at least three years targeting foreign governments, journalists, dissidents and “foreign corporations with a vested interest in Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer products and hospitality sectors.”
“APT32 leverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware, in conjunction with commercially-available tools, to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with Vietnamese state interests,” FireEye reported.
Ongoing tactics by APT32 appear to include registering domains that resemble car companies -- a move which can precede phishing attacks, in which credentials are stolen by hackers in order to access internal networks, said John Hultquist, FireEye’s director of intelligence analysis.
“Most recently, we’ve seen suspected APT32 domain registration activity designed to resemble automotive firms,” Hultquist said. “This ongoing registration activity affirms APT32’s continuing interest in foreign automakers doing business in Vietnam.”
APT32 recently used Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to target individuals who are active in Vietnamese politics, according to the Slovakia-based cybersecurity firm Eset. In this attack, APT32 hackers sent Facebook messages, or Facebook pages, containing what appeared to be a photo album. When victims scrolled through the album, one of the many photos was in fact a malicious document that installed malware on the computer, said Marc-Etienne M.Léveillé, a researcher at the firm.
Targeting dissidents has been part of a broad surveillance campaign that has included hacking into websites popular with politically active citizens and then using those sites to track them and collect information, said Steven Adair, founder of the cybersecurity firm Volexity, Inc. APT32 conducted “a very sophisticated and extremely widespread mass digital surveillance and attack campaign” targeting Asian countries, the media, groups associated with human rights and civil society as well as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Volexity reported.
Mini-China Story
While Vietnamese hacking of corporations appears to be on the rise, FireEye has seen a major decline in China’s IP theft against corporations -- even as the U.S. trade talks with China have emphasized negotiating an end to it. “From China’s perspective, we’ve definitely seen a massive drop off of that,” said Hultquist of FireEye.
But Vietnam is at a significantly earlier stage in development and, like China did years ago, has turned to cyber-espionage as a means of becoming more competitive, said Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s vice president of intelligence. “This is kind of like a mini-China story,” he said."
1207,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 22, 2019 10:26PM ET</span>","China’s state semiconductor fund unveils plans to divest, weighs on tech stocks","Investing.com – Chinese tech stocks dived on Monday morning in Asia following the news that the country’s state semiconductor fund will reduce stakes in the tech companies.
Shenzhen Goodix Technology’s stock price fell 4.5%, while stock prices of Hunan Goke Microelectronics plunged 9.51% and Gigadevice Semiconductor dropped 7.01%.
Known as the “Big Fund”, the National Integrated Circuitry Investment Fund planned to partially divest in these tech companies by no more than one percentage point each.
These three companies are prominent players in China’s semiconductor industry. The state fund currently holds 15.63% in Goke, 6.63% in Goodix, and 9.72% in Gigadevice.
The move came after the three companies made great gains this year. Goke, Goodix and Gigadevice’s stock prices have surged 93%, 161% and 214% this year.

China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.83% by 09:07 PM ET (02:07 GMT). The Shenzhen Component was down 0.41%. 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.31%.

China´s finance ministry announced early Monday morning plans to cut tariffs on more than 850 products such as pork and other agricultural commodities.

Beijing’s announcement follows a Friday tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump, in which he remarked on the good momentum of the Sino-U.S. trade talks, saying he had “a very good talk” with Chinese President Xi Jinping and noting that “formal signing is being arranged”.
On Monday, the Tariff Commission of China’s State Council said reducing tariffs would be “conducive to reducing import costs, promoting the orderly and free flow of international and domestic factors, and promoting the establishment of a new system of a higher level, open economy.”
Putting a drag on some Chinese tech stocks, however, the National Integrated Circuitry Investment Fund, known as the “Big Fund”, said it will partially divest from its investments in Shenzhen Goodix Technology, Hunan Goke Microelectronics and Gigadevice Semiconductor after big gains this year.

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2019 07:42PM ET</span>",Lone Star emerges as white-knight bidder for Japanese hotel chain Unizo,"By Junko Fujita
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese hotel chain Unizo Holdings (T:3258) said on Sunday it had received a friendly buyout offer from U.S. investment fund Lone Star, a deal that could end a five-month takeover battle involving Blackstone Group (N:BX), Fortress Investment Group and activist investor Elliott Management. 
Lone Star will launch a tender offer to buy Unizo on Tuesday at 5,100 yen ($46.60) per share, valuing it at 175.4 billion yen, Unizo said, topping the 5,000 yen that Blackstone was planning to offer. Its shares closed on Friday at 4,900 yen.
The scheme would allow a group of Unizo employees to own a 73% stake in Unizo's common shares, while Lone Star would take a 27% stake, the company said.
However, Lone Star would buy 45 billion yen worth of preferred shares in Unizo as well as providing 130 billion yen in loans to Unizo. That would eventually allow Lone Star to exercise the right to control 99.99% of Unizo's voting rights indirectly, Unizo said.
Unizo shares were trading up 4.9% at 5,140 yen early on Monday, after rising as much as 6.1%.
Unizo said Lone Star was not seeking to control Unizo so it was unlikely that Lone Star would exercise that right. 
The deal, if successful, would be the first high-profile transaction in Japan by Dallas-based Lone Star since it was one of the most active funds in the country after the collapse of the asset inflated bubble economy there in the early 1990s. 
Lone Star back then was known as a distressed investor, buying for example a failed bank, struggling golf courses and hotels on the cheap. It turned them around quickly, selling them on or listing them on the public market for a profit. 
Unizo was little known until it became a target of a hostile bid from Japanese travel agent H.I.S. Co (T:9603) in July. The company at one stage turned to SoftBank Group-owned (T:9984) Fortress to fend off the bid, but later withdrew its support for the white-knight offer.
Fortress is currently running a tender offer to buy Unizo for 4,100 yen per share.
In October Blackstone emerged as a potential bidder offering 5,000 yen per share, but it has not launched a bid. 
Unizo said it would oppose Fortress's bid and would end talks with Blackstone. 
Unizo had been fighting off both suitors in a way that has made it a test case for the Japanese government's efforts to attract foreign investors via improved corporate governance. 
Unizo asked both Fortress and Blackstone for control of how any potential owner would exit its investment through an entity to be created by a group of non-executive employees.
U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management, which became Unizo's largest shareholder with a 13.14% stake, has voiced concern that Unizo was trying to drive away suitors and suggested that management members were seeking to preserve their jobs. 

Unizo said if the transaction is successful, all board members and other executives, including Chief Executive Tetsuji Kosaki, would resign.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2019 05:59PM ET</span>",Activist hedge fund Marcato Capital to shut down after drop in assets,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Marcato Capital Management, backed by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group and billionaire William Ackman, is shutting down as assets have shriveled after two years of poor returns, sources said on Sunday.
Richard McGuire, the firm's founder and portfolio manager, began telling investors of his decision to return outside capital late last week, and expects to send the money back quickly because the portfolio is now largely in cash, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
McGuire had been selling positions over the last months to meet redemption requests.
A spokesman for Marcato declined to comment on Sunday.
The decision marks the end of a nine-year run for one of the hedge fund industry's most celebrated newcomers who launched in 2010 with the backing of Blackstone Group, the world's biggest hedge fund investor, and Ackman, his former boss at Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management. McGuire was the first former partner to leave Ackman, followed by Scott Ferguson, Roy Katzovicz and Paul Hilal, who have all set up their own firms.
McGuire over the years pressed companies ranging from DineEquity, now Dine Brands Global, which runs fast food restaurant Applebees, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), auction house Sotheby's, to footwear company Deckers Outdoor Corp for changes and won a fiercely contested proxy contest at Buffalo Wild Wings. 
At its peak, Marcato managed roughly $3 billion in assets, but assets have now shriveled to a few hundred million, one of the sources said.
Returns tumbled late last year, leaving the fund with a sizable loss for 2018, an investor said. This year, while strong at the start, will also end in the red after some of the firm's investments that are vulnerable to the effects of the U.S.-China trade war, like Terex Corp, took a hit.
From its launch through September 2018, Marcato International returned an average 10.7% a year, roughly double the 5.5% gain posted by its HFRI Event Driven: Special Situations Index.
Shrinking assets, while uncomfortable for all investors, are especially problematic for activist investors that push management to make changes ranging from buying back shares to selling off divisions to refreshing their boards.
An activist fund's agreements with target companies often include pledges to keep a certain amount of money in the stock, something that can become difficult when clients demand their money back from the activist fund.
McGuire expects to keep managing his own capital and could in the future partner with others on investments, one of the sources said.
Raising new capital for activist funds has been tough since late 2015 when investors began worrying more about the prospects of a recession when long-biased activist funds often fare poorly. This year has been a winner for many activist funds as strong gains in the markets, specifically in the software and consumer sectors, have buoyed many portfolios including Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, which has gained more than 50% this year.

But hundreds of hedge funds have also shuttered their doors this year. Hedge Fund Research reported that 540 funds shut in the first three quarters of 2019, while only 391 funds have launched during that time. In 2018, a total of 659 funds shut down, according to HFR data.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2019 01:46PM ET</span>",Ex-chairman of Popolare di Bari investigated for alleged corruption: source,"ROME (Reuters) - Prosecutors in the southern Italian town of Bari are investigating the former chairman of Popolare di Bari for alleged corruption in relation to the central bank's supervisory activity over the failing local lender, a judicial source said on Sunday.
Earlier this month Italy's government approved an emergency decree granting a lifeline of up to 900 million euros ($997 million) to the unlisted cooperative bank, in the latest state bailout of an ailing lender.
Prosecutors began an investigation into the bank three years ago, and the lines of inquiry now involve 10 people, including the bank's former chairman, Marco Jacobini, the source said.
The source said Jacobini was being investigated as part of a probe into Popolare di Bari's relations with industry supervisors for allegedly corrupting a public official.
Neither the identity of the official nor that of the institution the person belonged to have been disclosed.
A lawyer for Jacobini declined to comment.
Like other regional banks, Popolare di Bari never recovered from Italy's worst post-war recession earlier this decade, which bankrupted thousands of businesses and saddled lenders with a mountain of unpaid loans.
The latest crisis also calls into question the efficacy of the Bank of Italy's supervisory role, with the ruling 5-Star Movement calling for a reform of the appointment procedure of the central bank's top management.
Critics say a key factor in the crisis at Popolare di Bari's was its 2014 acquisition of troubled rival Tercas. The takeover was authorized by the central bank but further weakened Pop Bari by increasing its bad loan burden.
Prosecutors are also probing Popolare di Bari's lending practices and the acquisition of Tercas.
A Bank of Italy spokeswoman said that the central bank was cooperating with prosecutors, but it had no information about the investigation concerning Jacobini.
Jacobini stepped down as Popolare di Bari's chairman in July after three decades at the helm of the biggest bank in Italy's disadvantaged south. His family was among founders of the bank in the 1960s and has since kept a tight grip on it.

The 7:58 a.m. ET (1258 GMT) landing in New Mexico's White Sands desert capped a turbulent 48 hours for Boeing's botched milestone test of an astronaut capsule that is designed to help NASA regain its human spaceflight capabilities.
The landing will yield the mission's most valuable test data after failing to meet its core objective of docking to the space station. 

Starliner's three main parachutes deployed just over one mile (1,600 meters) from the Earth's surface after enduring intense heat from the violent reentry through the atmosphere, plummeting at 25 times the speed of sound.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2019 06:40AM ET</span>",Second Credit Suisse spying probe expected to clear CEO Thiam: SonntagsZeitung,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - A second probe into staff surveillance at  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is set to clear Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam, Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung reported on Sunday.
Credit Suisse last week said it had initiated an investigation after a Swiss newspaper reported that its former head of human resources, Peter Goerke, was followed by private detectives in February.
That revived concerns about the bank's practices after the tailing of wealth management star Iqbal Khan in September led to a scandal and upheaval in Credit Suisse's highest ranks.
An investigation ordered by the bank had concluded the surveillance on Khan -- now employed by UBS (S:UBSG) -- was a one-off, organized by then-Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee and the security boss under him, both of whom resigned.
But law firm Homburger, which conducted the investigation, said deleted messages on a secure messaging platform used by Bouee and security personnel had limited the scope of the findings.
Credit Suisse said on Friday the new inquiry was nearing completion, with results to be published on Monday.
SonntagsZeitung, citing unnamed sources, reported on Sunday that the investigation, also conducted by Homburger, had substantiated the claims surrounding Goerke but had so far found no evidence of further instances of shadowing, nor that CEO Thiam knew private detectives had been hired to tail the two executives.
The investigation is continuing, with only interim findings to be communicated on Dec. 23, the paper reported.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on the contents of the SonntagsZeitung article. A spokesman said the bank would communicate on Monday as previously announced.
Finance watchdog FINMA is also examining the issue of staff surveillance at Credit Suisse and on Friday appointed an independent auditor to clarify relevant corporate governance questions.
A criminal investigation into Khan's tailing -- which came to a head when the wealth manager filed a police report following a confrontation with one of the detectives as he and his wife drove through Zurich -- is ongoing."

Oil storage company BPGIC completed the merger on Friday, it said in a statement on Sunday, and its valuation now exceeds $1 billion.
The merger and listing were aimed at establishing a global presence with access to liquid markets that could support the company's expansion plans, BPGIC said.
BPGIC, which was set up in 2013, is one of the largest holders of oil storage assets in Fujairah.
In September, BPGIC awarded a contract to Spain's SENER engineering group to build an oil refinery in Fujairah, located just outside the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping lane.
The plant will produce bunker fuel that complies with new international laws capping sulfur content in shipping fuels."
1219,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2019 01:51AM ET</span>",The best year financial markets have ever had?,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - For all the angst about trade wars, geopolitics and a sputtering and overly indebted global economy, 2019 might just be the best year investors have ever had. 
The numbers are staggering. Global stocks have piled on more than $10 trillion, bonds have been on fire, oil has surged almost 25%, former crisis spots Greece and Ukraine have top-performed, and even gold has sparkled.
Wall Street (SPX) and MSCI's near 50-country world index (MIWD00000PUS) have both stormed to record highs after 30% and 24% leaps. Europe, Japan, China and Brazil are all up at least 20% in dollar terms too. Not exactly shoddy. 
A mirror image of 2018, when almost everything fell? Perhaps. But there have been a couple of important drivers.
One was China showing it was serious about stimulus for its $14 trillion economy. The other was the screeching change of direction by the world's top central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, which cut U.S. interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis more than a decade earlier.
""Whereas a year ago the Fed was raising rates and earnings were rolling over, this year you have felt the Fed has been on your side,"" said James Clunie, who manages asset firm Jupiter's Absolute Return Fund. 
""They are willing to do QE4 at a stock market (record) high, which is extraordinary,"" he added, referring to Fed efforts to bring down a spike in money market rates that some suggest could presage a fourth round of quantitative easing asset purchases.
Graphic: Global markets in 2019 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/103/103/Pasted%20Image.jpg
That Fed shift and the worldwide blizzard of rate cuts that have come since have fired bond markets up like a rocket.
U.S. Treasuries, the world's benchmark government IOU, have made a whopping 9.4 percent after yields plunged as much as 120 basis points. That followed a near 40 basis point fall the last quarter of 2018, after five quarters in which they had consistently risen. 
German Bunds -- Europe's safest asset -- have had their best year in five years, making roughly 5.5% in euro terms as the European Central Bank has reversed course too. The yield on 10-year debt dropped below zero percent for the first time since 2016 in March and dived as deep as -0.74% in September.
Graphic: U.S. Treasuries vs German Bunds - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/102/102/Pasted%20Image.jpg
In commodities, oil has raced up almost 25% following its best first quarter since 2009. That, plus key dividend rule changes, has made Russia's stock market the best in the world with a 40% rise and also made the rouble a top three currency.
Metals have had a more mixed time. Copper is only 4% higher after buckling badly when trade tensions flared in the middle of the year, and aluminum is down 2%. But palladium, used in car and truck catalytic converters, has boomed 55%, while gold has had its best year since 2010 with a 15% jump. 
A statistic likely to make most jaws drop is that Greek banks -- remember all that euro debt crisis and capital controls stuff a few years back? -- have been some of the world's best-performing stocks this year.
The country's biggest lender Piraeus Bank (AT:BOPr) is up 250%, as is smaller Attica Bank (AT:BOAr), helping make Athens Europe's strongest bourse this year.
But even those gains look skimpy in comparison to Californian video streaming darling Roko (O:ROKU), whose shares have risen 440% this year. 
FANGTASTIC
Tech has remained top more broadly. Apple (O:AAPL) may just have lost its crown as world's most valuable firm to  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) but it can console itself with its 77% leap this year.
Facebook (O:FB) has surged 57%, Microsoft (O:MSFT) 53%, Google (O:GOOGL) 30%, Netflix (O:NFLX) 24% and Amazon (O:AMZN) 19 percent. China's tech sector <.CSIINT> is right in mix too with a 64% rally and online behemoth  Alibaba  (K:BABA) up 53%. 
Cryptoassets have been typically wild. Bitcoin was up over up 260% in June but it has been hauled back to around 85%.
Riskier high-yield debt, corporate bonds and local currency emerging market bonds and have all brought in between 11%-14% while Ukraine's dollar bonds and Greece's euro bonds have piled on over 30%. 
""It is just a great year for the asset class,"" said Pictet emerging market debt portfolio manager Guido Chamorro.
""It has been a relentless rally across the board over the last couple of months and it is possible that it continues into next year.""

Despite almost daily Brexit chaos, the loss of another prime minister and a snap election, UK gilts have returned 4.5% and a near 6% rise could land sterling its best quarter since 2009.
In contrast, the Fed's pirouette and easing of trade tensions means the dollar index (DXY) is about to experience its worst quarter in 1-1/2 years. It is still clinging to a 1.5% gain for the year, though, meaning it will be the euro's (EUR=) fifth red year in six.
As usual the big swings have been in emerging markets. Argentina's peso  and Turkey's lira , 2018's punchbags, have taken another beating. Argentina's woes have worsened such that it is restructuring its debt again while Turkey's worries have not really gone away.
At the other end of the spectrum, a new president and a new reform agenda have seen Ukraine's hryvnia  rocket 19%. Russia's rouble is up 11% and Egypt's pound  is sandwiched in between with a 11.7% gain.

LIMA (Reuters) - The general manager of the company that operates McDonald's restaurants in Peru told local television that the beverage machine at the restaurant where two employees were fatally electrocuted last weekend had experienced an electrical fault but it was not reported to the company's maintenance department.
Relatives of the two employees who were killed and about 80 other people protested against McDonald's (N:MCD) in a suburb of Lima on Saturday afternoon.
""The information, unfortunately, that the machine was not working and giving people shocks was only known within the local managers and was not escalated so that immediate action could be taken,"" José Andrade, general manager of Arcos Dorados Peru (N:ARCO), which has the franchise for all the McDonald's restaurants in Peru, told Peruvian television station Canal N on Friday night. The two employees who were killed, Alexandra Porras, 18, and Carlos Gabriel Campo, 19, were electrocuted last Sunday in Pueblo Libre, a district of the capital, while cleaning the kitchen, police said.
On Saturday, protesters carried posters bearing the victims' photos and slogans reading: ""Justice for Alexa and Gabriel,"" who relatives said were a couple who had been working for the fast-food chain for several months. 
A lawyer acting for the victims´ relatives, Elizabeth Carmona, said she had asked the prosecution on Friday for McDonald’s and Arcos Dorados representatives in Peru to be detained.
""The evidence of the criminal experts has determined that a power leak caused the deaths,"" she said.
Rocío Zapata, Gabriel's mother, claimed that the restaurant did not offer proper training to its employees. ""Who is going to give back our children?"" she said.
Arcos Dorados, which owns and operates McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) restaurants throughout Latin America, said on Wednesday it had shut all 29 McDonald's Peru restaurants to conduct safety inspections. 
The company said that it paid “competitive” salaries, took seriously concerns raised about working conditions and that workers’ shifts never exceed eight hours.""What we have been able to determine through internal investigations is that at least 24 hours before this happened, it was known that the machine was presenting problems,"" Andrade said. ""What they ought to have done is to stop using the machine, even disconnect it. 
""This has hit us all very hard and we are working hard to review all our processes, all our protocols, to ensure such a thing does not happen again,"" he said.

A spokesman for Arcos Dorados did not immediately respond to the claims by its general manager.

1221,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2019 03:59PM ET</span>",U.S. government says verdict in Bayer's Roundup case should be reversed,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department said a federal appeals court should reverse a lower court verdict finding  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) liable in the case of a California man who blamed its Roundup weed killer for his cancer.
The government said in a friend of the court brief filed on Friday that glyphosate, the weed killer's active ingredient, is not a carcinogen and as a result a warning on the label was not required as California state law demands.
The backing by the EPA and Justice Department comes days after Bayer asked a U.S. federal appeals court to throw out a $25 million judgment it was ordered to pay Edwin Hardeman. Bayer had denied its Roundup weed killer causes cancer.
In April, the EPA reaffirmed that glyphosate does not cause cancer.
Farmers spray glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide in U.S. agriculture, on fields of soybeans and other crops that are genetically engineered to resist it. Roundup is also used by consumers on lawns, golf courses and elsewhere. 
Hardeman's lawyers previously accused Roundup maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which Bayer acquired last year in a $63 billion deal, of having failed to warn consumers about the herbicide's cancer risk. Bayer stock has lost about 23% in value since the first Roundup verdict for plaintiffs in August 2018. 
Bayer argued it would be impossible to comply with the Hardeman verdict, a lawsuit brought under state law, because any warning label would be in conflict with guidance from a federal agency. 

The EPA and Justice Department agreed in their Friday filing. ""It is unlawful for manufacturers and sellers to make claims on their labels that differ from what EPA approves,"" the U.S. government said.

Business minister Andrea Leadsom had put the deal on hold to review the sale of air-to-air refueling equipment maker Cobham, which employs 10,000 people and also makes communications equipment for military vehicles.
""I am satisfied that the undertakings mitigate the national security risks identified to an acceptable level and have therefore accepted them and cleared the merger to proceed,"" Leadsom said in a statement published on Friday.
Leadsom had said on Tuesday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new government of was minded to accept the deal after Advent put forward several legal undertakings, including having a number of British executives on Cobham's boards.
Advent will have to give prior notice to Britain's defense ministry if it plans to sell all or part of Cobham's business, and honor existing contracts with the government. 
A member of the family which founded Cobham said the decision was deeply disappointing. 
""In Cobham, we stand to lose yet another great British defense manufacturer to foreign ownership,"" said Nadine Cobham, whose late husband was a son of the company's founder.
""In one of its first major economic decisions, the government is not taking back control so much as handing it away,"" she said, adding that the announcement on the weekend before Christmas had been timed to avoid scrutiny.
Johnson said the sale showed Britain - which is due to leave the European Union at the end of next month - was open to investment from around the world.
""It's very important that we should have an open and dynamic market economy,"" he told British broadcasters during a visit to Estonia. ""A lot of checks have been gone through to make sure that, in that particular case, all the security issues that might be raised can be satisfied.""
Founded in the 1930s, Cobham's equipment came to the fore ahead of World War Two and in the 1982 Falklands conflict. Its technology is now used in aircraft such as Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the Eurofighter Typhoon, as well as advanced naval vessels, satellites and military vehicles.
However, it is still recovering from profit warnings in 2016 and 2017 that forced it to ask shareholders for cash and prompted Chief Executive David Lockwood to overhaul operations.
Advent has already won approval from regulators in the European Union, United States and Finland for its acquisition of Cobham, which was backed by shareholders in September. 

The U.S. private equity group also bought British electronics company Laird for $1.65 billion last year.

Lopez Obrador, a leftist who has long-favored more robust state control over oil and power industries, said the CFE's share of Mexican power generation market could grow to as much as 70% from about 56% currently by the end of his term in 2024.
""If the private sector doesn't invest, we'll do it ourselves. We may end my term with 60 or 70 percent of market production coming through the CFE,"" he said in the speech at one of the company's new natural gas-fueled plants in western Michoacan state.
Lopez Obrador also pledged to boost CFE finances with a restructuring of its debt, but did not specify an amount or a timeline.
Nearing the end of his first year in office, Lopez Obrador has shifted sharply away from some of the business-friendly policies embraced by his predecessor, centrist President Enrique Pena Nieto, who enacted a sweeping energy market liberalization in 2013.
While Lopez Obrador has said he would not seek to constitutionally reverse the reforms, he has canceled competitive oil and power auctions since he took office late last year."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The group behind Nord Stream 2 said on Saturday it aimed to complete a pipeline to boost Russian gas supplies to Europe as soon as possible, after U.S. sanctions prompted a major contractor to suspend pipe-laying activities.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill on Friday that included legislation imposing sanctions on firms laying pipe for Nord Stream 2, which seeks to double gas capacity along the northern Nord Stream pipeline route to Germany.
Washington, which has been seeking to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas (LNG) to European states, has said Nord Stream 2 will make Europe too reliant on Russian supplies.
Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), Russia's state-controlled gas giant and a major backer of Nord Stream 2, already supplies more than a third of Europe's gas needs. The company declined to comment.
Nord Stream 2 will help Russia bypass Ukraine, the main route for Russian gas. Moscow and Kiev, which have been at loggerheads over Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, agreed a new transit deal this week after long-running talks.
The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will run along the Baltic Sea floor, was expected to start up in the first half of 2020.
""Completing the project is essential for European supply security. We together with the companies supporting the project will work on finishing the pipeline as soon as possible,"" Nord Stream 2 said on Saturday. It did not provide details.
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said Berlin ""firmly rejects"" U.S. sanctions but would not retaliate.
Nord Stream 2 contractor, Swiss-Dutch company Allseas, announced on Friday it had suspended pipe-laying activities.
The company said it would ""proceed, consistent with the legislation's wind down provision"" and said it expected guidance on the regulatory, technical and environmental issues from the U.S. authority.
UKRAINE ROUTE
Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that Moscow ""will continue to implement its economic projects regardless of anyone's sanctions.""
A senior Russian senator also said the Nord Stream 2 must stick to its schedule.
Russia and Ukraine, embroiled in a political row and legal disputes, agreed their new gas transit deal shortly before the existing pact expires at the end of this year.
Moscow had initially insisted on a short-term agreement to run until Nord Stream 2 came on stream. Ukraine, which earns hefty revenues from gas transit fees, wanted a long-term deal.
Moscow and Kiev said on Saturday the new deal would last at least five years and could be extended for a further 10. They said it would include increased gas transport fees and set out gas volumes to be booked for transit through Ukraine.
Nord Stream 2, which aims to double the Nord Stream route's existing capacity of 55 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas a year, is owned by Gazprom, which is financing half of the project worth about 9.5 billion euros ($10.5 billion).
Other partners in Nord Stream 2 are Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV), the German firms Uniper (DE:UN01) and Wintershall (DE:BASFn), Anglo-Dutch energy major Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and France's Engie (PA:ENGIE).

Alitalia, which is losing 2 million euros ($2.2 million) a day, was put under a new temporary administrator this month after a consortium of potential rescuers backed out.
Patuanelli was quoted as saying by Italian newspaper Il Messaggero that he had signed off a further loan of 400 million euros this week to keep the loss-making carrier in business.
""This is really the last state intervention for Alitalia,"" Patuanelli said adding that either a buyer was found by mid 2020 or the company ""would shut down"".
The minister dismissed the possibility of the loan being considered illegal state aid by the European Commission.
""We will change the Alitalia brand and the company's structure,"" Patuanelli said, without elaborating.
Industry analysts calculate Alitalia, which went through two previous rescues in 2008 and 2014, has already burned through roughly 9 billion of euros in taxpayers' money."
1226,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2019 04:00AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: History suggests rally may slow for U.S. stocks in 2020,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The outsized rally in the U.S. stock market this year may give way to a more muted performance in 2020 if history is any guide.
The benchmark S&P 500 is up nearly 28% for the year, which if the market closed this week for the year, would mark the second-best annual performance for the index since 1997. 
However, investors who are hoping the rally will continue charging ahead through next year may be disappointed. The S&P 500 has returned an average of 6.6% in the year following a rally of 20% or more since 1928, slightly below the 7.6% return in all years, according to research from Bespoke Investment Group. 
Fund managers and strategists say there are several reasons to believe that the stock market will not continue on a path of notching double-digit annual returns like it did during the late '90s tech bubble.
""We're up a lot this year, but we had a historically bad 4th quarter last year,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial. ""This isn't because of spectacular growth in the economy but the market realizing that we're not going to have a recession."" 
The S&P 500 posted its biggest drop since the 2008 financial crisis last year as investors worried that the trade war between the United States and China would push the global economy into a recession. The Federal Reserve's decision to change course in early January from its path of raising interest rates helped fuel the rally in the stock market this year. 
The Fed also helped spark a bond rally that pushed 10-year Treasury yields near historic lows and boosted dividend-paying stocks, further pointing to concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW). 
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 vs U.S. bonds - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/7836/7818/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
""There are not a lot of investors in the bond markets losing their shirts because the economy is running ahead of expectations,"" she said. 
The November presidential and congressional elections will likely weigh on politically sensitive sectors like healthcare as 2020 progresses, Sonders said, adding another market headwind that could prevent another string of outsized gains like the late 1990s.
""You had a bunch of strong years back then because we were in the midst of a tech bubble and there was no cap on valuations. Now we have real legitimate companies but there's not the same sign of excess valuation,"" she said. 
Few on Wall Street expect a bear market in 2020. There are few signs of a recession looming in the year ahead, while the market has seemed unfazed by issues such as President Donald Trump's impeachment or ongoing trade tensions, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities. 
""Given historically low interest rates and risk premiums, we believe valuations have further to run,"" he said. He added that he expects the S&P 500 to end 2020 near 3,425, a roughly 7% gain from its Thursday trading price. 
Investors may realize larger gains by investing in smaller companies next year, said Steven Chiavarone, a portfolio manager of the Federated Global Allocation fund. 
Large-cap stocks in the S&P 500 are over-valued compared with the smaller companies in the Russell 2000 index, he said. At the same time, the Russell 2000 slightly underperformed the larger index this year by posting a 23.2% gain, leaving it primed for a ""catch-up trade"" given that smaller companies tend to benefit more from low interest rates, he said. 
""We think there's a chance that you will see upside surprises from earnings next year and that could draw investors back to an asset class they've been overlooking,"" said Chiavarone.

The deal, which has immediate effect upon BASF's reporting, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2020, according to the statement.
Reuters reported last month that Lone Star was in negotiations to buy the BASF unit.
The private equity firm vied with a consortium comprising buyout groups Cinven - which owns peer Chryso - and Bain for the world's largest maker of chemical additives for concrete, sources told Reuters in November.
Lone Star had previously walked away from the bidding but was invited back to the negotiating table.
BASF's construction chemicals unit is the world's largest maker of additives for concrete. It also offers a range of substances including concrete repair fillers, grouts and sealants under a business dubbed Construction Systems, where BASF is the No. 4 player globally.
BASF purchased the construction chemicals business from Degussa in 2006 for 2.7 billion euros including debt."

(Reuters) - PG&E Corp's (N:PCG) creditors have sweetened their offer to California wildfire victims, saying they are now prepared to pay $13.5 billion in cash upfront, according to a letter sent on Friday to state governor Gavin Newsom.
Current terms of the settlement deal, approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Tuesday, call for half of the settlement to be financed with stock in a newly reorganized PG&E.
In the letter, the bondholders led by Elliott Management said their latest proposals will make sure individual victims ""are prioritized, as they should be"" and will address demands Newsom had raised earlier.
Newsom said on Dec. 13 that the settlement had lacked major changes in governance and tougher safety enforcement mechanisms mandated under the state wildfire statute. It would also leave the company with a weakened capital structure and ""limited ability to withstand future financial and operational headwinds.""
The new plan calls for no debt at the reorganized holding company and a new board with residents from California forming the majority of directors.
It also allows for a takeover of PG&E by the state if the company is found to have caused any single future wildfire that destroys more than 5,000 structures.
PG&E said after the disclosure of the letter that it is continuing to talk with the stakeholders. Newsom's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours on Friday.
PG&E said earlier it had reached a deal with labor, safety and customer advocacy groups calling for regulators to allow PG&E to implement some rate increases for funding wildfire-prevention efforts and safety improvements.
A term sheet submitted with Friday's letter showed utility customer rate increases will be capped at 3% through 2023.
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 protection in January, citing potential liabilities in excess of $30 billion from deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment.
It came under renewed criticism this year for precautionary power outages to guard against the risk of wildfires posed by extremely dry and windy weather."
1229,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 09:11PM ET</span>",German finance minister: tax on share dealing could be extended to other assets,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The financial transaction tax on share dealing that 10 European countries hope to introduce from 2021 could be extended to cover trading in riskier assets, German finance minister Olaf Scholz said.
Scholz's plan for a tax of 0.2% of the transaction value of purchases of shares in large companies was widely criticized when floated this month, with critics angered that it excluded the volatile, leveraged instruments that they believe drive market instability.
But Scholz told the Funke newspaper consortium in an interview to be published on Saturday that extending the tax to other asset classes would require a broader European consensus.
""If experiences with the introduction are positive then it will be easier to achieve that consensus,"" he was quoted as saying.
Apart from Germany, which wants to use the tax to finance a 1.5 billion euro plan for a minimum pension, the countries that plan to introduce the tax are Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.
Separately, Scholz told the newspaper that he hoped to secure agreement with Germany's states for an agreement that would relieve heavily indebted municipalities of their most crippling debts, freeing them to invest again.
Some 2,500 municipalities, mainly in north-western Germany, would be affected by the measure, which would see the federal government joining forces with the states in which the communes were located to assume some 20 billion euros in debt.
While the low interest rate environment was favorable for such a measure, Scholz said he needed the acquiescence of wealthier states like Bavaria, which did not need the debt relief.
""In federal states it's sometimes like a family, where one child complains when the other gets a new jacket,"" Scholz said. ""We can only find a good answer if the states that don't have difficulties don't insist on getting something.""
With Germany's economy cooling markedly after a decade-long boom, Scholz has faced pressure to clear the way for stimulus spending, something he has been reluctant to do."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The mayor of a Michigan steel town was attending his grandchildren's Christmas play Thursday evening when he got an unwelcome voicemail from an official of the town's top employer: United States Steel Corp (N:X). 
U.S. Steel was about to send out a press release announcing layoffs for 1,545 workers and the idling of a significant portion of operations at the Great Lakes Works facility, according to the voicemail received by Michael Bowdler, mayor of River Rouge, a city of 7,500 that sits on the Detroit River roughly 10 miles south of Detroit.
In the voicemail to Bowdler, heard by Reuters, the U.S. Steel official called the layoffs ""terrible news"" and attributed the decision to weak demand, lower steel prices and new corporate strategy.
Domestic steel prices, after rising in the immediate aftermath of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on steel imports, have fallen amid weakening demand from the auto and other manufacturing sectors. 
In the 2016 presidential election, Trump won Michigan by less than 11,000 votes. But with its factories shedding thousands of jobs, the state is seen as up for grabs in the 2020 election.
Steel production at Great Lakes Works will stop around April 1 and the hot-strip mill rolling facility will cease operations before the end of next year, U.S. Steel said in its statement released on Thursday. Production will be shifted to Gary Works in Indiana, the statement added.
The latest layoffs, which would impact 94% of the Michigan facility's workforce, come months after U.S. Steel decided to temporarily lay off 48 employees at Great Lakes Works and warned of up to 200 more layoffs. 
The Great Lakes plant primarily serves the automotive industry. It is the lifeline of the cities of Ecorse and River Rouge, which house the plant.
Local officials had worked out a deal to give tax breaks to the company for a $600 million investment to carry out upgrades at Great Lakes Works. They thought the investment was the company's commitment to stay invested in the towns.
In September, a U.S. Steel spokeswoman told Reuters that the incentives would help preserve jobs in the region.
After Thursday's developments, Bowdler did not know whether the tax deal would be put before the city council for approval.
U.S. Steel told Reuters on Friday that its discussions with the two cities about the tax deal were ""paused"" earlier this year.
Bowdler said the company's move will result in a $1 million hit on the city's finances and could also dampen the business of its retailers.
U.S. Steel's new strategy to ramp up investments at three mills in North America - Mon Valley plant in Pennsylvania, Gary Works in Indiana and Big River Steel in Arkansas, which the company expects to fully acquire within the next four years - had thrown into doubt the future of the Michigan plant.
Martin Englert, a steel industry analyst for brokerage firm Jefferies LLC, called the idling of Great Lakes an ""incremental positive"" for the company.
U.S. Steel's stock closed down Friday about 11% at $11.91 as the company announced a dividend cut and forecast a wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter. The company's shares have plunged 75% since March 1, 2018, when Trump announced his decision to crack down on foreign steel imports.

Prices of hot-rolled coil are down 41% from their 2018 peak, hurting the profits of American steel companies. U.S. Steel, which saw a record profit in 2018 on soaring steel prices, reported a loss in the latest quarter on slowing demand.

(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) newly instated Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai would receive a hefty $240 million in performance-based stock awards over the next three years, the highest ever promised to any executive of the search giant.
Pichai would also take home $2 million in annual salary starting 2020, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. That compares with a $1 salary received by Larry Page in the same role last year. (https:// ""In terms of grants related to CEO appointments, it's behind Tim Cook's grant of $376 million when he took over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"" said Amit Batish, marketing manager at Equilar, a firm that tracks executive compensations.
Google co-founders Page and Sergey Brin stepped down earlier this month as leaders of the internet behemoth they founded 21 years ago, giving Pichai charge of the parent company in addition to his role as the chief of Google.
Trusted lieutenant Pichai, who has spent 15 years at Google, is now the public face of a company that is facing criticism from U.S. lawmakers as well as its employees over a number of issues ranging from privacy to monopoly.
When he took over as Google's chief in 2015, Pichai drew an annual salary of $652,500. The following year his earnings skyrocketed, thanks to a massive $199 million in stock awards, the highest ever for any Alphabet executive back then.
Pichai is widely credited for making the Google chrome browser a success and was seen as a potential successor to  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) CEO Steve Ballmer before Satya Nadella took over in February 2014.
According to the most recent proxy statement from the company, Pichai earned nearly $1.9 million in 2018, which mostly included the costs for his security and personal use of aircraft. His base salary that year was $650,000.
Median CEO base salary reached $1.2 million among the largest U.S. companies by revenue in 2018, according to Equilar."
1232,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 07:29PM ET</span>",U.S. transport chief said economic issues not a factor in 737 MAX's safety review,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The economic impact of Boeing Co's (N:BA) planned halt of 737 MAX production will not be considered by U.S. regulators in their ongoing review of when to end the grounding of a plane involved in two major fatal crashes, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Friday.
In an interview with Reuters, Chao said the White House has not pressured the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to speed up its review.
Chao also said the White House Council of Economic Advisers had conducted a study of the economic impact of the grounding, which forced Boeing - a critical American manufacturing company - to halt deliveries in March, and assessed that it would cause around a 0.4% reduction in U.S. gross domestic product.
""Regardless as to what the impact on GDP is, our responsibility is to ensure that the 737 MAX must be safe before it is ungrounded,"" Chao said, adding that ""my job is protect"" the FAA from any pressure the agency might face.
The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since March after two crashes involving Boeing's fastest-selling jet in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months, costing the plane manufacturer more than $9 billion so far.
On Friday, United Airlines (O:UAL) said it is extending cancellations of Boeing 737 MAX flights from early March until June. United's announcement is the longest that any U.S. carrier has scheduled for the grounded aircraft, after American Airlines (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) canceled flights into early April.
Chao said her directive to FAA Administrator Steve Dickson is clear: ""ensure that he finds out what happened, correct the problem and do not unground until FAA feels that it is safe.""
President Donald Trump, who has touted the strength of the U.S. economy as he seeks re-election in 2020, called Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg on Sunday to ask about the status of 737 MAX production, citing two people briefed on the matter confirmed.
Muilenburg assured Trump that the planned production halt was temporary and that the company would not be laying off any workers, the sources said. The production halt, set to begin in January, was announced by Boeing on Monday.
Reuters reported this week the FAA is not expected to end the grounding until at least February.
Chao said of Boeing: ""They've got a tough challenge ahead of them and they owe it to the American people to ensure that their airplane is safe. And I think they want that, too.""
Boeing said on Friday it continues ""to follow the lead of the FAA and global regulators, as they will determine the timeline for certification so the MAX can safely return to service.""
Chao said reforms to the FAA's longstanding process of delegating some certification tasks to Boeing should be not be adopted until a number of reviews are completed.
""Let's wait to see what the reports say before we act too quickly,"" Chao said.

The FAA's practice of delegating some certification tasks to Boeing has come under criticism from lawmakers and in some official reports, including the FAA's failure to more closely evaluate a key safety system involved in both fatal crashes. The FAA is not delegating any tasks in the ongoing review.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 05:58PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. talks with GM over deploying self-driving cars without steering wheels,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is holding talks with General Motors Co (N:GM) on the automaker's petition to deploy a limited number of self-driving vehicles on American roads without steering wheels or other human controls, the head of the agency said on Friday.
Acting NHTSA Administrator James Owens said his agency aims to make a decision soon on GM's January 2018 petition as well as a request by Softbank Corp-backed (T:9434) driverless delivery startup Nuro to deploy a limited number of low-speed, highly automated delivery vehicles without human occupants. 
The agency's review comes at a time of heightened concerns about the safety of automated piloting systems in vehicles and aircraft, a potential revolution in ground and air transportation.
""I expect we're going to be able to move forward with these petitions soon - as soon as we can,"" Owens told Reuters, adding action ""definitely"" would come next year.
""This will be a big deal because this will be the first such action that will be taken,"" Owens said.
GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, confirmed it has been in talks with NHTSA about the petition. Nuro also confirmed it is in talks with NHTSA.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao last week met and discussed the petition at a high level, officials said, but significant work remains at the technical level. Owens said NHTSA officials are ""crawling through these petitions because we want to make sure"" they are at least as safe as cars on the roads.
""There's a lot of back and forth between us and the companies,"" Owens said during a Reuters interview that also included Chao and other Transportation Department officials. ""We're sharing with them thoughts and ideas and concerns. They come back to us with additional information."" 
Chao said it is important that the NHTSA take its time in reviewing the GM petition. Chao suggested that some auto industry officials and analysts were too optimistic about the timing for deployment of fully autonomous vehicles.
""I think the complexity was far greater than what a lot of very optimistic advocates were thinking,"" Chao said. 
In GM's petition, NHTSA is for the first time looking at a vehicle in which all driving decisions are made by a computer rather than a human driver. Nuro, which partnered with  Kroger Co  (N:KR) last year to deliver groceries, seeks approval not to include a windshield in the vehicle.
The petitions - formal applications for action by the agency - seek exemptions from U.S. vehicle safety rules largely written decades ago that assumed human drivers would be in control of a vehicle. The petitions are for up to 2,500 vehicles per manufacturer.
GM initially said it hoped to win approval to deploy the vehicles by the end of this year. But in July its self-driving unit, Cruise, said it was delaying commercial deployment of cars as more testing of the vehicles was required without specifying a new target date.
Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo unit this year began offering some rides with no human driver in its limited autonomous ride-hailing service in Arizona, but with steering wheels and employees watching remote feeds of the vehicles' cameras.
""We're in communication with them about how they are ensuring the safe operation of the vehicle,"" Owens said. ""We will continue having a back and forth with them.""

Shaw's Orienteer platform, the backbone of the $50 billion investment firm's multi-asset class offerings, posted high double-digit returns this year, the best ever in its six year lifetime.
The Orienteer platform's HV variant gained 41.3% through November while the main Orienteer strategy gained 25.8% during the same time, a person familiar with the returns said.
Orienteer, launched in mid-2013 with less than $100 million in capital, now manages $2.2 billion in assets in a way that seeks risk exposure across conventional assets classes like stocks, commodities, credit and rates.
Each of the Orienteer strategies -- HV variant and the main strategy -- handily outperformed risk parity benchmarks. The HFR Risk Parity Vol 15 Institutional Index returned 27.3% while the HFR Risk Parity Vol 10 Institutional Index gained 18.8%, according to data from the research group.
A spokesman for D.E. Shaw declined to comment.
Risk parity funds use an allocation approach to try to build a diversified portfolio in which each asset group -- equity, credit, rates and inflation -- contributes an equal amount of risk so that the return is not primarily determined by stocks.
The strategy, first pioneered in the 1990s, captured investors' attention after the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, which launched its risk-parity All Weather Fund in 1996, and AQR Capital Management are big investors in the space.
Orienteer has gained in all four of its underlying risk categories, fueled by positive results from a mix of systematic and discretionary bets.
D.E. Shaw, founded in 1988, was long known for investing strategies driven by computer models, but over the years it has branched out into other strategies.
Hedge funds have generally had a more positive year in 2019 with the average fund gaining 8.6% through November, data from HFR show."
1239,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 04:23PM ET</span>",SEC proposes allowing more investors access to private companies,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday proposed changes to its decades-old definition of a professional investor in order to allow more Americans to buy shares in private companies.
The agency hopes the changes will boost retail investors' access to the swelling pool of companies that are staying private for longer and longer, but it has sparked worries among some investor advocates who say even seasoned investors struggle to spot problems with private companies.
Under current SEC rules, individuals who wish to put their money into the high-risk, high-yield private markets must earn an individual annual income over $200,000, or a combined $300,000 in shared annual income between spouses. 
Alternatively, an individual may hold at least $1 million in assets, excluding one's home.
These standards constitute the ""accredited investor"" designation.
Wednesday's proposed changes, which are subject to public consultation, would broaden the definition to include a test of an investor's sophistication level ""based on professional knowledge, experience, or certifications,"" the agency said.
The SEC said it was not clear yet how many people would meet the expanded definition, but it is seeking to capture eligible investors, like employees of hedge funds and holders of Series 7 and other licenses, who may not qualify based solely on income and wealth, but are ""knowledgeable"" of the risk in private offerings. 
The SEC's proposal would not seek to raise the definition's current income or wealth requirements, but seeks comment on whether any thresholds should be lowered in parts of the United States where income levels may be lower.
The changes would also afford access to more institutional investors, including a so-called catch-all category for entities owning in excess of $5 million in investments.
The SEC under its Republican-appointed chairman Jay Clayton has steadily cut red tape to make the public capital markets more attractive for companies since 2017.
Simultaneously, the agency has sought to expand choices in private offerings, a sector that has raised $191 billion in the first nine months of 2019, which nearly matches the amount of capital raised in all of 2018.
""I believe it is important to focus on solutions that provide access to investment opportunities on substantially the same terms as those that would be available to institutional investors with protections ... that are akin to the protections in our public market,"" Clayton said on Wednesday.
Wall Street would likely praise the move as fund executives have long advocated for looser rules.
""The SEC is trying to increase investor participation in private offerings in a way that allows various types of registered and private funds to serve as gatekeepers for sophistication and access, rather than arbitrary income and wealth metrics,"" said Lawrence Stadulis, a partner at Washington-based Stradley Ronon.
The recent IPO fiasco of office leasing company WeWork is cited by investor advocates as an example of how even seasoned investors are sometimes unable to spot private-company pitfalls. WeWork's IPO had to be pulled in September after a lackluster response from investors due to concerns about its corporate governance standards.

(This story corrects to make clear holding $1 million in assets excluding home is an alternative route to ""accredited investor"" designation under current rules)

1240,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>","Twitter Suspends 90,000 Accounts Used to Spread Saudi Spam","(Bloomberg) --  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). removed almost 90,000 accounts linked to the Saudi Arabian government that researchers identified as part of a sweeping, state-backed propaganda campaign to spread their geopolitical interests.
The accounts were “amplifying messages favorable to Saudi authorities” by using their large volume to aggressively like, retweet and reply to tweets related to local and western politics, Twitter said Friday in a blog post. The messaging specifically targeted discussions around Iranian sanctions and the murder of Saudi national and journalist Jamal Khashoggi, said Renee DiResta, research Manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, which analyzed the tweets.
Researchers traced the source of the coordinated activity to Smaat, a Saudi-based social media and marketing company linked to the government which is controlled by the royal family. Smaat’s own accounts have been suspended, along with those of the company’s senior executives, according to the blog post.
Twitter’s decision to suspend the Saudi accounts came a month after two former Twitter employees and a Saudi national were charged by the U.S. with helping Riyadh spy on dissidents who used the social network. Among those charged was Ahmed Saad Almutairi, an executive with Smaat, who was working on behalf of the royal family, according to court filings.
Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal owned about 4.9% of Twitter, according to company filings on Dec. 31, 2016, which are the most recent records of his stake available.
The campaign removed by Twitter is the type that tech companies say they are hunting down in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in which Russian operatives used platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Google’s YouTube to try to sway voter opinion.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., for example, had removed more than a dozen “coordinated inauthentic behavior” campaigns this year from countries like Russia, Iran, China and Israel. On Friday, the company announced it had taken down two unconnected networks of more than 1,300 accounts, pages and groups that originated in Georgia, Vietnam and the U.S. for engaging in foreign and government interference. In these efforts, actors spread disinformation and even created fake profile photos using artificial intelligence in an attempt to influence public opinion using false identities, a violation of Facebook’s policies."
1241,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 04:01PM ET</span>",Canadian drug distributors say no to Trump import plan,"By Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - Many of Canada's drug suppliers cannot, or will not, agree to ship cheaper prescription medicines into the United States, a new challenge to the Trump administration's push to reduce drug prices, companies and industry officials told Reuters.
The administration on Wednesday proposed new regulations that would allow states to import prescription drugs from Canada. They would require a state such as Florida to partner with a wholesaler licensed by Health Canada, which regulates drugs.
Florida and other states have said they are eager to start importation programs, and the proposal took the federal government one step closer to approving that plan. But there are practical barriers to actually bringing in drugs.
Two drug distributors and two Canadian industry groups that between them represent all of the potential suppliers named in a proposal published by Florida in August said they are not interested in participating.
""We have not been contacted and we are not planning to participate,"" said  Loblaw Companies Ltd  (TO:L), which owns Canada's largest pharmacy chain Shoppers Drug Mart. ""Canadian patients currently face product and drug shortages and we are concerned this initiative may exacerbate what is already a critical issue.""
Daniel Chiasson, president of the Canadian Association for Pharmacy Distribution Management (CAPDM), said none of its members would participate because their first priority was ensuring a safe and stable supply of medication for Canadians.
""It surprised everyone when their names appeared on that list,"" said Chiasson.
Mary Mayhew, secretary of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, said she was ""excited and enthusiastic"" about Wednesday's announcement.
""We are optimistic that Canadian suppliers will be interested, as the rule is understood, as there is more dialogue around this new and historic federal action,"" she said.
Chiasson said agreements between manufacturers and distributors prevent the export of products made for the Canadian market, creating a commercial risk and deterrent to exporting.
""These are issues we continue to consider and are committed to exploring how we might overcome any challenges and issues as we advance the proposed rule,"" U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokesman Michael Felberbaum said in a statement.
Some of Canada's major distributors are subsidiaries of U.S. companies, who are unlikely to participate in a program to lower prices, since their revenue reflects a cut of the value of the drugs they provide to pharmacies in the much larger U.S. market.
McKesson Canada, a subsidiary of McKesson Corp (N:MCK) referred questions to Chiasson. The organization is also a listed member of the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies Canada, a lobby group that opposes drug exports to the United States.
AmerisourceBergen (N:ABC) said that protecting bottom lines was not the issue, because importation implied that distributors could buy low-cost drugs and sell them in high-cost markets.
""The reality is that legal and contractual barriers, as well as significant threat to the integrity of the supply chain, all stand in the way of importation being a viable solution,"" it said in a statement.
Kohl & Frisch, a large closely-held distributor, did not respond to requests for comment.  Metro Inc  (TO:MRU) which owns major pharmacy chain Jean Coutu, declined to comment.
One company on Florida's list is not a distributor in any traditional sense, but makes self-serve pharmacy kiosks that resemble vending machines. They confirmed they would have no role in any import plan.
The remaining companies are members of the Association québécoise des distributeurs en pharmacie, which takes the same position as CAPDM.
""Our members have no intention to sell drugs across the border, particularly in light of the rapidly increasing drug shortages in the Québec marketplace,"" said Director General Hugues Mousseau in a statement."

The data, as of Dec. 17, includes consumers who were granted an extension because they were unable to complete the enrollment process on Dec. 15, the initial deadline for open enrollment. 
These numbers are preliminary and do not represent final 2020 Exchange Open Enrollment figures, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said.
On Monday, the CMS extended the deadline for enrollment via the website by three days to Dec. 18 after people faced technical issues during the final hours of the enrollment deadline. 
Over half a million consumers signed up on Sunday, the initial deadline for open enrollment, according to the CMS.
Last year, 8.5 million people signed up for 2019 health plans, about 4% lower than the preceding year.
""Through the first six weeks of open enrollment, the comparable daily average number of plan selections was running 2.5% behind last year's pace,"" Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said in a note earlier this week. 
The CMS runs enrollment for insurance plans created by the ACA, often referred to as Obamacare, through the online marketplace HealthCare.gov for 38 states. Thirteen states, including District of Columbia, have separate state-based exchanges for enrollment with their own deadlines. 
The Healthcare.gov platform accounts for 73% of national enrollment, while state-based exchanges represent 24%, according to Newshel. 
""Similar to prior years, many of these states are seeing better growth than the federal platform,"" Newshel said on Monday, citing reports from 8 of the 13 state-based exchanges.
The ACA, often considered the signature domestic achievement of former President Barack Obama, faced fierce opposition from the Trump administration that sought to overturn it in Congress and via courts. 
In October, the government said monthly premiums for an average 2020 Obamacare health insurance plan will fall by about 4% from this year.

CMS plans to release an updated snapshot during the second week of January with the final enrollment data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of five U.S. senators sent a letter on Thursday to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (N:JPM), asking it to explain what it was doing to address what they described as ""a troubling list of discriminatory practices"" related to race.
The letter was signed by five prominent Democrats, including presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and the top Democrat on the Senate banking panel, Sherrod Brown.
The letter referred to a New York Times article last week that reported https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/business/jpmorgan-banking-racism.html cases of racial discrimination at some of the bank's branches in the Phoenix, Arizona area.
In the letter, the lawmakers ask for details on where the bank is opening and closing branches, questioning how it is serving white and minority neighborhoods. It also requests a history of all regulatory penalties imposed on the bank related to discrimination.
The letter also asks the bank to explain its efforts to boost diversity in its senior ranks, and other policies the bank has in place to ensure no one is improperly treated on the basis of race.
The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Earlier this month, Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, told employees he was ""disgusted by racism and hate in any form"" in a memo sent shortly after the New York Times report was published. He also vowed to improve the bank's practices."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's bank watchdog is stepping up an inquiry into staff surveillance at  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), it said on Friday, as pressure mounts on the bank to explain a second alleged instance of an executive being tailed.
Credit Suisse said on Tuesday it was looking into a report by a Swiss newspaper that its then-human resources boss was followed by private detectives in February. The report revived concerns about its practices after a similar surveillance operation uncovered in September rocked Switzerland's financial center and prompted the ousting of one of Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam's long-term associates.
Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that a former executive at a Credit Suisse joint venture told top bank executives as well as U.S. and Swiss authorities that she was put under surveillance in 2017 while in a dispute with the bank.
""The observation activities carried out by Credit Suisse raise various compliance issues,"" financial market supervisor FINMA said in a statement on Friday. ""FINMA's ongoing investigations of this matter will now be stepped up with the help of an independent auditor.""
Credit Suisse in October cleared its CEO of snooping on star wealth manager Iqbal Khan after he left the bank for arch-rival UBS (S:UBSG), in an incident that badly damaged the second-biggest Swiss bank's reputation and which its board described as ""wrong and disproportionate"".
Khan, 43, went to the police after a Sept. 17 confrontation with at least one detective who was shadowing him and his wife as they drove through Zurich.
The emergence of a second alleged case of surveillance, reported in detail in Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung (NZZ) earlier this week, comes as an embarrassment after its chairman said the bank did not condone surveillance of employees. An investigation ordered by the bank into the first case of snooping said it had found no evidence Credit Suisse had ordered observation of other employees.
The probe conducted by law firm Homburger found only two employees -- then-Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee and the security boss under him, who both resigned -- knew of the surveillance of Khan, which prompted a criminal investigation that remains ongoing. 
""Of course I didn't know. I hesitate to say it, but it happens in international companies that one has to do these kind of things,"" Thiam said in a later interview with Swiss broadcaster RTS. ""But it's a legitimate weapon that the bank sometimes unfortunately has to use to protect its business.""
A senior officer working in the business intelligence industry who asked not to be named said spying on employees was ""very, very rare"" in Switzerland and should only be conducted with a very high level of approval within a company.
""It is very sensitive and it can be very damaging if it gets into the public domain,"" he said.
Following FINMA's statement on Friday, Credit Suisse said it was nearing the completion of its own investigation and would publish the results on Monday.

""Credit Suisse will continue to fully cooperate with FINMA,"" it said.

TURIN, Italy (Reuters) - Unions at carmaker  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) said management had given assurances at a meeting on Friday on jobs and a 5 billion euro ($5.54 billion) investment plan in Italy following the group's planned merger with French rival PSA (PA:PEUP).
The meeting at Fiat Chrysler's Mirafiori plant in Turin follows confirmation on Wednesday that the two groups had agreed a binding $50 billion tie-up to create the world's fourth-largest carmaker.
""They assured us that all 400,000 employees of the new group would be guaranteed. There will not be redundancies,"" said Rocco Palombella, head of the UILM metalworkers union.
The two groups have targeted 3.7 billion euros in cost savings from the merger but have promised that it will not lead to plant closures.
The French and Italian governments have welcomed the tie-up but are keen to see jobs protected.
Francesca Re David, leader of the FIOM-CGIL labor group, one of the most important union bodies representing the company's workers, said before the meeting that ""not shutting down plants does not mean guaranteeing job levels"".
However labor group representatives said not only had management promised to avoid redundancies, they had also pledged to get all group employees off special furlough arrangements and back to work by 2022.
In addition, a 5 billion euro investment plan for Italy by 2021 would be maintained, with most of the investment coming next year.
""What we gathered was that absolutely nothing will happen for a year but in 2021 decisions will be taken on platforms, motors and technology,"" Palombella said.
However Re David, whose union has taken a harder line than the other labor groups, said her group wanted to see new models to ensure workers would be taken out of the so-called ""cassa integrazione"" wage guarantee fund for furloughed employees.
""Industrial plans have never been respected in the past. We have a lot of worries. The announcements on new models are positive, but we'll be vigilant about the implementation of the plan,"" she said.
Marco Bentivogli, head of the Fim-Cisl union, said unions would work to agree how to select a worker representative for the board of the combined group.
""It will have to be a representative authorized to represent the interests of the workforce and not chosen by the company,"" he said.

Under the merger agreement, two labor representatives, one from the Italian side and one from the French side, will sit on the 11-member board of the combined company.

The recent run-up is a stunning turnaround for the shares, triggered by a rare quarterly profit in October, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and upbeat early deposits for its recently launched electric pickup truck.
The shares have climbed about 40% since the earnings. At roughly $74 billion, the company's market capitalization tops by about $20 billion that of the biggest U.S. automaker by production, General Motors Co (N:GM), and is nearly twice that of rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
But the tweet in August 2018 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share finally cost Musk and the company $20 million in fines each by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision.
Wall Street remains divided, with 13 brokerages recommending ""sell"" or lower, and 11 rating the stock ""buy"" or higher. Nine have a ""hold"" rating.
""Given the clash between Elon Musk's long-term goals/vision and the near-term fundamentals, Tesla stock is the ultimate sentiment pendulum,"" analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote on Friday, hiking its price target by $70 to $290.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - For long-term shareholders of Netflix (O:NFLX), the end of December marks an extremely rewarding decade.
Shares of the video-streaming heavyweight have surged over 4,100% since the end of 2009, making it the S&P 500's top performer over the past 10 years. Analysts mostly recommend investors keep buying the shares, even as the Los Gatos, California, company faces a surge in competition and questions about whether it can maintain its rapid user growth.

DECADE'S WORST LOSERS GRAPHIC
The dramatic rise of Netflix's business and share price established the company as part of the so-called FANG quartet of high-growth stocks - along with Facebook (O:FB), Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Google-owner Alphabet (O:GOOGL) - that captivated investors and accounted for much of Wall Street's rally in recent years. Netflix expanded its subscriber base from 12 million at the end of 2009 to 158 million last September.
But at the start of 2010, when mailing DVDs to customers was still a large chunk of Netflix's business, the average analyst recommendation for the company was ""hold,"" making it one of the S&P 500 stocks least favored by analysts at that time.
As well as being the top overall performer across the decade, Netflix was the S&P 500's strongest annual performer in 2010, 2013 and 2015, gaining 219%, 298% and 134% in each of those years, respectively.
(GRAPHIC: Top S&P 500 performers by year - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/42/42/Top%20Winners%20by%20Year.jpg)
The only other S&P 500 component leading the index more than once on an annual basis over the decade was chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (O:AMD), which surged 80% last year and is on track to gain 132% in 2019. Up over 340% since the end of 2009, AMD's recent surge marks a comeback after a downturn in personal computer sales in the first half of the decade had many investors questioning whether the chipmaker would survive at all in the shadow of semiconductor giant Intel (O:INTC).
Under Chief Executive Lisa Su, who took over in 2014, AMD stopped losing money and is expected by analysts to expand its bottom line by over 40% in 2019, according to Refinitiv.
Following its stellar stock market performance, Netflix is now struggling with slowing subscriber growth, ballooning costs to produce content and new competition from Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) and other services. With Netflix up 24% in 2019 and falling short of the S&P 500's 28% gain, analysts on average now recommend buying its shares. The stock remains down 20% from its record high close in July 2018.
The S&P 500's second-strongest performer of the decade has been electronic bond trading system operator MarketAxess Holdings Inc (O:MKTX), up over 2,600%, followed by medical equipment maker Abiomed (O:ABMD), which has surged over 1,800%.
In ninth place is Ulta Beauty (O:ULTA), which has flourished even as other shopping mall retailers struggled to fend off Amazon and is up 1,280% over the decade. Amazon (O:AMZN) clocks in as the decade's 11th-strongest S&P 500 performer, gaining 1,232%.
Investors buying the stocks most highly rated on average by analysts at the start of the decade, and holding them through 2019, mostly would have done well. But investors buying and holding the stocks least liked by analysts at the end of 2009 also would have fared well.

Among current S&P 500 components, Incyte (O:INCY), CMS Energy (N:CMS), J M Smucker (N:SJM), United Airlines (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) were the stocks with the highest aggregate analyst rating at the end of 2009, and of those, only J M Smucker underperformed the S&P 500's total return of over 250% during the decade, including dividends. The five stocks least liked by analysts at the start of the decade were Ameren (N:AEE), Brown-Forman (N:BFb), Apartment Investment and Management Co (N:AIV), Hershey (N:HSY) and American International Group (N:AIG), and of those, only AIG has underperformed the S&P 500.
As the decade nears its finish, just one stock in the S&P 500 has an average analyst rating of ""sell"": Franklin Resources (N:BEN), the holding company that owns Franklin Templeton Investments. Eight analysts recommend selling Franklin Resources, while six are neutral and none recommend buying, according to Refinitiv data."

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 12:31PM ET</span>",Battered Mexican construction sector hopes to exit slump in 2020,"By Sharay Angulo
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Major infrastructure projects recently announced by Mexico's government and the private sector could next year pull the construction industry out of a protracted slump, though the boost to the economy is unlikely to be significant.
Representing some 7.5% of total economic output, construction has contracted for 16 consecutive months, dragging down the economy which has stagnated this year.
If projects held up in the first year of the administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador start to take shape, construction output could grow by between 1% and 1.5% next year, said Eduardo Ramirez, president of industry association CMIC.
""The key thing is getting more private sector investment,"" he told Reuters. ""If we manage that, the coming year could be very good, and we can start reversing the numbers from 2019.""
Lopez Obrador, a leftist who took office in December 2018, has unsettled investors with some of his decisions, especially his cancellation of a partly built $13 billion Mexico City airport five weeks before he assumed the presidency.
Ever since he was elected in July of last year, construction output has declined, according to official data.
That set off the longest slump in the industry since the summer of 2014, prompting major companies such as cement maker Cemex to lower sales forecasts for this year.
Employment in the industry declined by 3.8% in the ten months through October, according to statistics agency INEGI.
So sharp was the slump that Mexican building firms Maquiobras and Construarba at one point had laid off about 90% of their staff in 2019, before business picked up in the second half, said Gustavo Arballo, chief executive of the companies.
Slowdowns are not unusual with a change of government in Mexico, and executives and analysts say the arrival of Lopez Obrador's new administration has put the brakes on the industry.
Still, late last month, the government announced the first phase of an ambitious infrastructure plan underwritten by the private sector worth some 859 billion pesos ($45 billion).
Public spending looks set to remain muted.
According to the CMIC, which represents around 12,000 building firms, as of September, only 31% of the budget had been spent for the 12 ministries and state-run companies that have traditionally dominated public sector construction.
The industry has pushed for bigger outlays on infrastructure next year, but the budget for the 12 entities in 2020 is 8.6% lower than the sum first approved for this year, the CMIC said.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to build a cheaper airport instead of the project canceled last year, as well as a new oil refinery in southern Mexico and a railway line connecting the tourist attractions of the Yucatan peninsula known as the Mayan Train.
Beyond that, few major projects have yet to appear.
""The main problem is that (the government) only has the refinery, the airport, the Mayan Train and some things with (state oil company) Pemex,"" said Jose Luis de la Cruz, director general of Mexico City-based economic think tank IDIC."
1253,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 12:16PM ET</span>",United Airlines pulls Boeing 737 MAX jets until early June,"By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) said on Friday it is extending cancellations of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX flights from early March until June 4, the longest that any U.S. carrier is scheduling without the grounded aircraft.
The decision follows comments from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that it still has nearly a dozen steps to complete before approving the jets for flight after a mid-March global safety ban in the wake of two fatal crashes. Reuters reported earlier U.S. officials do not expect the FAA to allow flights until at least February and it could slip to March.
Boeing said last week that it was freezing 737 production in January as the fallout from the two crashes, one in Indonesia and another in Ethiopia that killed a total 346 people, drags on.
Without the 737 MAX, United said it is cancelling about 56 flights a day in January and February, which tend to be slower travel months, with daily cancellations rising to 80 in March and April and 108 in May and the early part of June.
""With the MAX return to service date still unknown, pushing our timeline back to early June is what is best for our customers and our operation. By moving the return to service date back more than just a month - as we have done previously throughout 2019 - it allows us to have more certainty by providing our customers and our operation a firmer and more definitive timeline,"" United spokesman Frank Benenati said.
Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, the other two U.S. carriers that had 737 MAX jets in their fleets at the time of the grounding, are scheduling without the aircraft until early April.
Boeing said it deeply regrets ""the disruption that the 737 MAX grounding is causing our customers and their passengers. We are working with all of our customers to support them through this difficult time."""

1255,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 11:45AM ET</span>",Spirit AeroSystems to freeze parts production for 737 MAX as Boeing woes spread,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Boeing's top supplier Spirit AeroSystems Inc (N:SPR) said on Friday it would stop making fuselages for the grounded 737 MAX jets, the first major indication of disruption spreading to the planemaker's suppliers facing thousands of potential layoffs.
Shares of Spirit, which gets about 50% of its annual revenue from the 737 MAX, were down nearly 2% in morning trade. The stock has lost nearly 22% in value since the fatal Ethiopian airlines crash in March that led to the worldwide grounding of the MAX. 
""This suspension will have an adverse impact on Spirit's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows,"" the company said, adding it would halt production in January. Boeing (NYSE:BA) has also decided to temporarily stop MAX production next month.
The planemaker had so far shielded major MAX suppliers from a financial hit following the grounding, continuing to purchase parts from suppliers at a rate higher than its own, in order to keep the supply chain running and avoid major disruptions when the MAX returns to service.
Spirit has been churning out parts for the jet at a rate of up to 52 units per month, even as Boeing cut its own production to 42 per month earlier this year.
Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit said on Friday it was evaluating ""all potential actions to align its cost base with lower production levels expected in 2020"".
Earlier this week, Reuters reported that furloughs in Kansas were likely if Boeing stopped paying Spirit to build and store fuselages at current rates, as the planemaker looks to conserve cash.
Boeing's 737 MAX production freeze next year could also hurt  General Electric  (N:GE), which supplies the aircraft engines along with France's  Safran  SA (PA:SAF).
JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa, a long-time bear on GE said on Friday that there would be a ""major hole in growth"" for the U.S. industrial conglomerate that has ""likely taken in billions of advances"".
GE did not have any update in response to a Reuters request for comment.
Analysts and some of the smaller suppliers have warned that a MAX production halt could last up to six months or more, leading to widespread losses across the commercial aerospace supply chain around the world.

The uncertainty over the timing of the 737 MAX's return to service, loss of talent and the risk to the supply chain from the production halt, led ratings agencies to downgrade Boeing's debt ratings this week.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's competition watchdog on Friday fined Google (O:GOOGL) 150 million euros ($167 million) for abusing its dominant market position by applying opaque and unpredictable rules on its Google Ads advertising platform. 
It is the first penalty imposed by the French antitrust watchdog against the U.S. tech company, which faces a growing number of investigations into its business practices on both sides of the Atlantic.
Google said it would appeal the decision. 
The French regulator said it had found Google had a lack of objectivity and predictability in defining the rules on Google Ads, the gateway for advertisers that wish to appear in the sponsored section of search results. 
With a market share of around 90% in the online search business, Google has the responsibility to offer a fair access to Google Ads, the regulator said.
""One of the great principles of competition law is that with great power comes great responsibility,"" the head of the authority, Isabelle de Silva, said at a news conference.
""It's also Spider-Man's motto,"" she added, referring to the fictional superhero.
The authority's investigation took four years and followed a complaint filed by Gibmedia, a French company that manages a range of websites offering weather forecasts, corporate data and directories.
Gibmedia had accused Google of having suspended its Google Ads account without notice. 
The regulator said that by changing its terms of use and rules at will, Google had abused its market power. 
""The way the rules are applied give Google a power of life or death over some small businesses that live only on this kind of services,"" de Silva said. 
NO CLARITY
Google in response alleged that Gibmedia was running ads for websites that deceived people into paying for services on unclear billing terms. 
""We do not want these kinds of ads on our systems, so we suspended Gibmedia and gave up advertising revenue to protect consumers from harm,"" Google said in statement.
When contacted by Reuters, Gibmedia did not provide any immediate comment
In September, Google agreed to pay close to 1 billion euros to French authorities to settle a fiscal fraud probe that began four years ago.
In January, France's data protection watchdog had fined Google 50 million euros for breaching European Union online privacy rules.
The data protection watchdog stated in its January ruling that Google lacked transparency and clarity in the way it informed users about its handling of personal data, and had failed to properly obtain their consent for personalized ads.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian government's proposal to give up control of power company Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (SA:ELET6) via a capital increase cannot pass the Senate in its current form, the head of the upper house told reporters on Friday.
Senate President Davi Alcolumbre said the bill is opposed by 48 of 81 senators, with particular resistance from lawmakers representing northern and northeastern Brazil.
""If the government does not construct a new model, it won't pass the Senate,"" Alcolumbre said.
The plans to privatize Eletrobras, as the company is known, are part of the government's push to reduce state control over the economy and institute free-market reforms under right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.
Alcolumbre also said the Senate is unlikely to approve new taxes of any kind, following months of speculation that Economy Minister Paulo Guedes would push for a new tax on financial transactions."

LONDON (Reuters) - Giant listings by  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) and Alibaba (HK:9988) rescued a sluggish year for equity capital markets (ECM) in 2019 after a string of shelved initial public offerings (IPOs) and share price slumps. 
Proceeds from global equity capital markets (ECM) fell 4.7% to $659 billion in 2019, according to Refinitiv data, a figure propped up by state-owned oil giant Aramco's record-breaking $25.6 billion IPO and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's $13.5 billion secondary Hong Kong listing. 
The two deals accounted for 6% of the total raised, with Aramco alone accounting for 15% of global IPO volumes. 
""Aramco fits the category of large and differentiated deals for which there is an audience but equally it is such a unique asset and a unique situation that it is difficult to read across to other situations,"" said Gareth McCartney, head of Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) ECM syndicate at UBS.
(GRAPHIC: Global ECM volumes saved by marquee deals - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-IPOS/0H001QXR3B14/index.html) 
HARD WORK
U.S. office-sharing tech firm WeWork was the year's highest-profile casualty after its valuation tumbled from $47 billion in a private fundraising round in January to as low as $10-$12 billion for its proposed and then canceled IPO.  
Other notable cancellations included Reassure -- the UK arm of reinsurance group Swiss Re -- and Italian luxury yacht maker Ferretti.
Kirstin DeClark, co-head of U.S. equity capital markets at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), said poor share price performance by newly-listed tech firms meant investors were becoming more conservative about valuations for loss-making companies.
""The pendulum has swung much more towards discipline. Companies don't need to be profitable but there is much greater focus on the unit economics of a business,"" she said, referring to the underlying profitably of a company's core business. 
The cancellations also reflected a weakening global economy and political volatility, with Asian deals suffering from the anti-government protests in Hong Kong.
""If uncertainty created by the protests is prolonged, then it may have an impact on the decision to list in the longer term,"" said Janney Chong, equity capital market partner at law firm RPC.
Proceeds from Asia Pacific IPOs fell by nearly a fifth to $64.6 billion equivalent, though the Alibaba listing meant regional volumes were up 3.2% at $230.8 billion.
In Europe just $23.8 billion was raised, a 43.4% slide from 2018 and the lowest volume in seven years, leaving the United States as the only major region to top last year's IPO volumes.
Bumper listings by Uber Technologies (N:UBER) and rival  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) lifted proceeds there by 6.7% to $48.4 billion.
However, with their share prices languishing well below listing levels, many bankers believe the global ECM market could remain subdued in 2020 despite a healthy pipeline. 
GOING PRIVATE
The market also appears to be undergoing a structural change, with many companies, particularly tech ones, raising larger sums of money from venture capital and private equity investors, bankers said. 
""Increasingly, issuers and vendors have the opportunity to delay their IPOs...and give them another 1-2 years in the private market,"" said James Fleming, co-head of global equity capital markets at Citi. 
Private equity companies have raised record amounts of funds in recent years, while sovereign wealth funds have become increasingly active in global equity markets. Japanese investment company Softbank (T:9984) alone has more than $100 billion allocated to its Vision Fund and is in the process of raising another $100 billion for a second fund. 
A London-based capital markets lawyer said that while some challenges to the IPO market remain the same as previously, this was creating a new dimension. 

""When you brought a company to market ten years ago, you didn't have a $100 billion dollar fund competing for your attention,"" he said.

At least eight brokerages boosted their price target on the Dow-component's stock on Friday, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) making the most bullish move by raising it to $120, above Nike's current share price of about $100.
""Given Nike's significant scale and IT spend advantage, coupled with its early lead in digital, we remain very bullish on the company's ability to continue to maintain its momentum in digital,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Omar Saad.
Still, shares of the company were down about 1.5% in early trade as investors worried about its weak margins and growing competition in North America from Adidas (DE:ADSGn), Skechers (N:SKX) and VF Corp's (N:VFC) Vans.
In efforts to win market share from rivals, Nike has collaborated with celebrities, launched limited edition sneakers, spent on technology and increased marketing around major sporting events.
The company's sales have also got a boost in recent years from its ""Consumer Direct Offense"" strategy that includes focus on online sales, product launches and supply chain improvements to bring new products to shelves faster.
Overall, quarterly sales rose a better-than-expected 10.2%, with its famous Jordan brand hitting $1 billion in sales for the first time. North America sales rose 5%, but came in slightly below expectations.
The company's margins came under pressure in the quarter from increased investments, but several analysts attributed much of the weakness to currency fluctuations.
""Despite (the weak margins), Nike remains the envy of the rest of the sector,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell said.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 08:35AM ET</span>",Veteran watchdog Bailey to guide Bank of England through Brexit,"By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's new government named Andrew Bailey as the Bank of England's next boss on Friday, entrusting a veteran regulator and technocrat with steering the economy and its vast finance industry through Brexit.
During a 30-year stint at the BoE, Bailey helped shore up the banking system against the global financial crisis. Since 2016 he has led the industry's watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority.
Finance minister Sajid Javid called him ""the stand-out candidate"" as Britain maps out its future outside the EU, and he hailed Bailey's role in quelling the 2008-09 crisis.
""It is a tribute to his integrity and his character that he emerged from that... with his reputation enhanced in Whitehall, in the City of London and in financial capitals,"" Javid said.
Bailey, who has sought to present a neutral stance on Brexit, said he was honored to succeed Mark Carney ""particularly at such a critical time for the nation as we leave the European Union.""
Britain had delayed the appointment since 2018 as it focused on its tortuous EU departure and on an election emphatically won last week by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Bailey was an early front-runner for the job but as the announcement was pushed back, his chances seemed to have dimmed, with his critics accusing him of pulling his punches at the FCA.
Supporters say he knows how to use the BoE's sweeping powers without alienating bankers, and his financial crisis role makes him familiar to top officials at other major central banks.
""When he was in the room you were confident you had someone who was worth listening to and, importantly, also had the solution to what the problem might be,"" a former official involved in the crisis said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The 60-year-old will serve an eight-year term starting on March 16. Carney has delayed his scheduled Jan. 31 departure until then. 
STEADY, OR SLOW?
Bailey beat other candidates recently seen as more likely to get the BoE's top job - and its 495,000 pounds a year - including another former deputy governor, Minouche Shafik, who now heads the London School of Economics.
The Financial Times said Johnson rejected Shafik because of her critical views on Brexit.
Bailey is viewed as pro-European but routinely starts his speeches by saying the FCA takes no position on Brexit. He has also said Britain, home to Europe's largest financial center, must not become a ""taker"" of EU rules after it leaves the bloc.
Bailey ""should be an appointment that is above the political fray... a good choice, a steady choice,"" said Nomura economist George Buckley.
Bailey's ousted FCA predecessor Martin Wheatley had a reputation for plain speaking, leading to suggestions that then finance minister George Osborne forced him out to appoint someone less confrontational.
On Bailey's watch, the FCA last year fined Jes Staley, chief executive of  Barclays  (LON:BARC), 1.1 million pounds ($1.43 million) after he tried to identify a whistleblower. Lawmakers said the penalty was too lenient.
Bailey has also been criticized for not publishing in full a report into alleged misconduct by another British bank, RBS (LON:RBS). He cited privacy restrictions.
His chances of getting the BoE job were seen to have been further dented with the suspension of the Woodford equity fund, popular with retail clients who now face large losses.
Prominent anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller, who works for wealth management firm SCM Direct, accused Bailey of being too slow to stop the rot at Woodford.
""If you look at all the things on his watch, the culture has been to do things at the very last minute,"" she said.
Bailey has said the FCA's actions were limited by EU rules.
Born in the central English city of Leicester, his father was a school headmaster and his mother a magistrate ""so it’s no surprise I ended up like this,"" he told the Sunday Times in 2016, laughing at his low-key style which stands in contrast to the high-profile approach of Carney.
""Andrew Bailey doesn’t immediately make one think of Che Guevara,"" Sam Woods, a BoE deputy governor, said in 2016. ""But Andrew has been right at the forefront of the revolution in prudential regulation.""
Opposition Labour Party finance head John McDonnell called Bailey ""an establishment figure with what some consider is a less than inspiring record"" and said he would have to show quickly he could tackle Britain's economic problems.
Bailey helped the BoE contain fallout from the 1995 collapse of investment bank Barings and was private secretary to former governor Eddie George in the second half of the 1990s, when the BoE was given operational independence to set rates.
That experience should help Bailey counter questions about his lack of experience on monetary policy. He could also take advice from his American wife, Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey, an author and editor of several books on monetary policy and trade.

7::55 AM ET:   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) shares fell 1.2% after the company posted a 32% increase in profit in its fiscal second quarter, thanks to a 20% rise in sales in China and a 5% rise in revenue from North America. The increases were achieved in the face of a sales dispute with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and a major doping scandal at a track and field program sponsored by Nike.
Flat apparel sales in North America were a minor disappointment, while the strength of the Chinese business is to some extent a double-edged sword, illustrating how much it depends on a country that still has unfinished business with the U.S. on trade.
The figures are the last to be presented by CEO Mark Parker, who is stepping down next month to be succeeded by John Donahoe.

Royal Dutch Shell's ADRs (NYSE:RDSa) fell 0.9% after Europe’s oil and gas major warned it may write down up to $2.3 billion in assets in the fourth quarter due to well write-offs, decommissioning costs and other factors.

In a trading update, the company also indicated gas output would be lower than forecast for the current quarter, but oil production would be around 2.8 million barrels a day, at the top end of its guided range.
Shell (LON:RDSa) said that chemicals and gasoline marketing margins would be weaker due to seasonality and crude price fluctuations.
The company added that capital expenditure for the full year will be at the bottom end of the guided range of $24-$29 billion.

8 AM ET: CarMax (NYSE:KMX) stock fell 5.6% after the used car dealership network reported earnings per share 10% below market consensus at $1.04.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 08:22AM ET</span>",Shell writes down up to $2.3 billion on weaker economic outlook,"By Ron Bousso and Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) said on Friday it expected to write down up to $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter, the latest major energy company forced to shrink estimates for sector values due to a weaker economic outlook.
In a trading update ahead of full year results, Shell also lowered its oil products sales forecast, pointing to the first annual slowdown in sales since at least 2014, while maintaining spending on the lower end of forecasts.
The Anglo-Dutch company warned in October that trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's two largest energy consumers, could hurt demand and take a toll on its performance.
Shell said it expected to take post-tax impairment charges in a range between $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion for the quarter ""based on the macro outlook"". It did not say which assets the impairments relate to.
Since October, rivals Chevron (N:VCX),  BP  (L:BP), Equinor and Spain's Repsol (MC:REP) all wrote down a total of around $20 billion, primarily in U.S. shale gas assets due to lower long-term gas prices.
The impairment will likely increase Shell's debt ratio, or gearing, which the company has struggled to reduce in recent years.
""This reduction in guidance and impairment appears to show that management underestimated how much weaker oil prices would be in the latter part of this year, as well as underestimating future demand for oil, along with its by-products,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market Analyst at CMC Markets UK.
Its shares were down 1.1% by 1145 GMT, compared with slight gains on the broader European energy index (SXEP).
Shell, which had beaten third-quarter profit expectations on strong oil and gas trading, also warned that higher taxes would hit earnings by about $500 million to $600 million in the fourth quarter.
The company said it expected additional well write-offs in the range of $100 million to $200 million in the period, while 2019 capital expenditure was expected to be at the lower end of its guidance range of $24 billion to $29 billion.

(GRAPHIC: Shell chemical sales - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/7842/7824/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Shell gave guidance for oil product sales of 6.5 million to 7 million barrels per day (bpd) in the fourth quarter, compared with its earlier estimate of 6.65 million bpd to 7.05 million bpd. That would mark the first decline in sales since at least 2014.
Chemical sales were expected to reach 3.4 million to 3.6 million tonnes, marking a sharp slowdown in 2019 compared to the previous five years.
Production of oil and gas is expected to be higher from the third quarter, while liquefied natural gas (LNG) volumes are in line with previous forecasts at between 8.8 million and 9.4 million tonnes.
Shell reports fourth quarter results on Jan. 30.

MONTREAL/TORONTO (Reuters) - A Canadian union is taking the unusual step of pursuing contempt of court charges against Canada's second-largest railroad, in a previously unreported case that escalates the debate over working hours for railroad employees, according to two sources and legal documents.
The Teamsters union argued in court filings that  Canadian Pacific Railway  (TO:CP) should face contempt fines of C$50,000 ($37,591.16) a day for making its conductors and locomotive engineers stay late, despite an arbitrator's decision that ends duty after their shifts. 
The case, which has been filed in Federal Court in Toronto, is expected to go to court in 2020, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because the dispute is still wading its way through the legal system. No date has been set.
In an emailed statement to Reuters, Calgary-based CP denied that it failed to comply with the arbitrator's 2018 order, adding it is ""vigorously defending"" its claim and believes the case should be resolved outside of court.
Workers' shifts and fatigue emerged as key issues in November during a crippling, eight-day strike at Canadian National Railway (TO:CNR), which ended with an agreement-in-principle set to be finalized in late January. 
The recording of an exhausted conductor facing pressure to move a freight train following his 10 hour shift helped spur a breakthrough in the negotiations. [nL1N2860EO][nL1N2860YL]
Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau is reviewing rail industry proposals submitted this week to introduce new work-rest rules for railway employees, as part of broader efforts by North American regulators to fight fatigue. 
CP said in the emailed statement that the parties are currently ""working to resolve a host of procedural issues"" in the case. 
Mixing arbitration and the courts is a departure from the normal practice of separating the two fields, following a 1995 Supreme Court of Canada decision on the matter, a human resources expert said.
""It would be very uncommon,"" said Rafael Gomez, Director of the Centre for Industrial Relations and Human Resources at the University of Toronto. 
CP argued that federal court is the wrong forum to hear ""complex operational issues"" like the ones in the case.
The TCRC and Canada's large railways have clashed for years over working hours in the 24-hour, mostly on-call industry serving far flung locations, where delays are common because of bad weather and congestion. 
""These issues can and should be dealt with through the processes already provided for under the collective agreement between the parties,"" CP said.
The Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, which declined comment, argued in the June 2019 filing that CP left it no other choice but to go to court.
""The union has now been forced to seek this contempt motion because the violations continue to occur hundreds of times every month,"" said the TCRC, which represents thousands of Canadian rail workers.
The union said it identified 6,215 violations of workers' rest provisions between the publication of the arbitrator's order on March 23, 2018, and December 19, 2018. 
CP's unionized locomotive engineers and conductors can book rest within 10 hours if they give proper notice, and can be off duty within 12 hours, barring extenuated circumstances outside the railway's control, such as bad weather.
Rail workers in Canada and the United States can work a maximum of 12 hours, according to regulations in each country. 
While arbitrator Graham Clark did not side fully with the union or CP, his March 2018 decision issued a cease and desist order after ""CP's own evidence indicated that thousands of situations continue to occur annually where employees are not off within 10 hours.""
Most of the workers were kept less than an hour late. 
""The health and safety of the union's members (and the public), maximum hours of work and their right to book rest if they are fatigued, is of paramount concern,"" the union said in the 2019 filing.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks touched record highs on Friday, as trading wound down before the year-end holidays, while the British pound was heading toward its worst week for more than two years amid renewed worries over how Britain will leave the European Union. 
MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, gained a smidgeon to 561.31, bettering a record scaled on Thursday as optimism infused markets after the United States and China agreed an initial trade deal. 
The MSCI index is on track to advance more than 1% this week, in what would be its fourth straight week of gains.
European shares led the way, with the broad Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) gaining ground through the morning to add 0.6%. Indexes in Frankfurt (GDAXI), Paris (FCHI) and London (FTSE) all made similar gains in thin trading.
Yet Shell (L:RDSa) shares fell 1.1% after it said it expected impairment charges of up to $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter due to a weaker economic outlook.
On Wall Street, futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) were flat near all-time highs, having risen more than 1% in the week.
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) added a sliver, having risen 1.2% so far this week and almost 5% this month.
Underscoring that the trade war issue has been put to bed for now, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the United States and China would sign their so-called phase one trade pact in early January.
Mnuchin said the documentation was completely finished and just undergoing a technical ""scrub"", though Beijing has so far dodged all details of the deal.
The U.S. House of Representatives also overwhelmingly approved a new North American deal that leaves $1.2 trillion in annual U.S.-Mexico-Canada tradeflows largely intact.
Market players were already beginning to look at what the next steps for the Washington-Beijing saga will be in the new year. 
""The focus will be on what the outlook is on a more comprehensive phase two deal - what the language is like, what Trump and the Chinese are saying about it,"" said Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com.
Wall Street investors had on Thursday pushed the S&P 500 (SPX) to a sixth straight record, its longest such streak since January 2018. All three major U.S. indexes - S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow - notched record closing highs. (N)
Still, some data reminded investors of the fragile state of the world economy. 
The mood among German consumers deteriorated unexpectedly heading into January, a survey showed, suggesting that household spending in Europe's largest economy could weaken at the beginning of next year.
POUND IN PERIL
On the currency front, sterling steadied after suffering a sharp reversal that left it facing its worst weekly fall since late 2017 of around 2%.
Former Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey will be the central bank's next governor, Britain's finance minister said. Bailey will serve an eight-year term, with investors expecting continuity on monetary policy.
The pound was up 0.2% at $1.3029  having slipped overnight to below $1.30, a dramatic drop from a $1.3514 peak, after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson used his sweeping election victory to revive the risk of a hard Brexit.
""We see the biggest risks being to GBP/USD depreciation over the next two weeks as Brexit preparations take place amidst the most sluggish UK economy in 10 years,"" said Richard Grace, chief currency strategist at CBA.
The British parliament will vote at around 1430 GMT on Johnson's Brexit deal.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar edged up 0.2% to 97.530 (DXY) and was set for its best week in a month.

1270,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 06:46AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Huawei and Deutsche Telekom held advanced talks over 5G network deal - sources,"By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom was in advanced talks to retain China's Huawei as its main supplier of radio equipment for new mobile networks before it put the negotiations on hold for political reasons, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
The United States has urged its allies to freeze out the Chinese supplier over cybersecurity concerns. Washington has told allies that the company's equipment could be used by China as spying tools, an allegation denied by Huawei and Beijing.
Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), Europe's largest telecoms operator, announced last week that it was not entering into 5G network equipment contracts as it awaited the resolution of a political debate in Berlin over whether to restrict Huawei's access to the German market.
Before that announcement, Deutsche Telekom had held discussions with Huawei [HWT.UL] in Paris and hammered out terms for a possible deal, though no contract was signed, said the sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
In response to Reuters questions about talks with Huawei, a Deutsche Telekom spokesman confirmed that no deal or arrangement had been reached about making the Chinese company its main supplier of 5G network equipment.
Before the talks were put on hold, the sources said that the two sides had discussed key terms which envisioned that Huawei would provide 70% of radio transmission gear for Deutsche Telekom's upcoming ultra-fast 5G networks for a price of 533 million euros ($587 million). 
A mechanism was also worked out that, should Huawei's share of the 5G equipment provision fall due to any move by the Berlin government to limit Chinese involvement, the amount the company would be paid would fall proportionately, the sources said. 
The Paris discussions took place last month, when Deutsche Telekom held talks with Huawei as well as with other potential vendors of 5G network equipment, according to the sources. 
Subsequently, on Dec. 3, senior executives from the German and Chinese companies held a meeting at Frankfurt Airport, said the sources. Claudia Nemat, a Deutsche Telekom management board member and its top technology executive, and Huawei Deputy Chairman Eric Xu attended the meeting, they added.
The Deutsche Telekom spokesman confirmed the meetings took place in Frankfurt and Paris but said negotiations about all transactions had been suspended while the Berlin government, which owns 32% of the telecom operator, decided on official policy regarding Huawei. 
He added the purpose of the Dec. 3 meeting was to inform Huawei that talks were on hold. 
Huawei declined to comment on its discussions with Deutsche Telekom.
CARRIER COMPLEXITIES
The talks and their subsequent suspension highlight the complexities and disruption facing carriers around the world as they try to move forward with 5G networks, which will enable much higher wireless internet speeds. 
Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of mobile network gear, and has been used by Deutsche Telekom and many other of the world's biggest telecom operators to provide the bulk of their existing 3G and 4G network infrastructure.
The discussions between Deutsche Telekom and Huawei covered only 5G radio gear, according to the sources, not equipment for the more sensitive network ""core"" which is the main focus of security concerns for telecoms operators and governments.
Radio equipment consists of the antennas mounted on masts and base stations, providing mobile service coverage, while core infrastructure manages calls and data traffic across the network.
Deutsche Telekom, Huawei's largest European customer, has not announced a decision on suppliers for its core. 
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government delayed a decision on security rules for 5G networks until next year.
Merkel has not singled out Huawei, but some lawmakers in her coalition government have called for the Chinese company to be subject to tougher measures than others, ranging from curbing its market share to 50% to an outright ban.

(Reuters) -  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) has secured Medicaid coverage for a pricey new sickle cell disease therapy in two U.S. states just weeks after winning U.S. approval, following an early campaign to convince local officials of its value, according to a company executive and a Reuters review of public filings. The approvals from the Florida and Alabama Medicaid health programs for the poor and disabled mark exceptionally fast acceptance for the treatment, which can cost up to $113,000 annually for an individual patient, excluding discounts, said Ameet Mallik, who heads the Swiss drugmaker's oncology division.
In November, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Adakveo and Global Blood Therapeutic Inc's (O:GBT) Oxbryta, which carries a list price of $125,000 per year.
They are among the first therapies that aim to provide significant relief from painful symptoms or address the cause of sickle cell disease, a potentially lethal ailment in which deformed blood cells limit the oxygen supply to parts of the body.
Strong uptake by Medicaid programs is central to Novartis' goal of making Adakveo a $1 billion drug, since a high percentage of sickle cell patients rely on the state-run health programs. Analysts at Cowen & Co forecast peak annual U.S. Oxbryta sales reaching $1.7 billion.
GBT spokesman Steven Immergut said some health plans, including private insurers as well as government-run Medicaid and Medicare, have started to cover Oxbryta on a case-by-case basis. The company said it has received positive feedback from payers in early discussions.
Depending on the state, Medicaid can take as long as 12-to-18 months to approve new medications, particularly expensive ones that put a strain on state budgets. GBT has said it expects most Medicaid programs to take at least three-to-six months to approve its drugs.
The majority of the nearly 100,000 people in the United States with sickle cell anemia are African American. Around 85 percent of sickle cell patients live in 17 U.S. states, including Florida and Alabama, and more than half are insured either by Medicare or Medicaid, according to Novartis and GBT.
'HISTORIC TIME FOR THE SICKLE CELL COMMUNITY' Adakveo is a biologic drug injected into patients several times each month to prevent the pain crises often associated with sickle cell disease.
Oxbryta is a once daily pill that treats the disease's underlying cause by raising hemoglobin levels and preventing the breakdown of red blood cells into a sickle - or crescent moon - shape.
Their different impacts on the disease has raised the prospect that both drugs would be prescribed simultaneously, creating a greater cost burden to the U.S. healthcare systems. Florida approved the Novartis drug with a requirement that patients receive prior authorization from their physician, Mallik said, meaning that the state would review any prescriptions to make sure that patients meet certain criteria. Alabama approved it without restrictions, he added. Although state Medicaid programs cannot simply refuse to cover FDA-approved drugs, they can attempt to save money by moving slowly to place the drug on reimbursement formularies or by requiring patients to go through extra steps to obtain reimbursement. A Novartis cancer therapy, Kymriah, which costs as much as $475,000, is still not covered by Medicaid in every state despite having been approved two years ago, Mallik said.
Both Novartis and GBT began meeting with state Medicaid officials ahead of the FDA approvals to discuss the treatment and have advocated for its inclusion on formularies, or official reimbursement lists, both companies told Reuters.
""We have been meeting with both government and commercial payers for several months – initially educating about sickle hemoglobin polymerization and, more recently, about Oxbryta,"" Immergut said. Patient advocacy groups, such as the state-level chapters of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America (SCDAA), also are meeting with policymakers to encourage them to make the drug accessible to patients, said Biree Andemariam, the group's chief medical officer.
""This is a really historic time for the sickle cell community,"" she said. ""Patients are ready to take advantage of these new treatments."""

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 05:23AM ET</span>",French telco Orange and ex-CEO found guilty over workers' suicides,"By Simon Carraud
PARIS (Reuters) - French telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN) and its former CEO Didier Lombard were guilty of ""moral harassment"" that prompted a spate of suicides during a restructuring at the company in the late 2000s, a court ruled on Friday.
The court sentenced Lombard to a year in jail, of which eight months was suspended, and a 15,000 euros ($16,680.00) fine in a landmark ruling.
The traumatic episode of workers' deaths at the company, then known as  France Telecom , in the late 2000s, led to deeep soul-searching over corporate culture in France. 
The court also found Orange guilty of the same charge, and fined it 75,000 euros.
The guilty verdict against Lombard and the company will reverberate in French and European boardrooms as it sets a precedent for big business and could pave the way for other similar collective procedures in France.
Orange has previously acknowledged the suffering expressed by victims and recognised there may have been management errors in implementing the restructuring plan but denies there was any systemic plan or intention to harass employees.
Prosecutors argued that some of the methods employed in a deep restructuring of the company, then known as France Telecom, after privatisation triggered a wave of suicides. 
Orange has said it acknowledges the suffering expressed by victims and recognises there may have been management errors in implementing the restructuring plan but denies there was any systemic plan or intention to harass employees.
Lombard, 77, had denied wrongdoing.
Three other former Orange executives also accused of ""moral harassment"" have also denied responsibility. The executives said the restructuring plan was an economic necessity.
The former telecoms monopoly used the last day of the trial in July to offer compensation to victims and relatives of those who died. The presiding judge estimated that claims for compensation so far amounted to about 2 million euros ($2.25 million).
The case centres around a drive by the former state monopoly to shed 22,000 jobs and redeploy another 10,000 as it adapted to competition in the private sector.
In a country where workers employed on state contracts expect jobs for life and employees in both private and public sectors enjoy strong labour law protection, unions alleged that management sought ways to encourage workers to quit or accept reassignment.
A 2010 report by labour inspectors said management used ""pathogenic"" restructuring methods such as forcing people into new jobs in far away cities and giving them unattainable performance objectives.
Prosecutors listed at least 18 suicides and 13 suicide attempts between April 2008 and June 2010. According to union records, one employee stabbed himself in the stomach during a staff meeting and one woman threw herself out of a window.

Investing.com -- The battle for   Just Eat   (LON:JE) is going down to the wire.
The two companies bidding for the U.K.-based online restaurant platform both increased their offers on Thursday, ahead of a December 27th deadline for shareholders to signal which (if either) of the two bids they want to accept.
That pushed Just Eat’s stock briefly to a five-month high on Thursday, although it had settled into a range around the 800 pence a share mark by mid-morning in London.
That level of 800p corresponds exactly to the improved cash offer from   Prosus   (AS:PRX), the Internet holding company spun off by South Africa’s   Naspers Ltd   (JO:NPNJn). Prosus on Thursday raised its offer from an initial bid of 710p.
However, Just Eat’s board has so far favored the rival approach from Dutch-based Takeaway.Com (AS:TKWY), whose offer, while notionally higher, is an all-stock one.
Takeaway had initially offered Just Eat shareholders 52.1% of the combined group, but on Thursday improved that offer to 57.5%. That translates into a price of 916p at Thursday’s closing price for Takeaway.
For investors, it boils down to a choice between hard cash up front from Prosus and the promise of further growth from Takeaway. Cat Rock Capital, which owns 3% of Just Eat and is also a shareholder in Takeaway, has thrown its weight behind the latter, calling it a “fantastic win-win” for shareholders of both Takeaway and Just Eat.
 “Just Eat shareholders will meaningfully participate in the tremendous upside of the combined business, while Takeaway.com shareholders significantly increase the scale of their company at a compelling value,” Cat Rock founder Alex Captain said in a statement. “Takeaway.com is buying a business with over 2.5x its revenue at approximately 50% of its own valuation.”
Although the tweak to the exchange ratio has weighed on Takeaway’s share price in the last 24 hours – it’s fallen to 78.80 euros from 88.90 before the announcement - Cat Rock’s Captain said the shares had 50% upside over the next 12 months, using a historic average multiple of 7.5 times forward revenue.
Prosus, by contrast, warns that the share prices of both fail to reflect the heavy investment needed to roll out fuller delivery services. That warning that assumes the European market will follow the U.S. one in forcing high-margin platform-only companies to incorporate delivery into their offerings, permanently raising their cost bases and squeezing their margins.
It cites the doleful experience of Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) as proof. Grubhub's shares fell over 40% in October after it issued a profit warning, although they have recouped more than half of those losses since.
Takeaway and Just Eat reject the parallel.

Britain's biggest mortgage lender has struggled to contain the fallout from a fraud at Halifax Bank of Scotland's branch in Reading, which led to six people being jailed in 2017.
The scam involved small business customers being targeted and referred to a consultancy in return for bribes including designer watches, sex with prostitutes and foreign holidays.
A review by a retired judge into the bank's compensation scheme, which totalled 102 million pounds ($133 million), found it showed an 'unacceptable denial of responsibility' for victims' suffering and likely paid some too little. [nL8N28K3J4]
Lloyds said it would re-assess victims' claims and this week offered the special payments due to the additional delay, a Lloyds spokesman said.
A spokesman for campaign group the SME Alliance confirmed the offer, which totals 6.685 million pounds.
Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds, has also met with some victims.
""A common concern expressed by customers, as well other stakeholders, during recent meetings has been that a re-review will take time and this creates further delays and distress for them. We have listened to these concerns and are very sorry for this,"" the Lloyds spokesman said.
The special payments offer was earlier reported by the Financial Times.

The statement on fourth-quarter earnings published on Friday comes after Shell’s previous set of bumper profits was overshadowed by a warning about the pace of share buybacks. It’s only the second time the company has issued such guidance, which was a response to criticism about the unpredictability of its financial results.
Shell also indicated that post-tax impairment charges in the final three months of the year would be between $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion, based on the macroeconomic outlook. These so-called “identified items” totaled $1.3 billion in the third quarter.
Last week,   Chevron   Corp (NYSE:CVX) said it expects to write down as much as $11 billion for assets including shale-gas holdings in the U.S. Natural Gas prices in the country are on course for the lowest annual average in two decades, forcing producers to consider revaluing what many of the fields are worth.
Shell warned in October that the worsening economy could slow the pace of returns to shareholders, prompting a negative reaction from investors despite the company comfortably beating even the highest analyst profit estimate for the third quarter. Friday’s statement also gave a relatively downbeat assessment of the market.
“Trading and optimization performance is expected to be average” in the company’s integrated gas unit, according to the statement. In the marketing business “margins are expected to be lower due to seasonal trends, and weaker compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to crude price movements.”
The company’s B shares slipped 0.7% to 2,257 pence as of 8:14 a.m. in London.
Upstream production will range from 2.775 million to 2.825 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the fourth quarter, Shell said. Integrated gas output will be between 920,000 and 970,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, with gas-liquefaction volumes of 8.8 million to 9.4 million tons.
Shell is scheduled to publish fourth-quarter results on Jan. 30."

Two video-streaming channels from cartoon-focused Bilibili (O:BILI) and Alibaba-backed (N:BABA) Youku will be added for a total of four. Owners will also be able to entertain themselves with three online games - mahjong and two versions of poker from Chinese tech-giant Tencent (HK:0700).

The court fined Volkswagen a record A$125 million ($86 million) for breaching Australian consumer law by making false representations about compliance with the country's diesel emissions standards.
The settlement follows revelations that Volkswagen was using prohibited engine-control software to pass pollution tests. The company has already paid billions of dollars in legal costs around the world.
ACCC Chair Rod Sims told reporters on Friday that the fine imposed on Volkswagen was just a taste of what companies could expect in the future.
The agency would use its new expanded powers to punish illegal activity with the largest fines possible and penalties of more than A$100 million would not be unusual, he said.
Volkswagen did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Separately, the country's corporate watchdog, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), said it started civil penalty proceedings in a federal court against Volkswagen Financial Services Australia Pty Ltd for allegedly not making appropriate checks before giving out 49,380 loans to consumers.
ASIC alleges that the unit, which operates nationally to provide borrowers with consumer loans to purchase new and used cars, did not make required inquiries into borrowers' living expenses or if the loans were unsuitable for them.
These instances of alleged breaches in lending laws occurred between Dec. 20, 2013 and Dec. 15, 2016, ASIC said. The maximum penalty for one contravention equates to A$1.7 million ($1.2 million) in the period till July 31, 2015, and to A$1.8 million for a contravention in the period after that, the watchdog said.
ASIC said proceedings commence on a date to be determined by the court.
A spokeswoman for the unit said it takes its compliance obligations seriously and that it was cooperating with ASIC.

(This story corrects paragraph two to clarify that VW was penalized for breaching Australian law and that the fine is not to settle lawsuits brought on behalf of Australian customers affected by the emissions issue. The company has reached in-principle settlements on those lawsuits)

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 03:11AM ET</span>",U.S. government study finds racial bias in facial recognition tools,"By Jan Wolfe and Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - Many facial recognition systems misidentify people of color more often than white people, according to a U.S. government study released on Thursday that is likely to increase skepticism of technology widely used by law enforcement agencies.
The study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found that, when conducting a particular type of database search known as ""one-to-one"" matching, many facial recognition algorithms falsely identified African-American and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more than Caucasian faces.
The study also found that African-American females are more likely to be misidentified in ""one-to-many"" matching, which can be used for identification of a person of interest in a criminal investigation.
While some companies have played down earlier findings of bias in technology that can guess an individual's gender, known as ""facial analysis,"" the NIST study was evidence that face matching struggled across demographics, too.
Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, called the report ""a comprehensive rebuttal"" of those saying artificial intelligence (AI) bias was no longer an issue. The study comes at a time of growing discontent over the technology in the United States, with critics warning it can lead to unjust harassment or arrests.
For the report, NIST tested 189 algorithms from 99 developers, excluding companies such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) that did not submit one for review. What it tested differs from what companies sell, in that NIST studied algorithms detached from the cloud and proprietary training data.
China's SenseTime, an AI startup valued at more than $7.5 billion, had ""high false match rates for all comparisons"" in one of the NIST tests, the report said.
SenseTime's algorithm produced a false positive more than 10% of the time when looking at photos of Somali men, which, if deployed at an airport, would mean a Somali man could pass a customs check one in every 10 times he used passports of other Somali men.
SenseTime did not immediately return a request for comment.
Yitu, another AI startup from China was more accurate and had little racial skew.
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) had almost 10 times more false positives for women of color than men of color in some instances during a one-to-many test. Its algorithm showed little discrepancy in a one-to-many test with photos just of black and white males.
Microsoft said it was reviewing the report and did not have a comment on Thursday evening.
Congressman Bennie Thompson, chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security, said the findings of bias were worse than feared, at a time when customs officials are adding facial recognition to travel checkpoints.
""The administration must reassess its plans for facial recognition technology in light of these shocking results,"" he said."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Foreign investors are on their longest spell of buying Chinese stocks this year, increasing their bets on the mainland markets as Beijing and Washington prepare to resolve a long-running trade war.
That has turned the fortunes around for Chinese technology shares. The sector, which was facing steady selling pressure last year, is now at fresh highs as overseas investors continue to buy into China's A-share market for 26 straight sessions. 
Beijing's steps to build its own tech capabilities, including the July launch of the Nasdaq-style STAR Market have been an additional reason luring foreign investors into China's tech sector. 
That is despite lingering concerns over Washington's scrutiny and blacklisting of Chinese tech companies such as telecoms giant Huawei [HWT.UL] and some leading AI firms.

1285,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 02:46AM ET</span>","Premarket London: Shell Raises Oil Output Forecast, Sees Write-Offs","Investing.com -- Here is a summary of the most important regulatory news releases from the London Stock Exchange on Friday, 20th December. Please refresh for updates.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) said it expected impairment charges of up to $2.3 billion in the current quarter, due to well write-offs and decommissioning costs, among other things. 
It trimmed its overall output forecast to 6.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day but said oil output will be in a range between 2.775 million and 2.825 million barrels a day. The midpoint of that range is the very top end of the range it had forecast three months ago.


However, it said it expected between $100-$200 million in well write-offs and the same amount in other decommissioning costs to hit its fourth-quarter report. It also shaved its forecast for refinery availability to a range around 89.5% from a a midpoint of 92% previously.
It reiterated that full-year capital expenditure will be at the lower end of its $24 to $29 billion range.

It also said it expected chemical cracker margins to be “materially lower” than the third quarter due to the weak macroeconomic backdrop. Gasoline marketing margins will be down due to seasonal effects and crude price movements.

AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) said it will sell the commercial rights to its breast and prostate cancer drugs Arimidex (anastrozole) and Casodex (bicalutamide) in a number of European, African and other countries1 to Juvisé Pharmaceuticals, for an up-front payment of $181 million.
Juvise will pay up to an additional $17 million contingent on future sales of the drugs, which have lost their patent protection.

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 02:29AM ET</span>",Dismal decade for emerging markets casts pall over repeated 'buy' notes,"By Tom Arnold and Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - One of the hardiest investment fixtures has been the annual 'buy' note on emerging markets equities, but their dismal performance over the past decade begs the question why.
With the United States and China poised to seal an initial trade deal, the chances of a global recession receding, and U.S. equities soaring to record levels, many investment firms are once again turning positive on emerging markets for 2020.
That seems logical in a low-growth, low-yielding developed world, where underlying bullishness about equities may reasonably be guided toward relatively high dividend and growth stocks in a grouping of developing economies now accounting for around 60% of global economic activity and expected to be the main engine of what little growth there is around.
But the re-emergence of the seasonal cheer toward emerging markets doesn't wash as easily as it once did and contrasts with the rest of the year, in which returns on emerging market stocks have disappointed - less than half those of Wall St's S&P 500 (SPX) and more than 10 percentage points below MSCI's all-country world index.
Some bets go wrong once in a while. But it's been like this for emerging markets for much of the past decade.
In every year apart from 2010 and 2017, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MSCIEF) has trundled in behind the plain vanilla U.S. benchmark index, raising questions as to why advisers continually push ostensibly higher-risk markets that reap poorer returns.
""This time of the year, every single year, you get the same people...trotting out the same argument as to why you should buy emerging markets,"" said John-Paul Smith of emerging market consultancy Ecstrat, who has correctly called the underperformance of emerging stocks from the end of 2010.
HIGH RISK WITHOUT THE REWARD?
Once dismissed as “casinos” because of their volatile economics and politics and frequent illiquidity, emerging markets have sucked in an estimated $50 billion annually in foreign equity flows since that term for lower and middle-income countries was first coined 38 years ago.
That investment has helped emerging economies develop, with at least some of that cash ploughed into infrastructure, local business and public services.
For much of their early years, emerging markets proved the brightest stars in the global asset class galaxy - surpassing the S&P 500 up until the 2008 global financial crisis.
But the last decade has been more subdued.
Investors broadly give three big reasons for that. A stronger dollar, due in part to U.S. attempts to dial down stimulus in the wake of the 2008 banking crash, has acted as a headwind for further migration of still-dominant western private savings pools toward emerging markets.
More tepid global growth has also magnified a slowdown in China - whose explosive expansion from 2000 was the supercycle of the previous decade but which has since dragged on all emerging economies.
Thirdly, the failure of globalization to fully recover from the 2008 banking crash and recession - evident in a rash of protectionist politics, civil unrest and faltering trade - has weakened the underlying 30-year investment thesis.
""In this environment trade has suffered,"" said Ian Hargreaves, co-head of Asia and emerging market equities at Invesco. ""Given the correlation between exports growth and corporate earnings for EM companies, this has had a negative impact.""
KEEPING THE FAITH?
Nevertheless, heading into 2020, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) - the world's largest asset manager - is overweight on emerging market equities. Amundi Asset Management, Europe's largest, is ""moderately more constructive"" on the asset class. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), the U.S.'s largest bank, is modestly overweight, while HSBC Asset Management, part of Europe's largest bank, is overweight too.
Many within the industry were similarly positive going into 2019 and in many recent years. BlackRock and HSBC Asset Management were overweight this time last year, Amundi was neutral, while JPMorgan expected emerging market stocks to deliver double-digit appreciation - which they have done, just almost half the amount you would have got at home in Boston, London, Paris or Frankfurt.
""The fund management industry push the emerging markets largely for reasons of self-interest because the margins are so much higher,"" said Smith.

STRUCTURAL CHANGES
Their poor performance is raising broader questions about the structure of stock market indexes like MSCI's, the most-widely used emerging market index, with around 1,100 constituents from 26 countries.
Such indexes should begin to encompass U.S. giants such as Boeing (N:BA), Coca-Cola (N:KO) or  Chevron  (N:CVX) as emerging markets begin to account for a larger chunk of their profits, said veteran emerging market investor Mark Mobius. Developed market stocks are not currently included, although MSCI does offer separate indexes which cover such stocks with high exposure to emerging markets.
""You can continue to say emerging market countries are in the lower and middle-income bracket but if a company has more than 50% of its earnings in emerging markets it should be defined as an emerging market company,"" said Mobius, founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners.
Some emerging market companies have performed well over the past decade. South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), for example, has shot up more than 300%, although still less than Apple (O:AAPL) and Microsoft (O:MSFT).
For a graphic on Dismal decade for emerging market stocks, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/10110/10021/EM2.png
MSCI says its framework for classifying markets into emerging and developed is supported by evidence showing that splits based on development and geography resulted in correlation clusters, allowing investors to seek out diversity.
""Superior economic growth has resulted in positive market returns historically, low correlation within emerging markets and across asset classes has provided diversification benefits, and relative scarcity of information has created opportunities for active portfolio management,"" said Dimitris Melas, MSCI's global head of core equity research.
Melas points out that emerging markets have outperformed since the launch of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in December 1987.
INVESTMENT BOOM
The 80s were the start of an investment boom in emerging markets, which gained traction after the IFC’s Antoine van Agtmael pitched a fund investing in such markets in a meeting at investment bank Salomon Brothers in New York. He piqued the interest of those present but doubts surfaced about the proposed name “Third World Equity Fund,” a term that connoted poverty and hopelessness.
Agtmael coined emerging markets, instead. Soon the likes of Franklin Templeton and Capital Group were dipping their toes in the asset class, at the vanguard of a growing wall of investment.
""It still makes sense to group together the lower-income end of the global investment universe and it has not stopped 'emerging',"" said Agtmael. ""In fact, it may be bigger and more attractive than ever now that it is no longer 'hyped'.""
Emerging markets remain a growing part of the global economy with a rising middle class, unlike the U.S., he notes.
Fund managers are split about the asset class's fortunes over the next decade.
Ecstrat's Smith remains downbeat, worrying in particular about the risk of a blow-up among ""too big to fail"" state-linked firms in China.
Others are more positive.
""In the last three months emerging markets have outperformed the S&P 500,"" said Mobius. ""We may be seeing a return to emerging markets mainly because of this low interest rate environment. People are searching for yield.""
But if that yield is drowned by repeated capital loss, illiquidity or excessive volatility, the burden of proof will climb further."

The vaccine was used by the World Health Organization and Democratic Republic of the Congo as an investigational vaccine to help reduce Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in few West African countries from 2014 to 2016.
The Ebola virus, which causes haemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids, has killed more than 2,100 people in Congo since the middle of the year, making it the second-largest Ebola outbreak in history.
The vaccine, which is administered as a single-dose injection, will help to prevent EVD caused by Zaire ebolavirus in patients aged 18 years and older, the regulator said in a statement.
Merck welcomed the FDA's decision, describing it as an important milestone in the fight against the deadly virus.
In November, Merck received approval from the European Commission to market Ervebo, less than a month after a European medicines panel backed the first-ever vaccine against the virus."
1291,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 01:21AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Pentagon to stockpile rare earth magnets for missiles, fighter jets","By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - The U.S. military plans to stockpile rare earth magnets used in Javelin missiles and F-35 fighter jets, according to a government document seen by Reuters, a step that critics say does little to help create a domestic industry to build specialized magnets now made almost exclusively in Asia.
The Pentagon is seeking proposals to cache a rotating six-month supply of neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) magnets, a type of rare earth magnet essential to weapons manufacturing, according to the document, detailing the latest attempt to weaken China's control over the rare earths sector.
Beijing has been using that prowess for leverage in its trade war with Washington.
The request effectively seeks someone to warehouse a six-month supply of the specialized magnets and maintain it for at least 30 months. It does not offer financial support for NdFeB magnet manufacturing, which industry analysts and executives say is a short-sighted misstep by the Pentagon.
""This is definitely a curve ball,"" said Peter Afiuny of Urban Mining Co, a privately held company building a rare earth magnet facility near Austin, Texas. ""We expected the call would be strategically aimed at actually doing something to spur domestic production capacity.""
China and Japan are the world's largest NdFeB magnet producers. None of the specialized magnets are made in the United States, though a U.S. Naval Research Laboratory scientist invented them https://www.nrl.navy.mil/content_images/horizon.pdf in the early 1980s.
Reuters reported last week that the Pentagon is funding construction of rare earths processing facilities. But after rare earths are processed, they must be turned into magnets, otherwise they are of little value to electronics and weapons manufacturers.
The Pentagon did not respond to requests for comment.
President Donald Trump this year ordered the military to update its supply chain for the niche materials, warning that reliance on other nations could hamper U.S. defenses.
Responses to this latest Pentagon request are due by Jan. 22, 2020, according to the document.
The Pentagon plans to spend $10 million on the program, with recipients funding another $10 million in total. Each recipient will receive a maximum of $3 million, according to the document.
It was not immediately clear why the Pentagon only wants an available supply for 30 months nor was it clear the volume or grade of magnet being sought or the timeline of when winners could be picked.
""Our government usually moves slowly unless there's a severe crisis, at which time extraordinary action is needed to mitigate the problem,"" said Steve Constantinides, a U.S.-based rare earths industry consultant.
Because  Hitachi Metals Ltd  (T:5486) controls the processing patent for NdFeB magnets, the request is likely to be a boon for the Japanese company. Urban Mining, the Texas startup, says its NdFeB manufacturing process involves recycling of older magnets.
Hitachi licenses its technology to manufacturers in China and elsewhere, but none in the United States. Chinese producers remain by far the world's cheapest producers of magnets.
Hitachi Metals did not respond to a request for comment.
The Pentagon's request acknowledges that if no domestic rare earth sources are available to build the stockpile, foreign suppliers may be used. But the U.S. Congress this year approved legislation that forbids the Pentagon from using magnets made in China, North Korea or Russia, further complicating the supply chain.
Hitachi Metals itself expanded an NdFeB magnet plant in China Grove, North Carolina, in 2011 before shuttering the NdFeB magnet operations around 2015 due to challenging economics. The equipment is being auctioned off now.
That, critics say, points to the need for direct U.S. government involvement.
""Government support is an insurance policy for domestic manufacturing,"" said Ed Richardson of the U.S. Magnetic Materials Association, an industry trade group.
Richardson estimates the Pentagon would need to spend about $50 million to build a U.S. rare earth magnet facility. ""It's a small amount of money to pay so if we go to war with China, we're not calling them up asking for supply"" of rare earth magnets.

The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months, costing the plane manufacturer more than $9 billion so far.
Turkish Airlines (THY) declined to comment on the news report. The airline has 24 Boeing 737 MAX planes in its fleet. In May, its chairman said the company expected compensation for losses incurred over the grounding of the planes.
The Demiroren news agency said the airline was preparing to open a court case over both the uncertainty and Boeing's failure to make an adequate statement regarding the situation. It did not specify a source for the report.
Boeing said on Monday it would suspend production of the 737 MAX in January, its biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years. Its decision came after the Federal Aviation Administration refused to approve the jet's return to service before 2020.
Boeing's fastest-selling jet has already been grounded worldwide with its safety record scrutinized, while customers have pressed for compensation."
1293,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 12:43AM ET</span>",Eskom's New CEO Engaged in Questionable Stock Sales at Sasol,"(Bloomberg) -- (Bloomberg) -- Andre de Ruyter, the incoming head of South Africa's debt-burdened state power utility, engaged in questionable stock sales while working as a senior executive at Sasol Ltd. in 2013, according to a forensic audit report.
De Ruyter, who was Sasol’s senior group executive for global chemicals and North American operations, together with then-chief financial officer, Christine Ramon, knew about cost overruns at a chemical project and sold the company's stock before that information was disclosed to other executives, says the report, a copy of which was seen by Bloomberg News. The report formed part of a risk and corporate governance assessment commissioned by the petrochemical conglomerate and undertaken by Werksmans Attorneys, a corporate law firm.
Both executives deny wrongdoing, saying they obtained the necessary authorization to sell stock and weren’t aware of the Werksmans report. Sasol confirmed that the sales were authorized. The report said, however, that had the information about the overruns been more widely known, approval would not have been given.
“It would appear that the information Mr. Andre de Ruyter and Ms. Christine Ramon had at their disposal was price-sensitive information when they traded their shares,’’ the report found, citing as evidence email communication between the executives and people working on the project over several months. Most of the emails were between De Ruyter and other employees; Ramon was copied on some of them.
De Ruyter left Sasol in October 2013, before the report was submitted, following a career that spanned more than two decades, to become chief executive officer of Nampak Ltd., a packaging company. He is set to take the helm at Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. by mid-January. Ramon left a month earlier and took up her current role, as CFO of AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., the world’s third-biggest gold producer, in July 2014.
Why Eskom’s Power Crisis Is South Africa’s Top Risk: QuickTake
Eskom supplies about 95% of South Africa’s power and is struggling to turn itself around after years of mismanagement and alleged graft that have driven it to the brink of insolvency and saddled the company with about $31 billion in debt. As the nation’s biggest state-owned enterprise, the utility is key to maintaining financial and economic stability, and its inability to supply consistent power has hindered the economy.
The chairman and acting CEO of Eskom, Jabu Mabuza, said the company wasn’t aware of any investigation of De Ruyter. “We can confirm that rigorous integrity and reference checks were performed independently in line with normal recruitment processes and as required by the shareholder in supporting the board’s recommendations for any appointment to the position -- these came back with satisfactory results,” he said.
“In 2013, a review into the share trading of certain executives was undertaken,’’ Sasol said in response to questions. Ramon and de Ruyter left before the report was completed and their departures were not related to it, nor were they told about it, the company said. Sasol added it didn’t believe it needed to report the trades to regulatory authorities.
Werksmans confirmed it conducted an investigation but declined to comment further, citing attorney-client privilege. Andre Visser, general manager of issuer regulation at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, said companies are obliged to report all share dealings by directors.
The review came at a time of strained relations between Sasol’s then-CEO, David Constable, and other executives, including De Ruyter and Ramon, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation. De Ruyter had been a formal contender for the CEO role and lost out to Constable, a Canadian national and former  Fluor Corp  (NYSE:FLR). executive. Constable, currently a board member at Fluor and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Plc, acknowledged a request for comment but did not respond further.
Share sales
Stock exchange filings show De Ruyter sold three tranches of the company’s shares for a total of 8.9 million rand ($604,000) on May 14, 2013, while Ramon sold a single tranche for 33.7 million rand the same day. In both cases, the sales represented the majority of the Sasol stock they held, according to the Werksmans document. Both executives reported to Constable at the time.
On the day the two executives sold their shares, the company held a meeting at which other executives were told about the escalating costs of expanding a synthetic wax production project, according to the audit report. Internal Sasol correspondence showed De Ruyter and Ramon knew about the issue as early as February 2013, the report said.
“Both parties are by extension responsible for material misrepresentations in the form of omission and were potentially significantly conflicted in their roles of preparing and finally presenting the material information,’’ the report said.
On May 24, Sasol started a so-called closed period, which would have barred executives from trading their stock. On June 7, 2013, Ramon released a financial update revealing that the estimated cost of the wax project in Sasolburg, south of Johannesburg, had surged to 11.9 billion rand, 40% to 45% more than previously budgeted. The following month, the company announced a 1.5 billion rand write-down on the project, which was eventually completed in 2018 at a cost of 13.5 billion rand.
De Ruyter said he was responsible for the day-to-day operations of Sasol’s chemical plants and not the execution of projects, and that many executives, including Constable, would have been aware of the problems at the project.
The manner in which the report was produced “smacks of an intent to get the imprimatur of a law firm to cast unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations,’’ De Ruyter said in response to Bloomberg’s queries. “I do not consider the matter adequately dealt with.’’
He said the fact that the report had come to light six years after he left Sasol seemed to be an attempt to undermine his credibility as incoming CEO at Eskom. De Ruyter's appointment was criticized by some labor unions and opposition parties, which saw it as a blow to racial transformation because they said there were suitable black candidates for the Eskom job. These included Jacob Maroga, Eskom CEO from 2007 to 2009, and Dan Marokane, the utility’s former head of group capital, according to people with knowledge of the situation.
Stock rebound
Despite the losses, Sasol’s per-share earnings rose 11% in the year through June 2013 as output from its synthetic fuels business increased. That meant the trades didn’t work out optimally for the two executives: The stock surged 25% between the date they sold and the end of 2013.
De Ruyter sold 1.49 million rand-worth of Sasol stock in 2011 and 2012, according to stock exchange disclosures. There is no record of Ramon selling stock.
“I strongly deny that I have acted wrongfully or unlawfully in any manner as alleged or otherwise,” Ramon said in a response to Bloomberg. “I strongly deny that I have made any material misrepresentations and that I was conflicted in any manner as alleged. Sasol’s wax production project had no bearing on my decision to sell my securities in Sasol.”
The audit, which covered the period from Feb. 1 to Aug. 31, 2013, and was concluded after the two executives' departure, analyzed emails, regulatory filings and other documents supplied by the company. Its authors said they were given an unrestricted mandate and had unfettered access to information. They didn’t uncover evidence that Sasol board members breached their fiduciary duty during the review period, the report said.
South Africa’s Financial Markets Act of 2012 specifies that anyone who knowingly deals in securities with undisclosed insider information that could affect their value commits an offense. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange’s listing requirement stipulates that directors need written authorization to trade in their company’s stock and may not be given clearance in any period where they have access to price-sensitive information. Sasol also has American depository receipts, subjecting it to U.S. Securities Exchange Commission rules that require it to disclose material information about legal proceedings and other matters to investors.
While the conduct of individual managers posed challenges, Sasol’s systems and controls were found to be impeccable, and its risk management and peer review mechanisms were robust, the report concluded. The company’s public disclosure and reporting processes were also compliant with the rules “to a fault,” it said.

The lender named Ziggy Switkowski and Kerry Schott as panel members while a third panelist would be announced at a later date, it said in a statement.
Switkowski has held senior management positions in various companies including Suncorp Group Ltd (AX:SUN) and Telstra Corp Ltd (AX:TLS), whereas Schott has served as the managing director of  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and executive vice president of Bankers Trust Australia.
Westpac was hit with a lawsuit in November from Australian financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC which accused it of 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws and facilitating payments between known child abusers.
The independent panel members will oversee Westpac's response to AUSTRAC's allegations, which could cost the bank up to A$1 billion ($689.40 million).
Investors questioned Westpac's outgoing chairman Lindsay Maxsted at the bank's annual shareholder meeting in Sydney last week on remuneration arrangements for the independent panel and whether they would be paid out of shareholder funds.
Westpac did not address these shareholder queries in its statement on Friday.
The scandal hit bank has also hired  IBM  Corp's (N:IBM) financial consulting unit, Promontory, to run an external review of its financial crime prevention processes."

(Reuters) - The general counsel of a U.S. labor agency has accused  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) of violating U.S. labor law by allegedly firing an employee in New York in retaliation for complaining about workplace problems and trying to organize with a union.
The office of the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed the complaint on Dec. 12. The union involved, 32BJ, which is trying to organize workers at the Mexican fast-casual restaurant chain, received a copy of the complaint on Thursday.
Because Chipotle's restaurants are all owned by the corporation as a single employer, it is an easier target for union organizers than fast-food giant McDonald's Corp, most of whose locations are owned and operated by franchisees.
Chipotle spokespeople did not provide an immediate response to requests for comment.
The NLRB's general counsel, Peter Robb, alleged in the complaint that a manager at a restaurant in Manhattan in May threatened to fire employees if they engaged in union activities - even implying they might face physical violence - and promised promotions to other workers who provided information about the organizing.
The complaint, which was filed with the NLRB, also alleges similar manager intimidation at another Manhattan store. One employee who complained about scheduling and other problems was fired.
The complaint asks that Chipotle reimburse the fired employee for expenses incurred from work searches and for tax relief from any lump sum back pay awards. The complaint seeks no other remedy.
The NLRB's general counsel operates independently from the Board and is responsible for investigating and prosecuting unfair labor practices. Robb, who has been general counsel since November 2017, was appointed by President Donald Trump.
The parent of 32BJ, the Service Employees International Union, is involved in the Fight for $15 and a Union, which has long sought to organize workers at McDonald's.
That effort suffered a setback of sorts last week when the full NLRB board approved McDonald's Corp's proposed settlement allowing the fast-food company to avoid a ruling on whether it is a ""joint employer"" of franchise workers and could be made to bargain with unions.
While Fight for $15 and a Union said it would appeal, the decision suggests it may be a long road for organizers if they are not able to target the parent corporation and must instead bargain with thousands of individual U.S. owners.

Chipotle must respond to the complaint by Dec. 26 and a hearing is set for March 2 in New York.

The Reserve Bank of India will buy 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) of the 6.45% 2029 debt and sell an equal amount of notes maturing next year in an auction on Monday, it said in a statement.
The move had been suggested by some traders and strategists as a way to pass on more of the central bank’s five rate reductions this year to businesses and individual borrowers. With investment and consumption both weak in India, policy makers are trying to spur credit and lift growth from a six-year low.
“This will address the steepening yield curve to some extent,” said Paresh Nayar, currency and money markets head at FirstRand Ltd. in Mumbai. “We could see the 10-year yield coming down by about 10 basis points.”
READ: Time for Unconventional RBI Measures, Bond Manager Says
The concept is similar to Operation Twist used by the Fed in 2011-2012 in an effort to cheapen long-term borrowing and spur bank lending. The Fed then swapped short-term Treasury securities for longer-term government debt, which reduced the gap between two- and 10-year yields.
In India, the term premia -- difference between the benchmark 10-year yield and the RBI’s policy rate -- stands at 160 basis points, higher than the typical spread of less than 100 basis points.
The high yields in the longer end reflect concerns about the government adding to record borrowing as it gets ready to prime the economy. The slowdown has reinforced doubts about the administration meeting its budget aim of 3.3% of GDP this fiscal year.
“The RBI should increase the intensity of its Operation Twist via more vigorous switches of government bonds focused on securities in the tenure of 7-10 year plus,” said Madhavi Arora, economist at Edelweiss Securities Ltd.
Not all agree the RBI’s move will work. Selling shorter bonds may blow up yields given the concentration of trading positions in that segment, ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. said in a note.
Also, while the RBI may pull down long-term yields, abundant cash in the banking system totaling 2.4 trillion rupees will cap shorter yields."

(Reuters) - United States antitrust and patent officials on Thursday said they no longer deem holders of industry-standard patents anti-competitive if they sue to stop the sale of infringing products, a far-reaching policy shift that they said supports innovation.
The new position could have seen chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, for instance, sue in an attempt to stop the sale of all models of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's iPhones in Germany last year - rather than the limited number that were ultimately affected - without fear of being investigated by the U.S. antitrust body.
The U.S. Justice Department, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and National Institute of Standards and Technology jointly released a policy statement on so-called standard essential patents to replace its policy since 2013.
Standard essential patents are often used in the technology industry when makers of different kinds of devices want them all to work together. In the case of cellular networks, for example, phones and cell towers must be compatible across makers and borders.
To arrive at a single standard, companies such as Nokia (HE:NOKIA), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and InterDigital Wireless contribute patents to a certain technology such as 5G, the upcoming generation of cellular data networks. 
Every company that makes a cellular device is required to adopt that technology and pay a license fee to patent holders. In exchange, the holders agree to license the patents on fair and reasonable terms.
In 2013, the Justice Department and Patent Office said it was anti-competitive for patent holders to seek injunctions to block the sale of a products for infringing standards patents. Holders could still seek monetary damages without running afoul of the policy.
The policy had real-world effects. When Qualcomm sued Apple to block the sale of iPhones during a wide-ranging legal dispute, Qualcomm did not use any of its standards patents to make its claims. As a result, Qualcomm's suits affected only a subset of models.
Officials reversed their policy on Thursday, saying seeking to block sales in standards patents cases presented no harm to competition and that standards patents should be treated no differently than other patents.
""Our patent system is what has made the American economy the innovation capital of the world, and we should not misapply the antitrust laws to diminish the incentive to innovate,"" Assistant Attorney General Delrahim said in a statement.
Morgan Reed, president of The App Association, in a statement said the group which represents software developers was disappointed by the move.
It ""does not go far enough in protecting small businesses from abusive (standards patent) licensing behavior,"" Reed said.

The strategic investment is Ant’s eighth international deal. Ant will not control more than 50% of eMonkey, but will hold a sizable stake and offer technical support to the e-wallet provider.
Established by the Vietnamese fintech company M-Pay Trade, eMonkey is said to have obtained its operating license from the State Bank of Vietnam. M-Pay also partners with most of Vietnam’s largest banks and telecom companies.
Vietnam recorded the highest e-commerce growth in the region, mainly due to the fact that a quarter of its 100 million people are under 25.
Reuters reported that the deal moved ahead quietly to avoid pushback amid anti-China sentiment in the Southeast Asian country. Disputes over maritime claims and China-backed special economic zones have remained unresolved between China and Vietnam.
“It makes sense that Chinese investors — including those who see the Vietnamese market as having a ton of consumer potential, as well as those diversifying into that country as part of the trade war — may want to keep a low profile,” Nick Marro, global trade lead at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told Reuters."

ACCC said the German automaker admitted that it switched to two different software modes for testing and driving conditions, thereby not disclosing the original level of nitrogen oxide emissions.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 08:11PM ET</span>",French court to rule on culpability of ex-Orange bosses in workers' suicides,"PARIS (Reuters) - Judges will rule on Friday whether former bosses at telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN) were responsible for a spate of suicides at the company in the late 2000s, a traumatic episode that prompted soul-searching over corporate culture in France.
Ex-CEO Didier Lombard, along with three former executives and the company itself, is accused of ""moral harassment"", in the first case of its kind on this scale in France.
Prosecutors argued that some of the methods employed in a deep restructuring of the company, then known as  France Telecom , after privatisation triggered a wave of suicides.
Orange said through a spokesman it acknowledges the suffering expressed by victims and recognises there may have been management errors in implementing the restructuring plan but denies there was any systemic plan or intention to harass employees.
Prosecutors have called for Lombard to be sentenced to a year in jail and fined 15,000 euros ($16,700). Lombard, 77, denies wrongdoing.
The other former executives have also denied responsibility and have said the restructuring plan was an economic necessity.
The former telecoms monopoly used the last day of the trial in July to offer compensation to victims and relatives of those who died. The presiding judge estimated that claims for compensation so far amounted to about 2 million euros ($2.25 million).
A guilty verdict from the court in Paris against Lombard and the company would set a precedent for big business and could pave the way for other similar collective procedures in France.
The case centres around a drive by the former state monopoly to shed 22,000 jobs and redeploy another 10,000 as it adapted to competition in the private sector.
In a country where workers employed on state contracts expect jobs for life and employees in both private and public sectors enjoy strong labour law protection, unions alleged that management sought ways to encourage workers to quit or accept reassignment.
A 2010 report by labour inspectors said management used ""pathogenic"" restructuring methods such as forcing people into new jobs in far away cities and giving them unattainable performance objectives.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Chinese automakers Great Wall Motor (SS:601633) and Changan Automobile (SZ:000625) are accelerating plans to build cars in India after the initial success of rival SAIC Motor (SS:600104) in one of the world's biggest markets, three sources said.
Great Wall, one of the biggest sellers of sports-utility vehicles (SUV) in China, expects to secure a production site in the first half of 2020, likely a General Motors (N:GM) plant in Maharashtra, a source familiar with Great Wall's plans said.
Buying a factory is seen as the best way to get up and running fast and Great Wall is finalizing which SUVs it plans to make in India, including whether to kick off its launch with an electric SUV, the source told Reuters.
Great Wall said it would make an announcement next month about its plans for India but declined further comment.
A spokesman for GM in Detroit said it was continuing to make vehicles for export at its Talegaon plant in Maharashtra state.
""As we have said previously, we continue to explore options to improve utilization of the plant. We do not comment on speculation,"" he said.
Changan, too, is scouting for a production base and has held initial talks with suppliers, sources aware of its plans said. Both automakers, which produce electric vehicles (EVs) in China, are also considering whether to set up EV battery assembly plants in India, the sources said.
Changan declined to comment.
The companies see India as a chance to combat slowing sales at home, which fell in November for a 17th month in a row. While car sales in India are stuttering, the market is expected to become the world's third biggest by 2026, behind China and the United States, according to consultancy LMC Automotive
The Chinese firms also hope to capitalize on gaps left by global automakers such as  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), Ford Motor (N:F) and GM which have scaled back plans in a market still dominated by smaller, low-cost cars made by Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI) and  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380).
""It is an opportune time for China's automakers to enter India. There is currently a gap in competition and it may take a couple of years for some of the established carmakers to bring new products to the market,"" said LMC Automotive's Ammar Master.
PERCEPTION GAP
GM's retreat from India, for example, could help Great Wall get going quickly and it has been in talks to buy GM's plant in Maharashtra, two of the sources said.
GM stopped selling cars in India in 2017 and has already sold its other plant in Gujarat to SAIC, where the state-owned Chinese automaker now makes the Hector SUV it launched in June under its MG Motor brand.
India is part of Great Wall's planned global expansion into South America, South Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia, and it also plans to export from their to places such as Europe and the United States, said the source who is aware of its plans.
""The plant in India is expected to be the biggest for Great Wall outside of China,"" the source said.
Great Wall has hired a former executive from Maruti Suzuki, India's biggest carmaker, for its product and business planning, and appointed a former executive from SAIC's India division as a consultant to liaise with the government.
""For global automakers, India is one of the many markets they are in but for the Chinese it is the first major market outside of home and so the level of investment and commitment will be proportionately high,"" said the source.
One of the biggest hurdles in India will be fighting perceptions about the quality and reliability of Chinese products and winning over brand-conscious buyers for whom cars are a prestige statement, say analysts.
Chinese smartphone makers such as  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) faced similar perception issues when they launched in India but they now dominate the market. However, cars remain a significant outlay for most Indians and the Chinese brands will need to make their mark quickly.
""Once the likes of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford start launching new models in India, the entrants from China could face tougher competition because a lot of buyers in India are still very brand conscious,"" said LMC's Master.
SAIC LESSONS
Still, the initial success of SAIC's Hector SUV has helped. Launched at the end of June it said it had sold more than 13,000 cars by the end of November and plans to sell 24,000 next year.
""SAIC has changed the perception about whether a Chinese brand can be made and sold in India,"" said Santosh Pai, partner at law firm Link Legal which advises Chinese companies setting up in India. ""Fence sitters are getting in and have realized they can sell in India if the price and strategy is right.""
Lessons for Great Wall and Changan from SAIC's India launch include marketing the brand aggressively, packing the car with features to differentiate it from rivals and giving extended warranties to dispel doubts over reliability, analysts say.
Another advantage for Chinese carmakers in the coming years will be their EV expertise. With the sale of EVs slowing in China they can deploy some of their existing capacity to India where the government is encouraging clean fuel cars.
SAIC, which will soon launch an electric SUV in India, is also scouting for a second manufacturing site and is expected to make a decision in early 2020, said a source aware of its plans.
SAIC did not respond to a request for comment though the head of its Indian division said in November it was working on an expansion plan and expected its total sales in India to hit 70,000 in 2021.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 07:26PM ET</span>",UK car industry calls for tariff-free deal with EU as output slumps,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's car industry body called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to secure a tariff-free trade deal with the European Union which avoids barriers for businesses as production slumped in November.
Output fell 16.5 percent last month to 107,753 cars, continuing a trend of decline in 2019 which leaves output down 14.5% in the first 11 months of the year to 1.2 million vehicles, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
Johnson convincingly won an election last week which puts Britain on track to leave the EU by the end of next month, guaranteeing a transition period until the end of 2020 during which time little will change in its relationship with the bloc.
Much of next year will be dominated by talks between London and Brussels on the future partnership to take effect from 2021, with manufacturers seeking the closest possible relationship to maintain their seamless production processes.
""UK car production is export-led, so we look forward to working with the new government to deliver an ambitious trade deal with the EU,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.
""That deal needs to be tariff-free and avoid barriers to trade, which, for automotive, means that our standards must be aligned."""
1304,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: ChemChina seeks funding from Chinese state-backed firms ahead of Syngenta IPO - sources,"By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China National Chemical Corp, or ChemChina, has approached Chinese state-backed investors for up to $10 billion in funding as part of a reorganisation of its agrichemicals business ahead of a public float, according to five people familiar with the situation. The reorganisation includes Swiss giant Syngenta.
The fundraising efforts and eventual stock market listing are designed to cut ChemChina's debts ahead of a long-awaited mega-merger with state-owned peer Sinochem. Frank Ning, the chairman of both companies, has encouraged individual business units to tap capital markets ahead of any tieup, which has been in the works since 2016. 
Executives from ChemChina and Sinochem have been involved in the approaches to potential investors, according to two of the sources, who have direct knowledge of the talks. They turned to fellow state-owned firms after some international investors shunned the offer as too expensive, the five people said.
Liang Xiaoliang, a corporate communication executive at ChemChina, described the Reuters' reporting as 'false information'. He Yujie, the general manager of Sinochem's legal department, said there was no factual basis to the reporting. Both companies declined to provide further details. 
ChemChina wants to list Syngenta, the Swiss pesticide producer it bought for $45 billion in 2016, on China's technology-focused STAR market in mid-2020, according to fundraising documents dated from October.
The documents, sent to prospective investors, still represent the companies' current plans, according to two of the sources. 
A possible listing on STAR, where company valuations are generally higher than on the main Shanghai Stock Exchange, has not previously been reported. Such a listing, if it met regulatory approvals, would be the chemical industry's biggest-ever IPO. 
In order to secure a listing on STAR, ChemChina and Sinochem have created a holding company called SAS Holding (SAS) which will house assets including Syngenta, as well as majority stakes in Shenzhen-listed crop protection company Adama and Sinochem's fertilizer unit, known as Sinofert, according to the fundraising documents. The creation of SAS has not been previously reported.
Syngenta, Adama and Sinofert did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. 
SAS would enable Syngenta to trade on STAR because as a Shanghai-based holding company, it would be considered a domestic entity, one of the requirements for listing on the exchange. On its own, Syngenta would be considered a foreign company and ineligible, according to one of the people.
A WARMER RECEPTION 
In return for $10 billion, ChemChina and Sinochem are looking to sell about 20%-30% of SAS by year-end and use the proceeds to repay debt ChemChina took on to fund the Syngenta deal, according to the fundraising documents. That range indicates SAS would be valued at upto $50 billion after the fundraising is complete.
Some international investors, however, balked at the offer, according to the five sources.
The problem centered on the implied valuation for Syngenta, likely to comprise the biggest component of SAS, according to the fundraising documents.
ChemChina leveraged up to buy the Swiss giant, creating a global player in agrichemicals and driving the Chinese company's debt levels to around 10 times EBITDA at the end of 2018, according to figures from Moody's rating agency.
The acquisition, China's largest overseas deal, was described as a mistake by China's ambassador to Switzerland in a Swiss newspaper interview published in June.
To entice funding, ChemChina and Sinochem have cut the asking price, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions and have turned to state-backed investors including banks, insurers and other financial groups in the hope of a warmer reception.
ChemChina and Sinochem are now offering these state-backed investors shares that would value SAS at about $30 billion, according to one of the people with direct knowledge of the talks. That price tag would imply a large drop in the estimated valuation of Syngenta.
Reuters could not determine what the implied valuation of Syngenta would be in the event SAS was valued at $30 billion as it is not clear exactly what proportion of SAS it would represent.
""State investors are generally under pressure from the government or banks to support firms seen as national champions. China has supported the Syngenta acquisition and would not like to see the IPO fail,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research.
The state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), the primary regulator of Chinese state-owned companies, did not respond to a request for comment. 
In addition to seeking fresh funding, ChemChina has also asked some of its creditors from the Syngenta deal, including Bank of China and state-owned investor China Reform Holdings, to swap some of their debt in ChemChina for equity in SAS, three sources said.
ChemChina initially took on nearly $33 billion in loans to complete the Syngenta acquisition.
Bank of China and China Reform Holdings did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. 

ChemChina and Sinochem will miss their self-imposed year-end deadline to close the fundraising, said the two people with direct knowledge of the matter, and are now aiming to complete it in the first half of 2020.

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Property firm UDR explores deal with Mack-Cali Realty - sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - U.S. multi-family apartment firm UDR Inc (N:UDR) is exploring a combination with  Mack-Cali Realty Corp  (N:CLI), an owner of multi-family rental properties and commercial office space, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
UDR's interest coincides with a board committee established by Mack-Cali to review its strategic options mulling whether to pursue a sale of the company. Mack-Cali said on Thursday that it would follow the committee's recommendation to sell its suburban office portfolio totaling approximately 6.6 million square feet.
UDR is in talks about partnering on its bid for Mack-Cali with investment firm Rizk Ventures CEO Thomas Rizk, and has contacted Mack-Cali to express its interest, the sources said. Rizk was CEO of Mack-Cali from 1997 to 1999, and previously led Cali Realty, whose merger with Mack Company created Mack-Cali in 1997. 
UDR and Rizk are discussing whether to make an offer for the entirety of Mack-Cali, using debt financing to help fund the deal, two of the sources said. Mack-Cali has a market capitalization of $1.8 billion, and total debt as of the end of September of $3.2 billion.
UDR is interested in the company's residential properties, while Rizk is eying some of its commercial offices space, according to the sources.
The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. UDR and Mack-Cali did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Rizk Ventures declined to comment.
Mack-Cali shares rose 3.8% to $21.68, while UDR shares spiked 3.3% to $47.69 on the news in afterhours trading in New York on Thursday. 
Mack-Cali has a property portfolio across six states in the northeastern United States, but has been shedding many suburban properties to focus on Jersey City's waterfront area overlooking New York City, where it owns luxury apartments and offices. It is betting this prime location will shield it from the high vacancy and low rents seen in suburban markets. 
Mack-Cali said on Thursday it had approved the sale of two suburban office portfolios, encompassing 2.4 million square feet in Parsippany, New Jersey and Madison, New Jersey, to Onyx Equities LLC and other investment firms for about $285 million in cash and $3.5 million of assumed lease obligations.  
In March, Mack-Cali turned down an offer of between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion for its suburban and waterfront office assets, hotel joint venture interests and retail assets from invest firms Bow Street and David Werner Real Estate Investments. It argued such a deal would shortchange Mack-Cali shareholders at a time when its turnaround strategy had not been fully implemented.
Bow Street subsequently succeeded in installing four independent directors to Mack-Cali's board, expanding it to 11 members.
UDR owned 52,070 apartment homes as of the end of September, including 658 homes under development. It has a market capitalization of about $14 billion.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 06:57PM ET</span>","Nike quarterly results beat, but North America disappoints","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -  Nike  Inc's (N:NKE) quarterly revenue and profit blew past Wall Street expectations on Thursday on strong sales in China, but lower-than-expected growth in North America, its biggest market, overshadowed the beat.
The world's largest footwear maker faces intense competition from brands like Adidas (DE:ADSGn), Skechers (N:SKX) and VF Corp's (N:VFC) Vans in North America, even as it pushes to sell exclusive merchandise through its tap-and-buy SNKRS app and retail stores.
In its attempt to gain market share over rivals, Nike has collaborated with celebrities, ramped up sneaker launches and increased marketing around major sporting events.
In November, the company ended a two-year-old partnership with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) to sell Nike's merchandise directly on the online retailer's website, to focus more on sneaker launches on its own digital platforms.
Nike's revenue from North America rose 5.3% to $3.98 billion in the second quarter, compared with the previous year's 9% rise, but missed Wall Street expectations of $4 billion.
""The comparisons are getting tougher in North America. It's partially that - this recovery for the Nike brand started last year and it really accelerated (that time),"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Cristina Fernandez said.
The company's gross margin of 44% was also slightly below estimates of 44.1%, hurt by higher product costs due to incremental tariffs in North America.
Nike's shares, which hit a record high in regular trading on Thursday, were down about 2% after the closing bell. They have risen 36.4% this year, outpacing the 22% gain in the blue-chip Dow Jones index (DJI).
In Greater China, the fastest-growing market for Nike, revenue rose 20% to $1.85 billion. The company recently introduced its app in the country, which outgoing Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker said on Thursday was downloaded 1 million times.
Parker will be stepping down in the new year, handing over control to John Donahoe, the former CEO of online marketplace eBay (O:EBAY) and cloud computing company ServiceNow (N:NOW).
Nike's net income jumped 31.6% to $1.12 billion, or 70 cents per share, in the quarter ended Nov. 30, while analysts on average had expected 58 cents per share.

Overall revenue rose 10.2% to $10.33 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $10.09 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The catalysts included Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's comment that the phase one U.S.-China trade agreement should be signed in January. There have been some worries that the continued lack of specific details signals larger issues.
Chip stocks enjoyed healthy gains, partly driven by a rally in Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS), reportedly the possible target of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index jumped 0.8% and hit new closing and intraday highs.
Also rising were chip stars such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU).

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 05:22PM ET</span>",Bailey to replace Carney as Bank of England boss: source,"LONDON (Reuters) - Former Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey, one of the City of London's most experienced financial regulators, is set to be named as the new governor of the British central bank, a person familiar with the process said.
Bailey, 60, worked for 30 years at the BoE before moving in 2016 to his current job as chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority which is charged with cracking down on misconduct in the finance industry. 
The Financial Times, which reported earlier on Thursday that Bailey would get the top job at the BoE, said finance minister Sajid Javid was expected to announce the choice of who will replace Mark Carney as the BoE's new governor on Friday.
A spokesman for Britain's finance ministry declined to comment.
Britain has delayed the appointment of a new BoE governor since last year with the country focused on Brexit - the impact of which remains a big challenge for the central bank - and on an election won by Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week.
Carney, a Canadian, is due to stand down on Jan. 31.
Other names lined with the jobs have included BoE deputy governor, Minouche Shafik, Shriti Vadera, chair of Santander (MC:SAN) UK, and former Federal Reserve policymaker Kevin Warsh.
Gerard Lyons, who was economic adviser to Johnson while London mayor, was considered to have fallen short of the requirements of the job but still had an outside chance of getting it, the FT said earlier on Thursday.
Lyons is well known for his pro-Brexit views which are unusual among professional economists.
Johnson rejected Shafik because of her critical views on Brexit, the FT said.
Bailey was deeply involved in shoring up the British banking system during the global financial crisis while at the BoE, and he remains a familiar face to the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world.
Other roles included helping the BoE to contain the fallout from the collapse of Barings in the late 1980s and participating in the introduction of a new currency in war-torn Iraq in 2003. He has also served as the BoE's chief cashier. 
In his current job at the FCA, Bailey has been criticized for not publishing in full a report into alleged misconduct by bank RBS (LON:RBS). Bailey cited privacy restrictions.
His chances of getting the BoE job were seen to have been further dented after the demise of the Woodford equity fund which was popular with retail investors. Bailey has said the FCA was limited in what it could do by European Union rules.

The FT said current BoE deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Jon Cunliffe were still hopeful they might get the top job.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday rejected Southwest Airlines Co's (N:LUV) bid to dismiss a discrimination lawsuit by an American of Iraqi descent who was removed from a 2016 flight after another passenger heard him speak in Arabic and feared he might be a terrorist.
U.S. District Judge Donna Ryu in Oakland, California said Khairuldeen Makhzoomi could try to show that ""Islamophobia,"" coming amid a ""sensitive political climate,"" was a factor behind his removal, and that Southwest's claim he was removed because he appeared to make threats was pretextual.
Ryu said Makhzoomi could seek damages from Southwest for alleged violations of federal and California civil rights laws, but dismissed claims of negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
The Dallas-based carrier had argued there was ""at most a scintilla of evidence"" suggesting racial animus, and said its employees acted reasonably in considering Makhzoomi a possible safety threat.
Southwest did not immediately respond to requests for comment. One of its lawyers declined to comment.
""The case is moving forward, and we look forward to trial,"" said Zahra Billoo, a lawyer for Makhzoomi. A trial is scheduled for Feb. 3, 2020.
The incident occurred on an April 6, 2016 Southwest flight awaiting takeoff to Oakland from Los Angeles.
Makhzoomi, then a 26-year-old public policy student at the University of California, Berkeley, had been talking with his uncle by cellphone after attending a dinner featuring United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.
Two police officers and Southwest customer service manager Shoaib Ahmed removed Makhzoomi from the plane after a woman who had been seated nearby became agitated, and reported having heard him use words associated with suicide martyrdom.
""I would say the fact that 'American' was said next to it, and I'm on a plane, I wasn't sure what to make of it,"" the woman, her name shielded by a pseudonym, said in a deposition.
Makhzoomi, a U.S. citizen who arrived in the country as an Iraqi refugee, denied making threatening statements, and denied Ahmed's claim that he had used the words bomb, ISIS, jihad and martyrdom on the plane.
Southwest's lawyers also represent Ahmed.
Makhzoomi was questioned by local law enforcement and the FBI before flying home on Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), after Southwest decided not to rebook him and instead refunded his ticket, court papers show.
The case is Makhzoomi v Southwest Airlines Co et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-00924."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes resumed their rally with fresh records on Thursday as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said an initial U.S.-China trade deal would be signed in early January.
The benchmark S&P 500 hit a sixth straight all-time high, its longest streak since January 2018, and the Nasdaq ended with gains for the seventh session in a row. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all notched record closing highs.
Mnuchin's comments bolstered the optimism that has carried U.S. stocks higher since a trade agreement was announced last week. In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Mnuchin said the agreement had already been put down on paper and translated, and it would not be subject to renegotiation.
The comments relieved some concerns that disagreements between Washington and Beijing could once again keep the trade deal from being finalized, market analysts said.
""There's still trepidation until we get to the actual signing,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. ""That said, because we've gotten some positive comments from both Beijing and Washington, it seems we're likely close to getting a signing of the trade détente.""
Further boosting optimism around the strength of the U.S. economy and labor market, data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropping from more than a two-year high last week. 
The market shrugged off U.S. President Donald Trump's impeachment, as the Republican-controlled Senate is widely expected not to remove him from office.

Conagra Brands Inc (N:CAG) shares jumped 15.9% after the Slim Jim maker beat quarterly sales and profit estimates.
Conagra's results also lifted other packaged food makers and helped the S&P 500 consumer staples index (SPLRCS) advance 0.6%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo's board of directors will be called to testify before Congress about the bank's numerous scandals sometime in 2020, a senior U.S. House lawmaker told Reuters Thursday.
Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said in a brief interview she wanted to press the board on their role in righting the bank after years of fines, regulatory penalties, and business upheaval.
""We're going to get some of their board members up here, and see what kind of responsibilities their board members are taking for the management of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),"" she said. ""We're going to have hearings, absolutely.""
Waters, a Democrat from California, added that she remains convinced that Wells is too big to be properly managed and should be broken up.
""We're going to focus especially on Wells Fargo,"" she said of her panel's agenda next year. ""There's a new CEO there, but I think the culture of Wells Fargo has developed in such a way that it's going to be very difficult for this new CEO to get his arms around it.""
The San Francisco-based bank is on its third chief executive since disclosing a wide-ranging sales practice scandal in 2016. Charles Scharf, the former CEO of Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), took the lead role at the bank in October.
Scharf sits on the bank's board, which is currently chaired by Elizabeth Duke, who once served on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.
The bank declined to comment.
The San Francisco-based bank is currently operating under more than a dozen regulatory consent orders, including an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet from the Fed until the bank proves it has fixed its risk controls. Additionally, Wells Fargo faces federal probes by the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commision and the Department of Labor.
As part of its latest overhaul, the bank also hired a new head of public affairs, William Daley, who worked with Scharf at BNY Mellon and previously served as chief of staff to President Barack Obama.

Separately in 2020, Waters also said she plans to pursue legislation that would set a national interest rate cap of 36% on consumer loans, continue to scrutinize Facebook's attempts to establish a new digital currency, Libra, and redouble efforts to address homelessness in America.

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) is in talks with the U.S. government and a state regulator to possibly pay up to $2 billion and admit guilt to resolve investigations into its role in the 1MDB Malaysian corruption scandal, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The bank and U.S. officials have discussed a deal in which a Goldman subsidiary in Asia would plead guilty to violating U.S. bribery laws, the Wall Street Journal first reported https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-in-talks-to-admit-guilt-pay-2-billion-fine-to-settle-1mdb-probe-11576760406?mod=rsswn&page=1&pos=2 on Thursday.
The discussions could also involve Goldman installing an independent monitor to oversee and recommend changes to its compliance procedures. Involved in the discussions are three federal regulators - the U.S. Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve - and New York's Department of Financial Services, according to the source.
In a statement, the bank said that settlement talks are ongoing and it continues to cooperate with regulators.
The SEC and the Justice Department declined to comment. Representatives for the other regulators did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A settlement could be announced in late January, sources familiar with negotiations said.
The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up the 1MDB fund in 2009, and the U.S. Justice Department estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014.
Goldman has been investigated by regulators in at least 14 countries, including the United States, Malaysia, Singapore and others, for its underwriting role and what it did and did not know at the time of the transactions.
In November 2018, the U.S. Justice Department filed criminal charges against two former Goldman Sachs bankers tied to the scandal, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng. 
According to the U.S. Justice Department, Goldman earned $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.
The bank has consistently tried to distance itself from the scandal, saying Leissner and Ng worked to conceal their criminal activities from bank management. 
Leissner pleaded guilty to the charges last year. Ng pleaded not guilty to charges in May, and his case is currently pending in federal court in Brooklyn. 

Spokespeople for Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the attorney general of Malaysia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) agreed on Thursday to pay restitution and accept greater oversight to settle a multi-year probe finding that it had illegally required New York City employees to find substitutes when they needed to use sick leave.
The settlement with Starbucks, which has changed its sick leave policy, was announced by New York Attorney General Letitia James, New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio and the city's consumer affairs commissioner, Lorelei Salas.
It requires the Seattle-based coffee chain to pay $176,000 in restitution to employees, a sum that could grow if exhausted, and prominently post educational posters about the city's sick leave law in all city stores.
Starbucks must also clearly explain its sick leave policy in to its more than 8,000 New York City employees, and detail its compliance within six months to regulators.
The settlement runs three years and could be extended if Starbucks violates it.
Starbucks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Officials said Starbucks violated New York City's Earned Safe and Sick Time Act from April 2014 to February 2016 by requiring employees to find replacements before using sick leave, or else face possible discipline including termination.
In January 2018, Starbucks adopted a nationwide policy granting employees one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked. That equates to roughly seven or eight days a year for a full-time employee.

""I am confident in the steps that Starbucks has taken to correct their actions,"" James said in a statement.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's highest court on Thursday upheld a 186 million Swiss franc ($190.34 million) penalty against Switzerland's largest telecoms provider  Swisscom  (S:SCMN), saying pricing policies in its internet business violated cartel laws.
Switzerland's Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed Swisscom's appeal against a fine imposed for earlier anti-competitive behavior in its broadband internet business, saying the company's pricing policies between 2001 and 2007 had hindered competitors.
""Swisscom regrets the Federal Supreme Court's decision and believes that the sanction is unjustified,"" Switzerland's largest telecoms firm said in a statement.
The fine was paid already in 2016 and would have no impact on its 2019 financial statements, it said.
""The guidance for the current financial year remains unchanged,"" it said.
Switzerland's competition committee had sanctioned Swisscom for the activity in 2009, saying the company had abused its market-dominant position in the broadband business to make it impossible for competitors to operator profitably. A court in 2015 reduced the fine."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Thursday it is issuing recalls for more than 900,000 vehicles worldwide in two separate campaigns to address brake software issues and fire risks.
The largest U.S. automaker is recalling more than 550,000 2019 light-duty Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Cadillac CT6 and GMC Sierra 1500 vehicles due to a potential software glitch that could disable vehicle brake systems and notifications. 
The error, which GM said was rare, may result in the vehicle's electronic stability control or anti-lock brake system becoming disabled. GM said the vehicle's diagnostic system will not illuminate the instrument cluster alert. Dealers will reflash the software to address the issue.
GM is also recalling more than 400,000 2019-2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 trucks because battery positive cable rings may have been manufactured with excessive glue, potentially resulting in a fire risk or stalling.
GM dealers will inspect vehicles for glue or other contamination and replace damaged components if necessary.
One fire has been reported and no injuries linked to the campaign. Some vehicles are covered by both recalls. The recall was prompted by a report of a stall by a GM employee in Canada.

The recalls include 814,000 vehicles in the United States.

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 11:04AM ET</span>",Trump called Boeing CEO to inquire about 737 MAX production halt: sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called Boeing (N:BA) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg this week to ask about the status of 737 MAX production, two people briefed on the matter confirmed.
The call on Sunday was brief and Muilenburg assured Trump that the planned production halt was temporary and that the company would not be laying off any workers. The production halt, set to begin in January, was announced by Boeing Monday after a board meeting.
Boeing and the White House declined to comment on the call, reported earlier by the New York Times.
Separately, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings on Thursday downgraded Boeing's credit rating to ""A-"" from ""A"" and lowered the short-term rating to ""A-2"" from ""A-1."" 
The change ""reflects the uncertainty over when the 737 MAX will return to service, the risk to the supply chain from the planned production halt, and possible long-term impact to Boeing's competitive position.""
U.S. officials have repeatedly said they are waiting for additional answers from Boeing and have at time faulted the quality of submissions from the planemaker since the plane was grounded in March after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. 
“We’ve had conversations about the importance of making sure that we are looking at complete documentation and not piecemeal documentation,” FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Reuters in September. ""It’s really better to be very methodical and very detailed rather than try to rush a partially completed product and then say, ‘We’ll get back to you with the rest of it.’""
Boeing has repeatedly said it is working with regulators to safely return the plane to service and acknowledged last week it would not occur until 2020.
Dickson said last week there are nearly a dozen milestones that must be completed before the MAX returns to service. Approval is not likely until at least February and could be delayed until March, U.S. officials told Reuters last week.

Innio, formerly known as Jenbacher and owned by buyout group Advent, as well as the two other bidders last week made bids for the VW unit, which could have a valuation of 1.5-2 billion euros ($1.7-$2.2 billion) in a potential sale, they said.
Other bidders such as Hyundai Heavy (KS:267250) are no longer in the running, they added.
The divestment is part of Volkswagen's efforts to slim down and simplify the group which has 12 brands, trucks, buses, motorbikes, cars and electric bicycles as part of its business.
While the car maker is not running a formal auction process it is expected that the bidders may be asked to submit final offers at the end of February, the sources said.
Volkswagen, which has offered to retain a significant minority in the business, declined to comment. The bidders declined to comment or had no immediate comment.
The business, formerly known as MAN Diesel & Turbo, also makes turbochargers used in the oil & gas industry and in 2018 reported operating earnings of 133 million euros on sales of 3.1 billion euros.
This year, MAN Energy Solutions is expected to post roughly 200 million euros in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, one of the people said.
Cummins trades at 7.7 times its expected core earnings, while  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) trades at 9.3 times and Wartsila (HE:WRT1V) trades at 9.8 times.
""MAN Energy Solution's value has been in decline following years of years of underinvestment,"" one of the sources said, adding the industry's margins have come under pressure as demand from power plants has waned with the switch to more renewable energy sources.
Peers often specialize in just part of the unit's product range which includes 2-stroke engines, 4-stroke engines and turbochargers, limiting interest, the sources added.
Volkswagen has struggled to slim down in the past after the company's works council, which has veto powers over major restructuring, blocked efforts to sell motorbike brand Ducati.
MAN Energy Solutions was originally a part of VW's trucks brand MAN, but some of MAN's assets were transferred to Volkswagen last year as part of efforts to streamline Traton ahead of the unit's listing.

Adidas described the collection, which features on the cover of January's Elle magazine, as gender neutral. It includes jumpsuits, cargo pants, hoodies and cycling shorts, mostly featuring signature Adidas triple-stripes.
The German sportswear brand announced it was teaming up with the singer in April to relaunch the Ivy Park brand Beyonce started in 2016 together with British fashion chain Topshop. The company did not give financial details.
The partnership comes as Adidas seeks to attract more female customers, an area where it has lagged bigger rival  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and German competitor Puma, which saw its sales boosted by a collaboration with singer Rihanna that ended last year.
Adidas does not expect much of an immediate help to sales from the initial Beyonce collection, but it will ramp up over time, Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told analysts in November.
""You're going to see several launches coming up, but they have no substantial revenue impact and this has been part of the plan all the time. You will see that change throughout next year,"" the CEO said.
Adidas has eroded Nike's dominance of the U.S. market in recent years, helped by partnerships with celebrities like Kanye West and Pharrell Williams (NYSE:WMB), but Nike has been growing faster in China and Europe, a trend that continued in the latest results.

Ivy Park said last year Beyonce had bought the fitness clothing brand from Topshop.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Vladimir Putin said he saw no point in providing Belarus with a gas discount until a project to create deeper ties between the two states advanced, ratcheting up pressure on his Belarusian counterpart who has complained of bullying from Moscow.
Putin is due to meet Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in St Petersburg on Friday.
Russia has helped prop Lukashenko over the past 25 years with loans and energy subsidies, but Moscow started to scale back this help last year, prompting Lukashenko to accuse Russia of trying to bully his much smaller country into a union.
Russia and Belarus have been discussing deeper integration, or a 'union state', for around two decades, but have failed to agree on key points, including a united currency.
The leaders discussed 'prospects for deepening integration as part of a union state' in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Dec 7.
Putin, speaking at his annual news conference on Thursday, said that little had been done so far.
""Decisions which were made at the time related to a build up of the union state. At best, the key decisions were not implemented. Simply speaking, 90% has not been done,"" he said.
Belarus has long complained about the gas price it gets from Russia, saying Minsk should be paying the same as the neighboring Russian region of Smolensk given that the countries are trying to set up a union state.
The Belarusian government also says it stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars a year from changes to Russian tax policy and wants compensation. Russia says the subsidies it pays to Belarus cost its exchequer billions of dollars.
On Thursday, Putin said that Belarus was paying $127 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas, the lowest among those countries to which Moscow exports and much lower than the around $200 per 1,000 cubic meter average price for Europe.
""It would be a mistake to start subsidizing Belarus (more) given the unresolved issue of the union state's build up,"" Putin said.
Putin's current term ends in 2024 when the constitution requires him to leave the Kremlin. However, some critics have speculated he could try to bypass the constitutional limit on serving more than two consecutive terms and retain power by becoming head of a unified Russian and Belarusian state.
The Kremlin denies this."

Reuters reported on Sunday that Daimler's main Chinese joint venture partner BAIC planned to double its stake to around 10% in order to upstage rival Chinese automaker Geely, which owns 9.69% of the German company.
The ministry said that while the companies' combined 20% holding would not amount to a blocking minority, it could have a major impact at shareholder meetings, depending on how others voted.
""So the Economy Ministry is naturally monitoring the situation closely,"" the official said.
The comments come amid heightened concern in Germany at the economic and security implications of increasingly fierce competition from Chinese manufacturers, especially in areas of traditional German strength such as the automotive sector.
Berlin is also facing pressure from the United States to exclude Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei from tenders for building next-generation mobile networks.

Accenture (NYSE:ACN) stock fell 0.7% after giving revenue guidance for the current quarter below consensus forecasts.
In the three months through November, the consulting firm beat estimates for both revenue and earnings as investments in fast-growing digital and cloud support services paid off. Gross margins rose 100 basis points on the year to 32.1%.

Earnings per share of $2.09 were 4.5% above consensus forecasts. Revenue of $11.36 billion was also ahead of expectations but it was the guidance range for the current quarter, with a midpoint of $10.9 billion, that disappointed.

Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD)stock surged 28% to its highest in over a month after its continuing operations swung to a profit of $52.3 million in the three months through November, well ahead of forecasts. 
CEO Heyward Donigan attributed the improvement to ""tight expense control and prescription count growth in our retail pharmacies,"" noting that immunizations were particularly strong.
ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG) stock rose 7.9% to a three-month high after reporting better-than-expected results for the second quarter of its fiscal year. Sales rose nearly 20% thanks to the acquisition of Pinnacle, while organic net sales rose 1.6%.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court dismissed Anheuser-Busch InBev's (BR:ABI) appeal against a New Delhi city sales ban on Thursday, a blow to the world's largest brewer in one of its key market.
Authorities in New Delhi barred AB InBev in July from selling its beer for three years over allegations of evading state taxes, which the company has denied.
The Delhi city government's Commissioner of Excise later reduced the ban to 18 months. Authorities had found that SABMiller (LON:SAB), bought by AB InBev in 2016, used duplicate barcodes on beer bottles supplied to city retailers, allowing it to pay lower levies.
AB InBev, whose beers include Budweiser and Hoegaarden, is the second biggest player in India's $7 billion market, with a 17.5% share, IWSR Drinks Market Analysis estimates.
The Delhi ban is seen as a major setback for AB InBev, which is battling a separate Indian antitrust probe concerning alleged beer price fixing by SABMiller and other companies.
Justice Navin Chawla turned down requests to quash or put the ban on hold, saying AB InBev should lodge another appeal with senior New Delhi city officials.
""I am sending you back to the second appellate (authority),"" Chawla told AB InBev's lawyers in a packed Delhi courtroom.
During hearings in October and November, AB InBev's lawyer argued the city ban must be revoked as the company was not given adequate notice before it was imposed.
While summarizing his decision, Justice Chawla said the principle of natural justice had been violated when the Delhi government passed its first ban order. He did not elaborate and the order is not yet public.
AB InBev was ""encouraged"" by the judge's remarks which were a positive step towards resolving the inquiry, a spokesman said.
""We are committed to operating with integrity and ethics and we continue to be excited about our business in India,"" the AB InBev spokesman added.
However, Ramesh Singh, lead counsel for the Delhi government, said the judge dismissed AB InBev's case because the company had already started an appeals process and had been adequately heard by the Commissioner of Excise."

LONDON (Reuters) - Bond yields rose and Sweden's crown stayed ice cool on Thursday as the country became the first to raise interest rates out of sub-zero territory, while world stocks drifted off this week's record highs.
It was a packed day of central bank action all round. While Sweden made its big move, Norway sat tight on rates, and sterling pulled out of a dive even as two Bank of England policymakers pushed for a UK interest rate cut.
Stock markets stalled, however, after their rapid recent run-up and with a record-high Wall Street now facing the complexity of U.S. President Donald Trump's impeachment in Washington.
Wall Street futures (ESc1) pointed to a subdued start (N), while the pan-European index STOXX 600 (STXEc1) continued to dip in and out of the red, although Britain's blue-chip FTSE index (FTSE) did manage to hold a 0.2% rise. (EU) 
Asia has also pulled back from a 1-1/2 year peak.
The focus remained on the day's big milestone - Sweden ending five years of negative interest rates. The crown stayed calm after the move, rising as much as 0.2%. 
Bond yields rose across Europe though, with those in higher-rated countries such as Germany, France and the Netherlands up 3-4 bps on the day (FR10YT=RR) (NL10YT=RR).
Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield rose to -0.212% (DE10YT=RR), a new six-month high, pushing past a peak touched on Friday. 
Economists now wonder how Sweden's open economy will react and whether other central banks with sub-zero rates in the euro zone, Japan, Denmark, Switzerland and Hungary will consider following suit.
""This market doesn't look at macro and earnings, it just looks at monetary developments,"" said Stéphane Barbier de la Serre, macro strategist at Makor Capital Markets, referring to the huge role low interest rates have played in driving asset prices higher over the last decade.
""If the market thinks central banks (globally) are done with being dovish then we would see some volatility,"" he added.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said Sweden's hike showed it was throwing ""in the towel in a state of exasperation"" at the impact of negative rates, and ""neither because the economy is doing so well (on the contrary: the PMI is in free fall) nor because inflation justified (it)"".
POUND REBOUND
The British pound also gained after suffering heavy losses this week as concerns have returned that Britain could still crash out of the European Union without a trade deal in place when a transition period ends in December 2020.
Sterling  rose 0.2% to $1.3104 after falling more than 3%. It had reached an 18-month high on Dec. 13 after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party won a majority in a general election.
Against the euro, it stood at 84.99 pence (EURGBP=D3), close to its weakest since Dec. 4. [/FRX] British inflation remained at a three-year low in November, data had showed on Wednesday.
The Australian dollar jumped by 0.3% to $0.6879 after better-than-expected labor-market data made interest rate cuts less likely. The yen  barely moved from 109.58 per dollar after the Bank of Japan kept its quantitative easing in place and issued a gloomier assessment on factory output.
In Asia overnight, Japan's Nikkei (N225) fell 0.3% and China's stocks slipped (CSI300) for the second session despite trade optimism. Australian shares (AXJO) ended 0.3% lower, led lower by mining stocks.
Investors were also watching proceedings in Washington, where the Democratic-led House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Market reaction was limited, since the Republican-controlled Senate is very widely expected not to remove Trump from office.
In commodities, Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 0.1% to $66.26 per barrel. U.S. crude (CLc1) also gained 0.04% to $60.97 a barrel after U.S. government data showed a decline in crude inventories. 
Prices are likely to be supported by production cuts coming from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia.
Gold eased as optimism over U.S.-China trade ties offset political uncertainty over Trump's impeachment. Spot gold  dipped 0.1% to $1,474.64 per ounce.

Elsewhere, palladium  gained 0.5% to $1,934.08 per ounce. Prices of the auto catalyst metal hit an all-time peak of $1,998.43 on Tuesday, within a whisker of breaking above $2,000 for the first time due to a gaping supply deficit.

This is the first time CEO Charles Li has sold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) (HK:0388) during his nine years in the job.
The exchange operator has had a turbulent year. The company made an unsolicited $39 billion dollar bid for the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), in September. But the company was forced to withdraw the bid a month later after failing to convince LSE's management and investors to back the move.
HKEX's trading volumes and initial public offerings fell over the summer as Hong Kong was hit by months of anti-government protests.
But two multi-billion dollar listings in the autumn, Budweiser's Asia Pacific operations' (HK:1876) IPO and Alibaba's (HK:9988) secondary listing helped to push the exchange higher in fundraising league tables.
The Hong Kong exchange is in third place in global rankings for IPO fundraising this year, having raised $24.2 billion, behind Nasdaq and Riyadh, based on Refinitiv data. Riyadh's exchange recently launched the up-to $29 billion IPO of Saudi oil company Aramco (SE:2222).
Refinitiv league tables do not include secondary listings. If the  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) listing were included, Hong Kong would have topped the chart with $37.1 billion.
Li sold 650,000 HKEX shares at an average price of HK$256.53 ($32.90) a share on December 18, the exchange filing showed, bringing his stake down to 0.03% from 0.08%. HKEX did not say why Li had sold the shares.

BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) - China's  Dongfeng Motor Group  (HK:0489) and  Peugeot  maker PSA (PA:PEUP) are extending their business cooperation, despite the Chinese company reducing its stake in PSA to help smooth the French carmaker's merger with  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (FCA).
Dongfeng said on Thursday it had agreed with PSA to extend the duration of their joint venture Dongfeng Peugeot Citroen Automobiles (DPCA).
Under the deal, the venture could get the rights to PSA's new brands in China and will benefit from new technologies and intellectual properties, the Chinese company said.
PSA was not immediately available for comment.
The announcement comes a day after the companies said Dongfeng would reduce its 12.2% stake in PSA by selling 30.7 million shares to the French company.
Analysts said the move could smooth U.S. regulatory approval for PSA's roughly $50 billion merger with Italian-American carmaker FCA (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU).
The sale of Dongfeng's shares in PSA, worth around 680 million euros ($757 million), will leave the Chinese group holding around 4.5% of the merged PSA-FCA, which is set to become the world's fourth-biggest carmaker by sales volumes.
""As the cooperation between Dongfeng and PSA deepens, we expect the joint venture to continue making good progress in China,"" a Dongfeng representative said.
On a conference call, Dongfeng said DPCA would have exclusive rights to PSA's Opel cars should the partners agree to bring the brand to China, and enjoy lower prices on car parts imported from PSA.
Earlier this year, a document seen by Reuters showed Dongfeng and PSA plan to cut jobs at Wuhan-based DPCA and reduce its number of car plants to try to make the venture more profitable."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swatch will be blocked from selling some parts to watchmakers, ranging from Richemont's Cartier to Chopard and Breitling, from next year in an escalation of a row between the world's biggest watchmaker and Switzerland's competition regulator.
While anti-trust agency WEKO stopped short of an outright sales ban, it said on Thursday it had barred deliveries of so-called movements, the components which keep expensive mechanical timepieces ticking, to Swatch (S:UHR) customers from January.
""Companies that thought they would get movements from Swatch Group next year now have to scramble to find replacements,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said.
The anti-trust action could compound the problems facing Swiss watchmakers, with competition from smartwatches rising and demand in the key market of Hong Kong, slowing.
""Is there really going to be a shortage of watch movements? I'm not sure. There's also a gray market and brands have built inventories,"" WEKO director Patrik Ducrey told Reuters.
WEKO's ban is aimed at preventing Swatch from flooding the market with parts ahead of a final decision on the competitive landscape and Swatch's obligations in mid-2020.
The agency made an exception for small and mid-sized companies which are customers of ETA, which is one of the biggest suppliers of watch movements and owned by the group best known for its colorful plastic watches.
A Swatch spokesman said ETA sold most of its movements to big customers and it expected it would not be able to deliver any next year as a result of WEKO's action.
Shares in Swatch were down 1.8% by 1020 GMT.
TICKED OFF
Swatch gained its dominant position in movements when it was forged by the 1983 merger of the two main watchmakers to survive an influx of cheap battery-powered quartz watches from Asia.
A deal struck in 2013 at Swatch's request had it phase out movement deliveries by the end of 2019 and it would have been free to supply whomever it wanted from 2020.
But WEKO feared ETA could have tried to win back customers from alternative movement suppliers Sellita, Soprod, STP or Ronda, a document accompanying its decision showed.
Swatch viewed these concerns as unfounded, the document which was seen by Reuters, said.
Sellita did not respond to requests for comment and Richemont declined to comment.
Even if WEKO succeeds in breaking Swatch's dominant position in watch movements, the battle is likely to switch to Swatch's monopoly on ""assortments"", the centerpiece of each mechanical watch movement.
Swatch is obliged to deliver those to all its competitors, but the WEKO document states that Sellita complained in June that Swatch had not supplied it the desired assortments."

The verdict is another setback for the firm after it lost its licence to carry paying passengers in London last month, with the city's regulator claiming it had put passenger safety at risk.
In Germany, where Uber is active in seven cities including Frankfurt, Berlin and Munich, the company exclusively works with car rental companies and their licensed drivers. 
The verdict is effective immediately but can be appealed. ""We will assess the court's ruling and determine next steps to ensure our services in Germany continue"", an Uber spokesperson said. 
A person close to the company said that Uber will now change the way it operates in Europe's largest economy, adding that it is also considering taking legal action against the ruling. 
The plaintiff, Taxi Deutschland, said it would seek immediate provisional enforcement. It said Uber would then have to pay fines starting at 250 euros per ride and rising to as much as 250,000 euros per ride in the case of repeated offences.
The court in 2015 forbade Uber from matching up drivers using their own cars with ride hailers. Uber's current service, which lets customers hail rides carried out in rented cars, is also illegal as it violates competition rules, the court said.
Uber advertised rides to customers in a way that led them to view it as the provider of the transport service, the court said, adding that the firm also selects specific drivers and determines prices. 
""From a passenger's point of view, Uber provides the service itself and is therefore an entrepreneur,"" the presiding judge said, adding this meant Uber has to comply with laws governing passenger transport. 
Separately, Uber breached the obligation that hired cars have to return to a rental firm's main office after carrying out a ride, the court said. 
Uber has had a series of run-ins with regulators, courts and drivers around the world and has been shut out of markets such as Copenhagen and Hungary. 
Last week it submitted an appeal against a decision by London's transport regulator to strip the taxi app of its right to operate in one its most important markets.
Germany's highest court ruled in 2018 that a defunct limousine service offered by Uber was illegal. 

That upheld lower-court rulings in favor of a complaint brought by a Berlin taxi business that the so-called Uber Black service had violated German laws governing car rentals.

1343,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 06:41AM ET</span>","PG&E, Newsom Clash Over a Clause That May Allow State Takeover","(Bloomberg) -- A clause that would allow California to take over bankrupt utility giant PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG) under certain circumstances has emerged as a big sticking point in negotiations between the company and Governor Gavin Newsom.
Newsom wants the power company to include a provision in its reorganization proposal that would allow the state to take control of its assets if it fails to meet performance and safety metrics. Negotiating such a clause has become one of the biggest challenges in talks between the company and the governor’s office, people familiar with the situation said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
Newsom’s support is crucial to PG&E’s efforts to exit the biggest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history by a state-imposed deadline of June 30. The power giant filed for Chapter 11 in January after its power lines were tied to deadly blazes that erupted across Northern California in 2017 and 2018, leading to an estimated $30 billion in liabilities.
Now that PG&E has reached settlements with wildfire victims and their insurers -- two groups at the center of its reorganization -- Newsom’s sign-off becomes the biggest obstacle in the company’s efforts to get a restructuring deal done.
“The governor has been clear about the state’s requirements — a new and totally transformed entity that is accountable and prioritizes safety,” Newsom’s office said in a statement. “Critically important to that is ensuring that the new entity has the flexibility to fund this transformation. These points are not negotiable.”
PG&E intends to comply with the state’s requirements and will continue to address the demands raised by the governor in his letter, the San Francisco-based company said.
“PG&E has been engaged in constructive dialogue to address those concerns with the common objectives of having PG&E be safe, sound and financially stable upon emergence from Chapter 11,” the company said in its statement. “PG&E expects this dialogue to continue.”
The company’s shares rose 5% to $11.47 at 3:39 p.m. in New York.
Governor’s Approval
Any reorganization would have to be approved by a state utility commission that the governor appoints. And the company will have to prove to Newsom’s office that it has fully resolved its bankruptcy and past wildfire liabilities by June if it wants to participate in a new fire insurance fund to avoid future catastrophic losses.

Newsom has also ordered PG&E to replace its entire board and come up with a better financing plan that’s cost-neutral for its customers and isn’t so dependent on expensive short-term bridge financing. The company and the governor’s office are working on those demands, people familiar with the talks said.
Meanwhile, a rival restructuring plan being pitched by PG&E bondholders including Pacific Investment Management Co. and Elliott Management Corp. already includes a clause that would allow for a state takeover. But the option would only kick in if the company is found guilty of willful misconduct related to a future fire -- and only if the blaze burns than 5,000 buildings, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg.
The creditors’ plan hasn’t been approved in bankruptcy court or by the governor’s office and faces its own challenges."

The consortium, which also includes Bollore Africa Logistics (PA:BOLL) and Nippon Yusen Kaisha, will develop and operate a 600-metre quay and a new 21.2-hectare terminal for the import, export and transshipment of vehicles, an SCZone statement said.
It will invest $150 million in equipment and infrastructure to enable the terminal to handle 800,000 vehicles a year, plus an annual $233 million for the operating concession, the statement quoted SCZone chairman Yehia Zaki as saying.
East Port Said lies along the Mediterranean entrance to the Suez Canal, which is the fastest shipping route between Europe and Asia and one of the Egyptian government's main sources of foreign currency.
The government hopes to turn East Port Said into a major transshipment hub, meaning goods will flow through the facility on the way to other destinations."

The Wolfsburg-based group faces heavy investments into cleaner and self-driving technologies and is has increased sales share of higher-margin SUVs to help fund an industry-wide shift toward low emission vehicles.
VW's core brand in 2019 has gained market share and has increased its operating profit substantially, Chief Operating Officer Ralf Brandstaetter said on Wednesday in comments embargoed for Thursday.
He added the division had increased its share of SUVs sold to 42% in the United States and 37% in Europe.
Of envisaged cost savings of 3 billion euros by 2020, 2.6 billion euros have been realized at the end of 2019, Brandstaetter said.

LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Regulators need to get a fuller picture of the growing market for loans to highly-indebted companies, Financial Stability Board (FSB) Chair Randal Quarles said on Thursday.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who Quarles succeeded at the FSB, has likened the market to subprime mortgages that defaulted a decade ago, triggering a global financial crisis.
Just a few global banks, mainly in the United States and the European Union, account for 86% of collateralized loan obligations (CLO) issued, Quarles told Reuters as the FSB published a review of the sector.
Quarles said the FSB report was a stock take and the next step was for regulators in each jurisdiction to consider whether action is needed on the basis of this agreed data.
With no single definition of a leveraged loan, the FSB estimated that a year ago the overall market was worth between $1.4 trillion and $3.2 trillion.
But while regulators have data on most of the world's leveraged loan and CLO market, the remaining $106 billion is held by insurers and investment firms where data is too thin to give a clear picture, the FSB said.
Non-banks tend to hold the riskiest loans and there is little information on the links between them and global banks, the FSB said, adding that while open-ended funds have invested in such loans there is no sign of redemptions causing strain.
""I view this as a glass 86% full as opposed to 14% empty,"" said Quarles, who is also the top financial supervisor at the Federal Reserve.
(FSB Graphic - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/10169/10080/FSBCLOGraphic2.png)
Quarles said leveraged loans are not a threat to U.S. financial stability, and that banks hold far more capital and liquidity than they did before the financial crisis when many were bailed out by taxpayers.
""It would be premature to draw any view about what the final conclusion might be. We want to make sure we have got the data,"" Quarles said
The Fed and other U.S. regulators have already taken a closer look at softening loan underwriting standards ""to ensure that erosion doesn't continue"" Quarles said.
""We have pushed back against that,"" he added.
The FSB said market supervisors in many jurisdictions have already launched data collections.

1348,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 05:24AM ET</span>",StockBeat: NMC Health's Bluster Fails to Convince,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Wednesday's bounce in NMC Health (LON:NMC) looks to have been of the 'dead cat' variety.
Shares in the UAE-focused FTSE 100 member fell 9.6% in early trading in London on Thursday, back to the three-year low that they hit on Tuesday in response to an explosive new report by short-seller Muddy Waters Research.
The movement illustrates the limitations of NMC’s first response to the report, which seemed guided by the principle that enough long words taken from a quick look at a thesaurus will make the problem go away.
NMC had said on Wednesday it “will review the assertions, insinuations and accusations made in the report, which appear principally unfounded, baseless and misleading, containing many errors of fact, and will respond in detail in due course.”
It said it ""understands its regulatory disclosure obligations and has nothing to add to disclosures already made. It has already responded to many of the allegations made in the report over the past 12 months.""
The shares had fallen over 32% on Tuesday as Muddy Waters, owned by Carson Block, said it had “serious doubts about the company’s financial statements, including its asset values, cash balance, reported profits, and reported debt levels.”
Block drew attention to – among other things - what he considered to be serious overpayment for contractors ultimately controlled by parties related to NMC, and to a financing facility arranged by another related party, details of which the company has now removed from its website.
“We are unsure how deep the rot at NMC goes, but we do not believe that its insiders or financials can be trusted,” Block said.
NMC had had a terrific run from 2015 to 2018, capitalizing on booming demand for healthcare in a region where pockets of affluence are expanding. However, its shares had already peaked in the middle of last year, like many emerging-market stocks that ultimately depend on a benign global backdrop.
Already in August there had been suggestions that all was not as it seemed. When it was rumored that Muddy Waters would soon announce a new short position, many guessed it would be NMC, only for the blow to fall on litigation funder Burford Capital (LON:BURF). Burford is still down 50% from its previous levels, suggesting that when Block hits you, you stay hit.
Nor was Block the first to raise questions about NMC. Jefferies analyst James Vane-Tempest has had an underweight recommendation for months. A Reuters report citing unnamed sources in August about potential Chinese interest in buying a stake held by two long-term shareholders has come to nothing, also prompting doubts as to the reliability of information coming out of the company.
As noted above, NMC’s position is that it has already answered these questions once. However, the market reaction shows that those answers clearly haven’t convinced everyone. NMC has a hard slog ahead of it."

Speaking ahead of a meeting between Fiat Chrysler's (FCA) management and Italian union representatives on Friday, Conte said the deal should have no negative impact on jobs.

Unions have also welcomed the decision of the two automakers to include two union representatives - one from Italy and one from France - on the 11-strong board of the merged group.
Analysts expect the companies' factories in Europe, which stretch from Portugal to Britain, to draw scrutiny because they have overlapping brands and underutilized factories.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank-controlled Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Japan has pulled out of a Japanese apartment rental venture with Oyo Hotels and Homes, in the latest setback for the loss-making Indian startup.
Yahoo Japan said it exited the venture Oyo Life, in which it had a 33.9% stake, to focus on other initiatives. The internet firm has led a wave of consolidation in Japan this year, buying online fashion retailer Zozo Inc (T:3092) and scooping up messaging app operator Line Corp (T:3938).
Oyo, also backed by SoftBank Group (T:9984), on Thursday said it has bought the Oyo Life shares held by Yahoo Japan, now known as Z Holdings (T:4689), for an undisclosed amount.
Oyo expanded rapidly in India and abroad by promising to drive up hotel occupancy through its online booking system, but has faced pushback from hoteliers who say they have been blindsided by hidden fees.
The startup has been forced to relax expansion targets in Japan, where it also launched a platform for hotel reservations this year and faced complaints over its booking system and unmet promises of payment for room renovations.
SoftBank, however, remains invested in Oyo's Japan hotel business, which has expanded by offering hotels minimum revenue guarantees, with Vision Fund and wireless unit SoftBank Corp (T:9434) retaining stakes.
But with pricing dictated by Oyo's algorithm, which frequently slashes room fees, hotels have complained of weak revenue growth despite higher occupancy rates.
Apartment rental service Oyo Life launched pledging to simplify Japan's complicated room rental process by allowing users to rent through its one-stop website.
With Oyo often using intermediaries and then subleasing properties, costs must be clawed back through monthly rental and maintenance fees.
Yahoo Japan's exit from the apartment rental venture comes amid widening losses in India for Oyo and projections it may not make a profit there and in China until 2022.
Helmed by 26-year old founder Ritesh Agarwal, Oyo is just one SoftBank-backed startup where the tech conglomerate's cash injection has fueled rapid growth but that is under pressure to demonstrate a path to profitability."

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 02:37AM ET</span>",Exclusive: BP's incoming CEO won't initially take up Rosneft board seat - company sources,"By Ron Bousso, Darya Korsunskaya and Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Incoming Chief Executive Bernard Looney will not take up either of BP's seats on the board of Rosneft when he takes over in February because of the complexity of the relationship with the Russian oil giant, five company sources said.
Under an arrangement between Looney and outgoing Chief Executive Bob Dudley, Dudley will keep one of the seats when he retires in March, the sources said.
Guillermo Quintero, a Venezuelan national who is also a former  BP  (LON:BP) executive and has ties to the South American country's national oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], will keep the other seat, they said.
The sources said Rosneft had been informed of the arrangement but did not say how long it was expected to last.
BP owns nearly a fifth of Rosneft, its biggest foreign investment and the source of a third of its total output.
But Looney has not worked in Russia and cannot rival 64-year-old Dudley's long experience of working in and with the country and his deep ties with Rosneft, the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""Dudley will stay on the board of Rosneft because the relationship between BP and Moscow is very complicated,"" a senior BP official told Reuters.
Looney's decision not to take either of the board seats has not been previously reported. Dudley said in October he would stay on the Rosneft board after retiring in March, but did not explain why. 
""With his unrivalled experience of both the international oil industry and Russia, Bob will continue to provide valuable experience on the Rosneft Board,"" BP said in a statement to Reuters.
Quintero's ties to Venezuela are also important for Rosneft, as the Russian company became an important buyer of oil from the country after it was hit by sanctions by Washington. 
Rosneft did not reply to a written request for comment. 
Dudley is chairman of Rosneft's strategic planning committee which focuses on long-term development and sustainability issues, according to Rosneft's 2018 annual report.
He and Quintero regularly take part in Rosneft board discussions and vote on topics ranging from long-term strategy to dividend payments to shareholders, including BP.
It is unclear whether either will receive remuneration from BP for sitting on the Rosneft board. Neither Dudley nor Quintero hold shares in Rosneft and neither received remuneration from Rosneft last year, according to the 2018 annual report. 
SANCTIONS FACTOR
Looney is taking the helm at BP at a time when oil companies are under pressure from investors to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and reduce carbon emissions from operations. 
The arrangement with Dudley will keep Looney at arm's length from Rosneft and Russia. A Rosneft source said this could be beneficial for Looney as the United States and the European Union have imposed economic sanctions on Russia and Rosneft over Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. 
""From a sanctions point of view, the fact that BP's new CEO will not be a board member is even good, allowing him to distance himself a bit (from Rosneft),"" a senior source close to Rosneft said. ""Dudley is trusted by BP, he is an insider. He is friends with (Rosneft CEO Igor) Sechin, too, which is good for Rosneft.""
Dudley first worked in Russia in 1994 and was later CEO of TNK-BP, a joint venture with a group backed by four Russian oligarchs that turned sour - forcing Dudley at one time to flee Russia - but was eventually sold to Rosneft in 2011, giving BP a 19.75% stake in the oil giant and two board seats. 
He was pivotal in navigating BP's Russian operations through the fallout from Crimea and his lobbying for Rosneft has helped serve BP's interests. 
In a previously unreported letter dating from February 2019 seen by Reuters, Dudley asked Putin to grant Rosneft tax breaks to develop a major project in Russia.
""Russian companies have limited opportunities to compete against U.S. producers and maintain their share of the global market,"" Dudley wrote. 
His efforts complemented lobbying by Sechin and Russia's energy minister to help Rosneft compete against other global oil producers, especially the expanding U.S. shale industry.
Tax breaks would also help compensate Russian companies for any losses resulting from Russia's participation since 2017 in a pact with OPEC to cut output, Dudley said in the letter.
Dudley ended the letter with a request to grant tax incentives for the Priobskoye license block, which produces around 500,000 barrels of oil per day, or about 5% of Russia’s total. No decision has been taken yet. 
BP is a shale producer, and the letter was written about three months after BP completed the $10.5 billion purchase of U.S. shale assets from BHP. 
BP declined comment on the letter.

Jing will remain executive chairman of Ant Financial, a position he had held concurrently with the CEO title.
Hu joined Alibaba Group in 2005 and served as president of Ant Financial since November 2018. Before that, he held positions in Alibaba's cloud computing and SME loan divisions.
Hu will report to Jing, Ant Financial said.
The new appointment at Ant Financial comes as the division, which handles hundreds of billions of yuan in online transactions via its payment service Alipay, faces a long-awaited IPO.
In September, Alibaba won regulatory approval to purchase 33% of Ant Financial in exchange for rights to 37.5% of Alibaba's profits.
Analysts speculated the restructuring marked a major step toward a listing. But in September, Ant Financial's president of its international division Douglas Feagin told CNBC the company had no timetable for an IPO.
At the same time, Ant Financial Chief Technology Officer Cheng Li will replace Jeff Zhang as the CTO of Alibaba, according to an internal company letter seen by Reuters.
Jeff Zhang will remain the chairman of the Alibaba Technology Committee, Dean of Alibaba's DAMO Academy and president of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence, the letter added, which was written and signed by Alibaba Group CEO Daniel Zhang.
The letter also stated that Jiang Fan, president of Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall e-commerce sites, will also oversee the company's Alimama advertising unit.
""From where we stand today, we can clearly see the need for multiple business groups to have complex collaborations in each of our strategic pillars in order to win success,"" Daniel Zhang wrote in the memo.
The appointments mark the biggest shake-up at Alibaba's executive levels since June, when the company announced that CFO Maggie Wu would replace executive vice chairman Joe Tsai as head of Alibaba's strategic investment unit."

1373,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 02:03AM ET</span>",Don’t Expect Another Roaring Year for Asia-Pacific Stock Darling,"(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand equities will find it hard to match the stellar run they have had this year.
After a record 29% rally in 2019, the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 Gross Index is poised to give in to gravity as earnings stagnate. UBS Group AG sees it climbing to just 11,780 by the end of 2020, or 4% above the last close.
The surge this year was mostly due to relaxed monetary policy across the globe, with New Zealand leading the dovish trend by being the first developed-market economy to cut interest rates this cycle. The boost came at the right time to support the market, just as corporate earnings dwindled. Low rates offsetting poor fundamentals is likely to be the theme carrying over to 2020.
Ongoing profit downgrades, combined with a tepid domestic economy point to “largely non-existent” earnings growth of 1% next year, UBS Group AG analysts led by Jeremy Kincaid wrote in a Dec. 3 note. Possible acquisitions, the potential closure of  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group’s aluminum smelter and a federal election are all factors that could weigh on equities, they said.
“Like most equity gauges across the globe, upside in Kiwi stocks has been supported by accommodative RBNZ policy, rather than a terribly strong earnings growth outlook,” said Kyle Rodda, an analyst at IG Markets Ltd. in Melbourne. Still, an improved U.S.-China trade outlook “has and will have a significant impact” on the shares, and a pickup in China’s economy would go a long way to lift up the market, as the country’s exports have been hit by weakened Chinese demand, he added.
New Zealand’s economy also grew at a faster pace in the third quarter, suggesting its slowdown is over. Frances Sweetman, a senior analyst at Milford Asset Management, sees some glimmers of hope in the domestic economy. Increased confidence in the housing market and government plans to boost infrastructure spending could bolster the shares, she said.
But not like this year.
“We don’t expect the share market to perform as well next year,” said Sweetman from Auckland. “It should still be a reasonable performance.”

The index compiler will include the MSCI Kuwait index in the Emerging Market Index in one phase during the May 2020 semi-annual index review, it said in a statement late on Wednesday.
Sebastien Lieblich, Global Head of Index Solutions and Chairman of the MSCI equity index committee, said: ""Kuwait's addition adds further diversification to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index with an estimated weight of 0.69%.""
The upgrade follows Kuwait's implementation of regulatory and operational enhancements in the Kuwaiti equity market, such as introducing omnibus accounts that would allow foreign investors to trade while remaining anonymous, offering the same privileges that local investors now have.
Oil-rich Kuwait wants to strengthen its position as a regional financial center and give the private sector a stronger role in the economy.
Inclusion in a benchmark index attracts inflows from ""passive investors"" who track those indexes. Dubai-based Arqaam Capital said in a note it estimates the inclusion will generate about $2.7 billion in net passive inflows.
Beyond that, the inclusion may also generate up to $7 billion in interest from active investors, according to the Kuwait and Middle East Financial Investment Company (KMEFIC), an asset management firm.
The Saudi stock exchange, the region's largest market, completed the second and final phase of joining the MSCI Emerging Markets Index earlier this year, garnering inflows worth billions of dollars.
""Using the comparison, Kuwait might experience a large performance boost in the first half of 2020 due to buy side pressure,"" said Abdullah Albusairi at KMEFIC.
The Kuwaiti benchmark premier index rose 30% this year, outperforming regional peers in anticipation of the MSCI upgrade. It was up 0.3% in early trade on Thursday."

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 12:48AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India's NTPC snubs foreign emissions tech, shuts out GE, others from $2 billion orders","By Sudarshan Varadhan
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Top Indian electricity generator NTPC has rejected the emissions-cutting technology of GE and other foreign firms for its coal-fired plants, documents show, shutting them out of an estimated $2 billion in orders.
Despite struggling with some of the world's worst air pollution levels, India has already pushed back a deadline to cut emission levels to up to 2022, after extensive lobbying by power producers who cited high costs and technical difficulties.
The rejection of the foreign technology comes at a time when over half of coal-fired plants in India are already set to miss a phased deadline starting Dec. 2019 to cut emissions of lung diseases-causing sulphur oxides.
State-run NTPC, which generates a quarter of India's electricity, held talks with foreign firms including  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, Norway-based Yara International and Japan-based Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems over the potential purchase of filters that lower emissions of smog-causing nitrogen oxide.
However, none of the pilot tests it conducted met key emissions parameters, NTPC said in a presentation submitted last month to the Central Pollution Control Board.
""The pilot tests concluded that both selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technologies currently available are not suitable for installation at power plants in India,"" it said in the presentation reviewed by Reuters, referring to technologies used to cut emissions of nitrogen oxides.
Thermal power companies produce three-quarters of the country's electricity and account for some 80% of India's industrial emissions of sulphur oxides that cause lung diseases and smog-creating nitrogen oxides.
NTPC had presented cost estimates in 2016 for the installation of the technology to cut nitrogen oxides throughout its network of power plants. According to Reuters calculations based on those estimates, the cost would total $2.4 billion, although industry consultants said recently that those costs could now be 25% lower.
The utility wants a dilution in nitrogen oxide emissions standards and claimed in last month's presentation that the lowered standards can be achieved with minor retrofits, without the need to install new equipment.
PILOT TESTS
The pollution board held a stakeholder meeting on Nov. 7, an audio recording of which was reviewed by Reuters. In the meeting, GE and Yara representatives rejected NTPC's views, saying their technologies were proven worldwide, according to the recording and two sources present at the meeting. NTPC did not attend the meeting.
NTPC, and the Indian units of GE and Yara did not respond to detailed Reuters questionnaires seeking comment. Mitsubishi Hitachi did not immediately respond to a request for comment made on its website.
NTPC said in the earlier presentation to the pollution board that high ash content in Indian coal posed challenges to installing SCR technology and that SNCR did not meet key parameters.
The foreign companies responded, saying pilot tests were run in a constrained environment and that commercial use of the equipment, which requires some changes to the plant, would cut emissions to the required levels.
""The conditions for the (pilot) test was that we can't touch special parts at all, we can't touch furnace tubes. NTPC did not allow us,"" Senthilvel Rangasamy, a GE representative, said in the meeting.
Premchand Talreja, the managing director of the Indian unit of Yara, said the pilot tests achieved the desired results.
""There should not be doubt on the technology itself,"" Talreja said in the meeting.
Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and previously a member of a European Union technical working group on emissions by coal-fired utilities, said India has failed to curtail emissions due to ""delay and misinformation tactics by the power industry"".
""The power industry managed to build a myth that Indian coal is so special that technologies proven on a wide range of coal types elsewhere need to be tested and validated again in India before the standards can be implemented,"" Myllyvirta told Reuters."

Greece holds a 55% stake in the airport and 10 investment schemes submitted expressions of interest for the 30% stake on sale in October.
Germany-based AviAlliance GmbH, owned by Canadian pension investor PSP Investments, holds a 40% stake in the airport and Greece's Copelouzos the rest.
""The first evaluation shows that the bids are good,"" the agency's chief Aris Xenofos told reporters. ""We believe that a big part (of them) will move ahead.""
After that stage, the agency is expected to invite shortlisted investors to submit binding bids by April 2020, said a report published by the country's EU lenders last month.
The sale is crucial for Greece, which emerged from international bailouts in 2018. The country is aiming for privatization receipts of 2.4 billion euro in 2020, a goal which is ""feasible"", Xenofos said.
Greece has raised 1.2 billion euros from state asset sales this year. In total, it has received 7 billion euros from privatizations since 2010.
The conservative government that came to power in July has promised its lenders, who monitor its progress, to speed up privatizations to attract investment and stimulate growth after a decade-long debt crisis.
The state is also considering a sale of its 35.5% stake in the country's biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum via the Athens Stock Exchange (AT:HEPr).
Its previous effort to sell a 50.1% in Hellenic jointly with the refiner's biggest shareholder, Paneuropean Oil and Industrial Holding, stalled in April as no binding bids were submitted.
Xenofos said the sale still hinged on market conditions.
""We have our antennas out,"" he said. ""We are on guard but it's the market which will give us the signal on the interest which may be expressed or on the price."""

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 09:51PM ET</span>",CITIC poised to beat Goldman to become first China firm to lead Asia equity rankings,"By Jennifer Hughes and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - CITIC Securities looks set to become the first Chinese firm to top annual equity capital markets (ECM) rankings for Asia-Pacific excluding Japan this year, a nose ahead of Goldman Sachs (N:GS), according to data from Refinitiv.
Goldman,  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and other western banks have traditionally battled for top spot in the region, where ECM activity averages an outsized 34% of the investment banking fee pool, compared with 25% globally.
State-backed CITIC Securities (SS:600030) (HK:6030), China's biggest brokerage, has so far this year won $15.7 billion credit for deals it and Hong Kong-based unit CLSA have worked on, according to Refinitiv.
Goldman has $15.4 billion credit, while China International Capital Corp (CICC) (HK:3908) was third with $14.7 billion and Morgan Stanley fourth with $14.3 billion.
Last year Goldman was first while CITIC Securities was seventh.
CITIC Securities and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
The league tables split credit for each deal between all banks involved regardless of the seniority of their roles. A top rank requires work on many deals.
CITIC's leading role underscores the growing importance of deals involving mainland Chinese companies, an area that domestic players dominate.
""China has always been a big part of the whole Asia-Pacific deal issuance,"" said a Hong Kong-based senior ECM banker at a global bank. ""Next year is going to be similar to this year.""
CITIC's biggest deals this year include leading Shanghai Pudong Development Bank's $7.1 billion convertible bond sale and a $5.9 billion convertible bond deal, alongside Goldman's China unit and UBS, for sister company China CITIC Bank.
Overall, across Asia Pacific including Japan, ECM volumes fell 11% to $251.2 billion in 2019. But convertible bond sales jumped 44% to $52.9 billion, according to Refinitiv. Follow-on share sales were worth $130.2 billion, down just 4%.
""2018 was much more skewed towards IPOs. This year, the IPOs, follow-ons and equity-linked deals are quite balanced,"" said the ECM banker. ""From a product perspective, next year is going to be quite balanced too.""
Calculating Asia rankings is complicated by the region's disparate markets. Include Japan, which many banks operate separately from their regional units, and Morgan Stanley tops the table. It is helped by its relationship with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (T:8306), which owns 23.4% of the U.S. firm.
Morgan Stanley's biggest Asia deals were in Hong Kong through its involvement in Alibaba's $12.9 billion listing and the $5.7 billion spin-off of Anheuser-Busch InBev's (BR:ABI) Asian business. But it also notched up Tokyo-based deals worth $9.9 billion compared to $5.4 billion for Goldman."
1381,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 08:40PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for Dec. 19,"Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock the markets tomorrow.
1. Trump Impeached
The House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump Wednesday, as expected. Trump is the third president to be impeached in U.S. history.
While the markets haven’t been swayed much at all by the impeachment saga – especially given Trump is almost guaranteed to survive a trial in the GOP-led Senate – trading was particularly quiet today as the impeachment debate went on.
Often when big political events occur investors have one eye on the TV and one on the trading screen, so muted volume could be the order of the day at the open tomorrow as well as the talking heads talk about the next steps.
As far as the numbers, S&P 500 futures were little changed just after the vote came in.
Also on the political landscape, healthcare stocks will be active after a federal appeals court ruled unconstitutional the individual mandate that citizens must have health insurance, which is part of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare).
The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the mandate was in the taxing power of Congress, but a Texas court ruled that was no longer applicable given that the penalty for not having insurance was later lowered to zero dollars.
The appeals court the Texas court would have to rule if the law could stand without the mandate.
2. Housing and Manufacturing Numbers Arrive Again
There are a host of economic indicators for the market to digest tomorrow. Housing and manufacturing drove stocks higher earlier this week and get a change to again.
At 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT), the National Association of Realtors will report on existing home sales for November.
Sales of existing homes are expected to have dropped 0.2% last month to an annual rate of 5.44 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At 8:30 AM ET, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve will release its manufacturing index for December.
Economists expect the Philly Fed Index to come in at 8 for the month from 10.4 in November. The index tracks manufacturing in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.
Initial jobless claims arrive at the same time. Economists are looking for a drop in claims for first-time unemployment benefits to 225,000.
3. Nike Ready to Release Results
Athleticwear giant   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) will report earnings after the close of trading tomorrow.
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) is expected to report a quarterly profit of 58 cents per share on sales of almost $10.1 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Needham boosted its price target on the stock this week to $105 per share from $98 per share.
 “We think NKE is benefitting from ongoing structural changes in the sales mix towards Direct as well as product innovation, especially for price points (below) $100,” Needham said, according to Briefing.com. “We expect its performance in China and EMEA will get a boost from its app launches.
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) shares were up 0.9% on Wednesday and are up 35.6% this year, seventh-best among the 30 Dow stocks."
1382,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 07:05PM ET</span>",China’s Got a Chip on Its Shoulder,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- From sanctions to export restrictions, the rest of the world views China’s chip champions like Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. with suspicion and skepticism. But inside the country, all investors see is a $300 billion-a-year golden opportunity. One could almost say that the Chinese have a chip on the shoulder by rewarding semiconductor startups with such a vengeance. 
Companies that have anything to do with the industry are among the year’s best performers. Of the 44 names classified as semiconductor stocks by the widely followed local index provider SWS Research, the average gain is a whopping 170%. They command $128 billion of market cap, backed by only $15.5 billion of annual sales.
Brokers have been busy selling clients on the notion of import substitution. Last year, China imported $312 billion worth of integrated circuits, surpassing $300 billion for the first time. They’re the largest import category, accounting for 15% of the total pie and topping crude oil for the fourth consecutive year.So, the thinking goes, if the U.S. and its allies restrict chip component sales, big clients such as Huawei, which makes smartphones and 5G network equipment, will have no choice but to turn to domestic suppliers. Pile in now and wait for Donald Trump and trade nationalism to do the rest.
At the same time, pricing power is gradually shifting back to chipmakers. Pinched by the U.S.-China trade war and the global economic slowdown that has ensued partly because of it, movers and shakers in the chip world have cut back their capital expenses. As a result, prices of memory chips have stabilized recently.
We may start to see a price rebound in DRAM memory chips used in computer servers in early 2020, according to  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA). On Wednesday in the U.S., Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). gave a strong sales forecast for the December quarter and told investors the worst of a slump in the memory chip industry is over. This seems like a global consensus. Share prices of South Korea’s Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. and SK Hynix Inc., for instance, soared lately. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index reached a record high. Seen in this context, perhaps Chinese chips’ melt-up isn’t all that extraordinary.
There’s a big problem with this investment thesis, however. The $300 billion-a-year import substitution argument is essentially a bet on the total addressable market, a favorite phrase used in consulting firms’ case interviews. But when was the last time a Chinese company managed to capture a good portion of its market?The furthest China’s industrial sector has gotten toward an oligopoly is with its air-conditioner makers, and even these players — Midea Group Co. and Gree Electric Appliances Inc. of Zhuhai — don’t skip a beat in luring each other’s customers away. It’s rare in China when a few big companies dominate. Wherever there’s a golden nest, thousands enter and erode away any pricing power. So, what really is the quality of the stocks for investors if all they see are big sales numbers, but tiny profit margins?
With Beijing actively promoting its nascent startups with state funds, it’s just a matter of time before China Inc. ruins the healthy supply and demand dynamics, not unlike what it did to the solar industry. Three-year-old Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., managed by the business arm of the prestigious Tsinghua University, President Xi Jinping’s alma mater, is only half a generation behind the global NAND flash memory leaders. Meanwhile, every business entity, including local government financing vehicles, is edging into chip making because it’s close to Xi’s heart and therefore to state-owned bank vaults. 
China is a huge market, with billions of dollars of opportunities opening up every year. But it’s also a place defined by its profitless prosperity, with companies battling like gladiators to their own demise. Investing based on the size of the overall arena completely misses that bloody reality. 
(Adds Micron’s sales forecast in the sixth paragraph.)"
1383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 06:41PM ET</span>","Trade, Trump and Protests: A Guide to the Main EM Risks in 2020","(Bloomberg) -- A jump of almost $3 trillion in stock-market valuation this year, currency volatility at a five-year low and bond spreads at their narrowest level in almost three years.
On the surface, emerging markets are ending 2019 with a spring in their step.
Look under the hood, though, and many pitfalls await investors, from the U.S. election to an upsurge of popular unrest across Latin America and the lingering worries over trade wars. Never mind country-specific issues such as rising defaults in the Chinese domestic bond market, slowing growth in India and the deepening crisis at South Africa’s state power company, Eskom.
The competing narratives in a sector that accounts for 60% of the global economy are well-illustrated by the divergence in outlooks. UBS AG says riskier assets will produce only moderate returns in 2020. But  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. are bullish on developing-nation stocks, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is betting that bonds are poised to rally.
The U.S.-China trade dispute and Brexit “dominated and drove markets” in 2019, said David Woo, the Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) strategist who a year ago said he wouldn’t touch emerging markets with a “10-foot pole.”
“This year will be about the dissipation of these policy uncertainties, and this should provide a boost to global growth by releasing pent-up demand as companies rebuild inventory and resume capital expenditures,” said Woo, who heads the bank’s rates, currencies and emerging-market fixed-income strategy from New York.
For  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), which was optimistic about emerging-market assets earlier in 2019, tougher times loom.
“Heading into 2020, the conditions are not seen coming together for EM currencies to stage a broad-based recovery,” said analysts including Hong Kong-based Paul Mackel and Ju Wang. “It will be another frustrating year.”
Trade Wars
As in 2019, emerging-market investors will watch how the U.S. and China’s relationship develops. There are many who doubt this month’s so-called phase-one agreement will lead to much progress over deeper problems such as Washington’s displeasure over Beijing’s vast web of industrial subsidies.
Any signal that tension between the two sides is worsening will hit developing-nation assets hard, not least China’s yuan.
“The outcome of the U.S.-China trade war is crucial to the outlook for emerging markets in 2020,” said Bank of America.
Fed and the Dollar
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell buoyed emerging-market assets last week when he suggested the central bank would hold off from raising interest rates until at least 2021. If that happens, it should keep the dollar in check and ensure plenty of capital still flows to emerging markets.
But if an unexpected acceleration in U.S. inflation prompts the Fed to change plan, or other major central banks suddenly turn hawkish, that could push up core rates and squeeze the spreads on developing-nation bonds. The extra yield investors get when buying sovereign dollar bonds in emerging markets rather than U.S. Treasuries is already at the lowest since April 2018, with the gap falling below 300 basis points this month, according to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
Slowing Growth
The International Monetary Fund reckons emerging-market economies will expand 4.6% next year, almost three times as fast as developed nations. Still, growth in China and India is slowing, which will hurt emerging economies as a whole, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
“EM potential growth rates are falling,” said analysts including David Lubin in London and Dirk Willer in New York. This “raises questions about asset prices, and particularly foreign exchange,” they said.
The good news, according to Goldman, is that Brazil, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and other nations still have room to loosen monetary policy, at least in the short term. The bank says this will boost company earnings and help emerging equities generate a total return of 11% in 2020.
“A number of emerging-market central banks can cut rates further in the coming months, though the number of cutters will diminish as the year progresses,” said Goldman economists including Hong Kong-based Andrew Tilton.
Waning Carry Trade
The hunt for higher yields will probably continue in 2020, especially with central banks in developed economies still dovish. But the drop in rates on local-currency bonds this year means the appeal of the emerging-market carry trade might start to wane.
The average yield on local bonds in developing nations has decreased to 4.2%, the lowest in more than a decade, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Indexes.
Investors still keen on the carry trade may have to turn to some of the riskier currencies.  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA recommends the Egyptian pound and Nigerian naira, where foreigners can get bond yields of more than 12%. Bank of America likes the Kazakh tenge.
White House Race
The Democratic primaries and the U.S. presidential vote on Nov. 3 could rock global markets. Most analysts say it’s too early to tell whether emerging-market assets would benefit from Donald Trump winning a second term or from someone else entering the White House.
“Trump has presided over an acrimonious trade dispute with China, but also an equity market that has gained 45%,” said SocGen analysts including Jason Daw in Singapore. “Whether another Trump presidency or a Democrat leader would be good or bad for financial markets is an open question, but there will be effects on policy and sentiment before and after the election.”
Latin American Unrest
The region has been rocked by protests from Chile to Ecuador, Bolivia and Colombia over everything from inequality to corruption. Latin America’s Eurobonds have rallied since the start of December, but they’re still lagging behind those of other emerging-market regions over the past six months.
“In 2020, anger against governments will not go away,” said Citigroup economists including Dana Peterson, who’s based in New York. “Politics will matter much in LatAm and will drive much of the trading around the region.”
Citigroup doubts the two biggest economies -- Brazil and Mexico -- will offer investors much respite, even if protests don’t spread there. In Brazil, political infighting will probably slow President Jair Bolsonaro’s tax reforms, while Mexico’s fiscal situation may deteriorate with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador potentially ramping up spending to buoy the struggling economy, Citigroup says.
Government Defaults
Sovereign defaults have been rare in emerging markets in recent years. But in 2020 more countries could join Venezuela, which defaulted two years ago. Markets are most nervous about Argentina, Lebanon and Zambia.
Argentina’s currency and bonds plummeted in early August when Alberto Fernandez’s surprise victory in a primary vote put the leftist on course for the presidency. Fernandez, who was sworn in this month, has signaled he will open talks with creditors to delay debt payments. Harvard University economist Carmen Reinhart says this restructuring battle would be even nastier than Argentina’s last one, which dragged on for 15 years after its 2001 default.
Lebanon has been without a government since protesters forced Prime Minister Saad Hariri to resign in late October. Its next Eurobond is due in early March. Even if it pays that one, markets doubt the country can hold out indefinitely. Its dollar yields have soared to an average of 30% and many of its bonds trade below 50 cents, suggesting investors expect heavy write-offs.
Zambia’s Eurobond yields have climbed to almost 20% amid a slowing economy and worsening power cuts. Investors say it probably needs a bailout from the IMF, though the government seems reluctant to accept the conditions that would come with that."
1384,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 06:26PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Freddie Mac offers early retirement to 25% of workforce - sources,"By Michelle Price and Lauren Tara LaCapra
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Freddie Mac has offered early retirement to around 25% of its staff as it begins to overhaul its workforce amid a broader push by the Trump administration to reform the housing finance giant, according to four people briefed on the matter. 
The company has offered the packages to 1,650 eligible employees, although it expects around one quarter or just over 6% of its workforce to take the buyout, one of the people said. 
Two of the sources briefed on the matter said that the early retirement program had been communicated to staff who are eligible. Reuters could not ascertain how many people had so far taken the buyout. 
""As is common in many American companies, Freddie Mac is offering employees who meet certain age and tenure requirements a voluntary opportunity to retire early. As we prepare for our next chapter, we anticipate this will help realign our workforce to create a company attractive to outside investors as well as current and future employees,"" a spokesman for Freddie Mac said in an email statement.
Freddie and its fellow government-sponsored enterprise Fannie Mae were bailed out in 2008 during the subprime mortgage crisis. In September, the Trump administration, led by the U.S. Treasury Department, unveiled a long-awaited blueprint to remove the pair - which guarantee over half of the nation's mortgages - from government control in coming years.
In the meantime, the Treasury and the regulator for Fannie and Freddie, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), have called for the pair to shrink their business footprint, review their operations, and rebuild their capital reserves.
A spokesman for FHFA declined to comment on Freddie Mac's staffing plans.
""The mortgage finance reform conversation has moved away from Congress and is squarely entrenched in the administrative sphere,"" Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a note on general housing finance reform on Wednesday. 
Freddie Mac has discussed its strategy, including potentially cutting headcount, with outside consulting firms, according to a fifth person involved in those discussions.
The company's staffing levels have grown by around a third during its conservatorship, under which the majority of its profits, until recently, have been passed to the Treasury. 
As of February 2019, Freddie Mac had 6,600 full-time and 42 part-time employees, compared with 4,927 full-time and 85 part-time employees in March 2009, according to regulatory filings. 

In October, Mark Calabria, director of the FHFA, told reporters that he had asked Fannie and Freddie to come up with a plan to boost their return on equity, adding the pair ""can definitely cut expenses,"" without specifying how.

1385,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 06:16PM ET</span>",Online service or property agent? EU court to define Airbnb's status,"By Foo Yun Chee
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - U.S. homesharing site Airbnb will get a better idea of how it should be labeled when Europe's top court rules on Thursday on the tricky question of whether it is an online booking service or a real estate agent subject to onerous rules.
The question arose following a complaint by French tourism association AHTOP, underlining the clash between lightly-regulated online platforms competing with bricks-and-mortar rivals.
The ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) could have far-reaching consequences, particularly as Paris will host the Olympics in 2024 and the IOC has agreed to promote Airbnb for accommodation during the event.
Airbnb has in recent years run up against hoteliers and authorities in cities from New York to Amsterdam, Berlin and Paris, who accused the company of worsening housing shortages and pushing out lower income residents.
Airbnb won backing from a CJEU court adviser in April, who in a non-binding opinion said the company should be treated as a digital service provider and free to operate in the bloc. Judges follow such advice in the majority of cases.
Airbnb has already fended off several challenges by AHTOP in France. It has previously said that the 50-year real estate law does not apply to an internet platform, and that it is working with governments to help diversify tourism and protect housing."

The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 indexes hit intraday highs before the gains faded.
The Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 Indexes rose about 0.05% each. The Russell rose 0.25%. The trio finished with their sixth-straight gains, all records, with the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 Indexes rising less than 0.1% each.
But the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials closed with small losses after five straight gains. The S&P's loss was 0.04%, or 1.4 points.
The Dow gave up a 56-point gain early in the day to close down about 28 points, or 0.1%. 
The Dow was propped up largely thanks to a bounce-back rally in shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Boeing (NYSE:BA) added 1.1% on the day, which contributed about 25 points to the blue-chip index. The company announced late Monday it was suspending production of its troubled 737 Max airliner until it is recertified by regulators.
Traders and investors were paying attention to the impeachment debate and that may have injected a note of uncertainty into the market. Perhaps as important, the market's momentum has slowed in the last week as the major indexes repeatedly hit new highs.
Weighing on the S&P 500 was FedEx (NYSE:FDX), which fell nearly 10% after earnings disappointed and the package-shipping company cut its guidance for 2020.
At the same time, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares were nearly 2% higher after Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) rated the stock a buy. Analysts said Netflix subscribers aren't cancelling in order to sign on with other streaming services such as Walt Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Disney+.
Better, the shares have recovered all of their 22% decline between the end of July and mid-September because of worries the company couldn't compete against streaming services from  Disney , Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and others.

Interest rates moved modestly higher with the 10-Year Treasury yield rising to 1.919% from Tuesday's 1.889%. Gold and Crude oil  prices were basically flat.
  Foot Locker   (NYSE:FL), seed-company   Corteva   (NYSE:CTVA) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) were among the top S&P 500 stocks on the day.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) said Wednesday they plan to exit the North American car-sharing market, with the joint venture partners halting operations in Montreal, New York, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and Vancouver, as they focus on the European market.
SHARE NOW and its Car2Go unit, a joint venture of the two German automakers, are ending operations on Feb. 29 in the United States and Canada, citing the ""volatile state of the global mobility landscape,"" and the costs of operating in North America.
The company also said it was halting operations in three European cities, Florence, London and Brussels. It said it would focus on ""our remaining European cities in which we, along with our shareholders, believe show the greatest potential for profitable growth and mobility innovation.""
DriveNow, part of the combined firm, started in London in December 2014, but ""had to face the hard reality that we could still not convince enough people to do so,"" the company said in announcing its exit from the UK market.
It is the latest sign of financial struggles in the broader mobility market and a setback to those who view car-sharing as a way to reduce carbon pollution and congestion, because unlike ridesharing services, the vehicles are not on the road between trips.
A 2016 study found that each U.S. Car2Go resulted between seven and 11 fewer privately owned vehicles.
Car2Go had 1 million North American members and 3 million worldwide.
The service allowed consumers to rent vehicles by the minute and park them on city streets or at parking meters without charge. The service faced tough competition from ride-hailing firms such as Uber Technologies Co (N:UBER),  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) and electric scooters.
In October, the companies ended operations in Denver, Austin, Texas; Portland, Oregon; and Calgary, British Columbia; and announced an end to Chicago operations.
In 2018, Daimler bought Europcar's (PA:EUCAR) remaining 25% stake in Car2Go for 70 million euros ($78 million). Last year, BMW and Daimler merged their car-sharing units Car2Go and DriveNow as well as ride-hailing, parking and charging services.

BMW's chief executive, Oliver Zipse, said last month that ""there are potentially 'disrupting' business models that rely on car usage rather than car ownership. But they are focused on very specific areas with high population densities to ensure high utilization rates.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended a five-day winning streak on Wednesday as investors' optimism about global economic growth was countered by a steep drop in FedEx Corp (N:FDX) shares, but the benchmark index managed to hover near all-time highs. 
FedEx shares tumbled 10.0% after the U.S. parcel delivery company cut its fiscal 2020 profit forecast on heavy expenses, slowing global trade and fallout from its breakup with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
The decline in FedEx shares weighed on the blue-chip Dow industrials. Shares of rival package delivery company  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) fell 1.9%. The FedEx and UPS losses sent the Dow Jones Transport Average (DJT) down 0.9%.
But the Nasdaq notched a record closing high for a fifth straight session.
Even with Wednesday's nominal losses on the S&P 500, analysts said market sentiment remained largely upbeat following last week's announcement of an initial U.S.-China trade agreement. Earlier in the session, the S&P 500 hit its fifth consecutive record high.
""Investors have gotten much more comfortable with the path of things that have been dark clouds over the market,"" said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer at Vantagepoint Investment Advisers in Washington. ""This is just somewhat of a pause after having such a strong run.""
The market largely shrugged off the likely impeachment of U.S. President Donald Trump as the House of Representatives geared up for a historic vote later in the day on two charges accusing Trump of abusing his power and obstructing Congress.
Impeachment would have little effect on the factors most influential on U.S. markets, said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private. ""It doesn't change what the Fed does,"" she said. ""It doesn't change what happens from a China perspective.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 27.88 points, or 0.1%, to 28,239.28, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 1.38 points, or 0.04%, to 3,191.14, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 4.38 points, or 0.05%, to 8,827.74.
The small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT) hit its highest level in 14 months and ended 0.25% higher.
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) shares rose 2.1%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500, as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) raised its price target on the stock. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.55-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 166 new highs and 59 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.72 billion shares, compared to the 6.95 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1391,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 03:43PM ET</span>",Major Obstacle in PG&E-Newsom Talks Is Prospect of Takeover,"(Bloomberg) -- A clause that would allow California to take over bankrupt utility giant PG&E Corp. under certain circumstances has emerged as a big sticking point in negotiations between the company and Governor Gavin Newsom.
Newsom wants the power company to include a provision in its reorganization proposal that would allow the state to take control of its assets if it fails to meet performance and safety metrics. Negotiating such a clause has become one of the biggest challenges in talks between the company and the governor’s office, people familiar with the situation said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
Newsom’s support is crucial to PG&E’s efforts to exit the biggest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history by a state-imposed deadline of June 30. The power giant filed for Chapter 11 in January after its power lines were tied to deadly blazes that erupted across Northern California in 2017 and 2018, leading to an estimated $30 billion in liabilities.
Now that PG&E has reached settlements with wildfire victims and their insurers -- two groups at the center of its reorganization -- Newsom’s sign-off becomes the biggest obstacle in the company’s efforts to get a restructuring deal done.
“The governor has been clear about the state’s requirements — a new and totally transformed entity that is accountable and prioritizes safety,” Newsom’s office said in a statement. “Critically important to that is ensuring that the new entity has the flexibility to fund this transformation. These points are not negotiable.”
PG&E didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s shares were up 5% at $11.46 at 3:06 p.m. in New York.
Any reorganization would have to be approved by a state utility commission that the governor appoints. And the company will have to prove to Newsom’s office that it has fully resolved its bankruptcy and past wildfire liabilities by June if it wants to participate in a new fire insurance fund to avoid future catastrophic losses.
Read: PG&E Will Have to Answer to California’s Newsom, Just Not Today
Newsom has also ordered PG&E to replace its entire board and come up with a better financing plan that’s cost-neutral for its customers and isn’t so dependent on expensive short-term bridge financing. The company and the governor’s office are working on those demands, people familiar with the talks said.
Meanwhile, a rival restructuring plan being pitched by PG&E bondholders including Pacific Investment Management Co. and Elliott Management Corp. already includes a clause that would allow for a state takeover. But the option would only kick in if the company is found guilty of willful misconduct related to a future fire -- and only if the blaze burns than 5,000 buildings, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg.
The creditors’ plan hasn’t been approved in bankruptcy court or by the governor’s office and faces its own challenges."

On Friday, the program ""Jornal da Band"" said it had obtained documents saying that Vale's B-5 dam in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais had cracks, and that state prosecutors had asked the firm to hire independent auditors to look into the matter.
The dam is located near the town of Brumadinho, where a Vale tailings dam burst in January, killing hundreds. The mining-dependent region has since been on high alert for any possible deficiencies in the area's hundreds of dams.
In the Tuesday statement, the national mining regulator, known as ANM, said it had visited the dam, and while there were some minor superficial irregularities due to animals and a makeshift ""motocross"" course, it was structurally sound.
The B-5 dam ""does not have any relevant structural anomalies that merit concerns,"" the regulator said.
On Friday, Vale said the cracks were superficial and not indicative of a potential dam failure. It said it had self-reported the cracks to regulators."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Unicorns like Uber (NYSE:UBER),  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Slack may have had disappointing IPOs, but U.S. venture capital firms gave birth to a record number of unicorns in 2019.
So far this year 66 venture capital-backed unicorns were minted in the United States versus 58 in 2018, according to market data firm CB Insights.
""I think there's too much money and multiples have gotten out of whack,"" said Aileen Lee, founding partner at Cowboy Ventures, who in 2013 coined the term ""unicorn"" to describe tech start-ups valued at more than $1 billion. 
In 2013, Lee counted 39 unicorns minted since 2003 in the United States, or about four a year. The surge in the number of new unicorns is mostly due to the record amounts of venture capital being put to work, according to several venture capitalists, plus the desire among companies to stay private longer. Being a ""unicorn"" is a status symbol, and helpful for companies looking to stand out.
When hammering out investment terms, investors and company founders can stretch for a higher on-paper valuation by adjusting the amount of equity being sold or adding other terms, investors said. 
CB Insights Chief Executive Anand Sanwal said he has noticed that many new unicorns are valued at exactly $1 billion. 
“Folks started openly acknowledging that, Hey, if I can get the billion-dollar valuation, it attracts talent, it attracts partners,” Sanwal said. 
Jeremy Liew, a partner in venture capital firm Lightspeed, which was an early investor in  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP), said there are some startups in Lightspeed’s portfolio that have raised funds at exactly $1 billion.
“If the fair market value would have been anywhere between 900 and 999 (million), then the investors and the companies will probably figure out ways to bump that to a billion,” said Liew. 

While unicorn creation in the United States continued to rise, China saw a big dip, according to market data firm Crunchbase. It said 21 unicorns have been christened in China so far in 2019, down from 58 last year.

(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (N:FDX) shares tumbled more than 10% on Wednesday after the company slashed its 2020 profit forecast a second time, as it revamps its business to replace slumping air shipments with lower-profit residential deliveries. 
FedEx stock has shed nearly half of its value since January 2018, when it hit an all-time high of $274.32. The U.S.-China trade war has hit the company, as has its costly and overdue integration of its European TNT Express acquisition and its breakup this summer with customer-turned-rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
At least six analysts cut FedEx's price target, unswayed by executives' assertion that the business had bottomed and would improve substantially before the fiscal year ends in May 2020. 
""After a string of disappointments over the last 13 months, the burden of proof is on management,"" Susquehanna analyst Bascome Majors said in a note.
FedEx shares were the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Transportation index (DJT), which was down 0.9%, and rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) fell 1.8%.
FedEx lowered its fiscal 2020 forecast by roughly 9%, citing costs related to launching seven-day delivery, lost revenue from its split with the world's top online retailer and the ongoing U.S-China trade standoff that has roiled global trade. 
Internal missteps and the worst air cargo slump since the financial crisis slammed second-quarter profits in the Memphis-based company's mainstay Express unit that caters largely to businesses seeking speedy deliveries. 
Executives, who are parking planes and restricting hiring to compensate, said FedEx's troubled TNT Express integration was still two years from completion.
The company's bid to capture surging e-commerce shipments with the addition of year-round Sunday deliveries cost more than expected in the latest quarter. This resulted in a year-over-year drop in FedEx Ground's adjusted operating profit that unit chief Henry Maier dubbed ""horrific"" on a conference call with analysts.
FedEx Ground expects to wring out more residential profit by shifting the delivery of millions of SmartPost packages from U.S. Postal Service mail carriers to its own drivers. The goal is to reduce costs by increasing the number of parcels dropped at every stop, but analysts noted that profits on those packages are razor thin.
Bernstein analyst David Vernon did not rule out further forecast reductions. 

""Things are bad, but it's not clear that the floor is in yet,"" Vernon said.

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler and  Peugeot  maker PSA face the challenge of winning over regulators and delivering on a pledge to slash costs without closing factories after sealing a binding deal to create the world's fourth biggest carmaker.
Both tasks are likely to prove difficult, as two of the industry's oldest dynasties try to combine major European operations under the gaze of politicians and trade unions who have vowed to resist any move to cut jobs. 
Success is vital to help both companies cope with a slowdown in demand and the cost of making cleaner vehicles to meet tougher emissions regulations.
In a sign of the pressures on the wider industry, Sweden's Volvo AB agreed on Wednesday to sell its Japan-based UD Trucks business to Isuzu Motors and share technology to help cut costs.
France's PSA (PA:PEUP) and Italian-American Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) announced a preliminary deal six weeks ago for an all-share merger that would create a company worth about $50 billion and unite brands such as Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Maserati with the likes of Peugeot, Opel and DS. 
The terms were little changed in the binding deal announced on Wednesday, including a target to cut costs by 3.7 billion euros ($4.1 billion) a year without closing factories. 
However, analysts said the effective premium being paid by PSA to achieve the 50-50 split was slightly lower. 
'MASSIVE SAVINGS'
The companies sold a combined 8.7 million vehicles last year, but have potential manufacturing capacity of 14 million vehicles, according to forecasters LMC Automotive. 
They have yet to say precisely how they plan to tackle that potential excess, and which car platforms - or underlying vehicle structures - they will focus on, only detailing that most production would be concentrated on two platforms. 
NordLB analyst Frank Schwope said big challenges lay ahead. 
""The merged group will have to make massive savings and probably also close plants, even if the CEOs' choice of words is different,"" he said, adding large investment would be needed as both PSA and FCA are ""currently lagging far behind the competition in terms of technology and product range.""
In the short term, the combined group will use profits from selling Ram pickup trucks and Jeep SUVs to U.S. drivers to fund the development of cleaner vehicles to sell in Europe and China.
The finance ministers of both France and Italy welcomed the deal, but also said they would closely monitor any impact on jobs in their respective countries. 
FCA said it would meet unions on Friday to discuss the deal. 
PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, who will be CEO of the merged group, said the two companies were already very competitive in terms of labor costs versus turnover. 
The companies expect to make about 40% of savings from product-related expenses, 40% from purchasing and 20% from other areas, such as marketing, IT and logistics, they said in a statement.

SMOOTHING THE BUMPS
PSA and FCA expect the deal to close in the next 12 to 15 months and said they would come up with a name over the coming months. In the meantime, they will have to win over regulators in the United States and Europe. 
""This is obviously a huge consolidation of the sector that will surely require a considerable effort in securing competition (approval) across a variety of jurisdictions and especially the European Union,"" said Jonathan Branton, head of competition at global legal business DWF.
LMC Automotive say PSA and FCA were the third and sixth-largest carmakers in Europe last year by sales volumes, and combined would have just pipped Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to the top spot. 
In a move that could help smooth U.S. approval, China's  Dongfeng Motor Group  (HK:0489) will trim its 12.2% stake in PSA by selling 30.7 million shares to the French firm. 
That stake is worth around 680 million euros and will leave Dongfeng holding around 4.5% of the merged group. 
""We have reviewed this topic extensively with the teams from both sides and we are very comfortable that we have no problem on anti-trust,"" Tavares told a conference call.
At 1530 GMT, PSA shares were up 1.2% at 22.37 euros. FCA's were steady at 13.62 euros. 
FAMILY AFFAIR
The merger brings together the Peugeot family, which built its first vehicle around 130 years ago and still holds a stake in PSA, and Fiat's Agnelli clan, whose scion John Elkann will chair the combined group.
There will be an 11-strong board, with five members nominated by PSA and five by FCA, including labor representatives from both. Tavares, whose initial five-year term as CEO will begin once the deal has closed and gained all approvals, will have the additional seat. 
The companies did not clarify what would happen when Tavares leaves. Two sources close to PSA told Reuters last week that French stakeholders were seeking reassurances they would retain a numerical advantage on the board.

A shock lawsuit by General Motors (N:GM) filed last month against FCA in the United State over alleged union bribing did not affect the merger terms, FCA CEO Mike Manley told reporters, reiterating the claim was ""meritless"".

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",Where's the risk? U.S. fund managers bet on bull run in 2020,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With the UK election results giving some certainty to the Brexit process, a U.S.-China trade deal all but signed and the Federal Reserve signaling that it will stand steady for the foreseeable future, there are three fewer hurdles standing in the way of global equities extending their record run into 2020. 
Yet fund managers say that lingering issues on trade and the U.S. elections in November could still weigh on returns in 2020, leaving long-shunned U.S. value stocks and international equities primed to outperform in the year ahead. 
""You're going into an environment where there's a lot of good news already priced into the market, so if there's any derailing of any positive items, there's not a lot of give,"" said Elliot Savage, portfolio manager of the YCG Enhanced Fund, which is up nearly 40% for the year to date. By focusing on unloved areas of the market such as financials, ""You have a chance to pick up companies with significant pricing power that you can hold for a long time,"" he said. 
A rally in value stocks would be a boon to investors who have waited in vain during this record-setting bull market for more cyclical areas like energy and financials to outperform.
The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) hit another record on Tuesday as investors moved out of the perceived safety of bonds, continuing a rally that has boosted it nearly 28% for the year to date. 
PREPPING FOR A PULL-BACK
The dialing down of risks hanging over the market could lead to it to become overheated, warned Charles Lemonides, portfolio manager of hedge fund ValueWorks LLC. 
""You may get some optimism in the markets where you will see buying that is valuation non-specific and you'll get a momentum trade come back into market,"" he said. 
Lemonides is focusing more closely on valuations and has been buying energy names like Tidewater Inc (N:TDW) and biotechs like  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD). 
""Biotechs across the board are so attractively priced given their fundamentals,"" he said. 
At the same time, the increasing focus on Washington during a presidential election year could become a drain on investor sentiment, said Lemonides. 
""Presidential elections freeze investors on both sides of the political spectrum,"" he said. ""The fundamental conditions of the market are really good but there will be a headwind from the election."" 
A decline in the U.S. equity market could offer an opportunity to add to small caps, which have underperformed the broader market, said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager of the Federated Global Allocation Fund. 
""The market has run up so quickly that we may get a sharp pullback purely on technical reasons, but we still think that there's going to be a catch-up trade in areas that haven't had the same run,"" he said. 
LOOKING AT EUROPE 
The apparent resolution of Brexit will likely prompt more investor interest in European stocks, while trade issues will continue to weigh on investor sentiment for China, said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. 
""The investors we spoke with viewed the UK election as a major step toward resolution of Brexit, but didn’t see the developments in the U.S.-China trade war as having the same significance,"" she said. 
The Conservative majority in Parliament is widely expected to pass the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement before the current deadline of Jan. 31. At the same time, the ""Phase one"" pact between the United States and China focuses on reducing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for increased Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural, manufactured and energy products over the next two years. 
""Although we're seeing tamed-back rhetoric, we believe that we're still far away from an ultimate trade deal that will put this behind us. Maybe we've just tackled the easy-to-solve problems,"" said Brian Kersmanc, deputy portfolio manager for GQG Partners' International Equity strategy. 
Kersmanc has been moving more of his portfolio into European stocks such as  London Stock Exchange  Group PLC (L:LSE) and French aerospace company  Safran  SA (PA:SAF). He is also looking into European value sectors such as industrial stocks and energy, both of which have been weighed down by concerns about the strength of the European economy. 
""There's some really interesting opportunities in companies that no one wanted to touch,"" he said. ""Now that the market sees a Brexit resolution happening, you're going to see stocks coming off a severe discount.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors started closing the books on 2019 by withdrawing more than $10.9 billion from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold domestic stocks last week, the largest pullback since early October, according to Investment Company Institute data released on Wednesday.
The declines marked the 10th out of the last 12 weeks that investors have retreated from the U.S. stock market despite the benchmark S&P 500 touching a series of record highs.
The index is up more than 27% for the year to date, notching its best performance since the slightly more than 29% annual gain in 2013, thanks in part to the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates low.
Investors pulled back from foreign stocks as well, withdrawing nearly $1.3 billion from the category. Instead, they continued to seek the perceived safety of bonds, which have rallied in anticipation that the Fed will not raise rates unless the central bank sees signs of persistent inflation.
Bond funds took in nearly $10.2 billion in inflows, pushing the year to date gain for the category to nearly $333.4 billion."

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 12:55PM ET</span>",French designs on dominance of Peugeot-Fiat rest on Tavares,"By Gilles Guillaume and Giulio Piovaccari
PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Billed as a merger of equals, PSA's $50 billion tie-up with  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) gives the  Peugeot  owner one potentially big advantage, its own boss will be firmly behind the new wheel.
But the position of Portuguese car fanatic Carlos Tavares, who knocked Peugeot into shape and steered PSA's (PA:PEUP) 2017 swoop on Germany's Opel, also raises uncomfortable questions for the French carmaker.
The balance of power within the combined group will be politically sensitive in France and Italy as its new management seeks out annual savings of 3.7 billion euros ($4 billion).
Although the carmakers have pledged not to close any factories, Rome and Paris will both try to protect jobs and across their domestic manufacturing supply base.
To compete globally, the merged companies would do better to invest outside their slow-growing, high cost domestic markets.
Another Franco-Italian deal touted as a merger of equals, the 54 billion euro ($59.5 billion) all-share deal between Ray-Ban owner Luxottica and lens manufacturer Essilor in 2017 was plagued by a ferocious governance battle, something the architects of PSA's deal with FCA (MI:FCHA) will seek to avoid.
But with Tavares occupying the eleventh seat in a board made up of five members named by FCA and another five by PSA, some in the French camp see the balance of power on the Peugeot side.
""If there's one key asset which PSA benefits from, it's Carlos Tavares. You can't just boil a company down to one manager, but for us it was a very important element,"" a source at state investment bank BPI, which holds France's stake, said.
""He represents the interests of PSA, and tomorrow will represent those of the combined group as a whole,"" added the source at BPI, which will own around 6% of the combined group.
PSA and FCA did not clarify what would happen to the board seat if and when Tavares left.
""All decisions regarding the CEO will be taken by the board of the 'newco',"" Tavares told reporters, saying the matter was premature and adding that there was nothing in deal laying out what would happen beyond his five year mandate.
A source close to FCA played down the implications of the board arrangements, however, saying Exor, the holding company behind Italy's Agnelli clan and its scion John Elkann, who will chair the combined group, were not bothered by nationality.
PSA PREMIUM
The financial equation in PSA and FCA's 50-50 share merger makes the power balance less than clear-cut.
FCA is due to pay out a cash dividend of 5.5 billion euros to its shareholders before the deal takes place.
When stripping that out, and taking the firm's share price right before the outline of the deal was announced in October, the Jeep maker was worth around 14 billion euros.
That compares to a stock market value of just over 20 billion euro for PSA, when accounting for the majority stake in Faurecia it plans to spin out to its own shareholders prior to the deal, worth 3.2 billion euros at the time.
The effective premium being paid by PSA has since narrowed, but still stands at over a billion euros.
The two companies said that FCA's planned spin-off of its robotics unit Comau, worth 250 million euros, would now take place after the merger rather than before, which would benefit shareholders on both sides.
A source close to the transaction said this was partly being done to allow Comau's business time to recover but will also let PSA shareholders enjoy the spoils."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG's Mercedes-Benz USA (DE:DAIGn) has agreed to a $20 million civil penalty over its handling of U.S. vehicle recalls after a year-long U.S. government investigation into 1.4 million recalled vehicles.
Under the terms of the settlement, the German automaker will pay $13 million and faces another $7 million fine if it does not comply with the agreement. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Daimler failed to notify owners in a timely fashion in some recalls, did not submit all reports and did not launch at least two recalls in a timely fashion.
Mercedes-Benz USA (MBUSA) said in a statement ""we believe that we did not deliberately do anything wrong, but unfortunately we missed some deadlines in informing the agency of the measures we had taken in fulfilling their requirements."" It added the company ""agreed to resolve this matter in an effort to answer NHTSA’s questions and move forward.""
The automaker will meet with NHTSA on a quarterly basis to discuss its recall performance for at least a year. The automaker is ""currently developing more robust procedures with regard to reporting noncompliance concerns.""
NHTSA said it had taken into account ""the substantial financial investment that MBUSA has made in the development and rollout of its automated recall management tool, as well as the hiring of additional personnel and ongoing trainings.""
NHTSA had also raised concerns about ""recurring and unannounced failures"" in the automaker's data system in supplying information to the agency's Vehicle Identification Number lookup tool that allows owners to check to see if their vehicle has been recalled.
""The agency’s reporting requirements help ensure that consumers are protected and given important information about how to get recalls repaired,” said NHTSA Acting Administrator James Owens in a statement. ""We expect manufacturers to follow their legal obligations to the agency and to consumers in carrying out safety recalls.""

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 11:26AM ET</span>",Canada's SNC-Lavalin unit to plead guilty to fraud charge in Libya case: La Presse,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - An SNC-Lavalin Group (TO:SNC) division will plead guilty to a fraud charge related to projects in Libya after an agreement with prosecutors, La Presse reported on Wednesday, in a case that engulfed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government in crisis this year.
The Montreal-based construction and engineering company was accused of bribing Libyan officials to get contracts between 2001 and 2011. Shares in SNC were halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange early on Wednesday.
On Sunday, a Quebec jury found a former top SNC-Lavalin executive guilty of fraud and corruption charges related to the Libya case. Government prosecutors had suggested Sami Bebawi, the former head of SNC's international construction arm, was a key figure in the bribery scheme.
Quebec newspaper La Presse said on Wednesday that the company's SNC-Lavalin Construction unit will plead guilty in connection with the fraud charges.
The case will be halted against SNC-Lavalin itself, with Canadian prosecutors recommending a C$280-million fine and a three year probation, the newspaper said. 
A court conviction would have barred SNC-Lavalin from bidding on government contracts for 10 years, threatening job losses in Canada. The company employs around 9,000 people in Canada and tens of thousands abroad. 
Earlier this year, Trudeau’s government faced allegations that top officials pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to direct prosecutors to strike a deal rather than go ahead with a trial.
Trudeau was re-elected with a minority government in October.

SNC had asked for a deferred prosecution agreement on the grounds it had removed the executives who were in charge at the time and overhauled its ethics and compliance systems.

1408,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 09:43AM ET</span>","U.S. Stocks Shrug Off Impeachment, Push Higher: Markets Wrap","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. equities and European stocks gained on Wednesday as investors digested a flurry of corporate news amid a lull in trade-war headlines. Treasuries slipped and the British pound weakened.
The S&P 500 Index rose early Wednesday, a day after inching up to another record amid positive U.S. factory and housing data.   General Mills   Inc (NYSE:GIS). jumped after posting profit that topped estimates, while FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). slid following a cut to its forecast. With few big economic headlines imminent, and much of the U.S. focused on the impeachment vote, investors may take a wait-and-see stance as the holidays near.
“The most interesting development on Wednesday will likely be how little impeachment matters for the Treasury market, and cross-asset valuations writ large,” Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note, adding that a Senate conviction is unlikely. “The trial will occur during Q1 of next year, but is more likely to distract from underlying economics and momentum than anything else.”
With global stocks close to all-time highs and the U.S.-China trade accord announced Friday yet to be signed, traders are finding few reasons to bid prices higher. The outlook for America’s monetary policy remains steady -- two Federal Reserve policy makers reiterated that interest rates are on hold -- yet the miserable results from FedEx were a reminder of the headwinds to growth.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index moved higher after struggling for traction as national benchmarks traded mixed, with Germany’s gauge underperforming even as data showed business expectations improved for a third month.
PSA Group rose and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) was steady as they agreed to combine in a deal to create the world’s fourth-biggest auto manufacturer. Bang & Olufsen (LON:0MRM) plunged after the luxury TV and stereo maker issued its fourth profit warning in a year.

Want something to moan about now that European stocks have finally hit record highs? Trading volumes might be a good place to look. In the biggest rally for European equities since the aftermath of the financial crisis, the cash value traded on the Stoxx 600 index is down about 13% compared to last year, and figures from the region’s biggest exchanges aren’t encouraging either.
Cash equity volume at the London Stock Exchange is down 19% for the first 11 months of 2019 year-on-year, while turnover on Deutsche Boerse’s Xetra is 15% below 2018 levels. To be fair, last year saw the strongest turnover in a decade, but for the wrong reasons: stocks tumbled in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Big volumes on the downside, light volumes in the rally: this is not a good sign, although not entirely a surprise given the lack of investment inflows we’ve flagged here a few times. Usually a market trading at elevated levels near or above record highs, without the underlying confidence reflected in high trading volume, might be a red flag.
“The healthy market is when it’s rising with large volumes,” says Kepler Cheuvreux Global Head of Execution Services Patricia Shin. When the average investor holding an exchange-traded fund dumps its position without fundamental buyers in place, the market will drop without volume, she says.
It’s giving hedge funds and big banks a hard time. “Low volume and low volatility is killing them,” Shin says, talking about hedge funds. As for big banks, they may struggle to make money out of their brokerage business as a consequence, hence more and more lenders are now investing in wealth management, which provides steadier flows, Shin says.
One reason could lie with a change in the way managers are investing. An increasing number of them turn to more static strategies to gain exposure to stocks, with a minimal churn during market swings, even when they have an active approach. “It feels less and less like stock picking,” Shin says.
The lack of volatility this year may also be another reason, according to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Benjamin Goy. “Equity volatility, the main driver of cash equity trading volumes, remained suppressed this year with the exception of short-term volatility spikes, as central bank policies remain accommodative,” Goy says.
Indeed, the gauge that measures the swings of the Euro Stoxx 50 (VStoxx) is trading near historic lows, but more importantly, it hasn’t experienced significant spikes this year.
Broadly speaking, we may not go back to a growing volume trend, because the changes are structural, says Alain Bokobza, Societe Generale’s head of global asset allocation. He sees several factors behind these structural changes, starting with the decreasing number of listed companies worldwide. Buybacks are also playing an important role in the de-equitization process.
And that’s not all. Investors’ habits are changing, Bokobza says, highlighting the growth of passive strategies through ETFs, while asset managers have also switched a significant part of their portfolios to unlisted assets, as they have become more liquid."

7:45 AM ET: FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock was down 7.6% after publishing a 40% drop in profit in its fiscal second quarter, due in part to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) pivoting from customer to rival in the delivery space. Revenue fell 3% to $17.3 billion, also short of consensus forecasts.

FedEx (NYSE:FDX) also cut its full-year earnings per share forecast by nearly 10% to a range around $10.88 a share.
08:53 AM:   Devon Energy   (NYSE:DVN) stock rose 1.3% after the shale oil and gas producer said it will sell its Barnett shale operations for $770 million. The company will funnel all of the proceeds and more into raising the ceiling of its share buyback program by $1 billion to $6 billion. So far, under the currently authorized program, it has bought back $4.8 billion.
The deal completes the disposal of Devon's gas assets and its refocusing as an oil producer.
As of the third quarter, Devon was producing just under 600 million cubic feet of gas a day from the Barnett assets.

08:43 AM: Cigna (NYSE:CI) stock is in the spotlight after the Financial Times reported it has agreed to sell its life and disability insurance business to New York Life for $6.3 billion.

The unit in question accounts for just over 10% of Cigna’s revenue.
The deal would cut Cigna’s debt pile, which had risen to $39 billion after the acquisition of Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX). The FT said that would cut its debt servicing costs by $200 million a year.
08:25 AM: Pacific Gas & Electric (NYSE:PCG) stock rose 11.6% after a California court approved its draft $13.5 billion settlement with victims of wildfires caused by its faulty equipment in 2017 and 2018. The court also approved an $11 billion settlement with insurers who picked up the tab for the ensuing claims.
The company’s way out from chapter 11 bankruptcy is still littered with obstacles, however. California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the company’s plan doesn’t meet the state’s requirements for a new scheme that would partially protect utilities against future wildfire damage if they operate safely.
A rival plan to exit bankruptcy drafted by bondholders has also met with rejection by the state.

8:11 AM ET: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) inched up 0.1% after Bloomberg reported that it is considering cutting prices for its Chinese-made cars by 20% next year, in part by sourcing more parts locally so as to avoid import tariffs.

07:57 AM ET:   General Mills   (NYSE:GIS) stock was up 2.5% after the maker of Cheerios reported a 7% rise in operating profit in constant currencies.
Net earnings per share rose more sharply, reflecting high restructuring costs a year earlier. Organic net sales rose only 1%, however, leaving revenue nearly flat at $4.4 billion.
The company reaffirmed its guidance for the full fiscal 2020 year.

7:50 AM Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) ADRs were down 0.9% after the company agreed merger terms with France’s    Peugeot    (PA:PEUP). Under the agreed deal, FCA shareholders will still get their 5.5 billion euro ($6.1 billion) special dividend before completion.

In addition, the company will cancel all double voting rights currently held by strategic shareholders, a move which will limit the French government’s influence. Strategic shareholders in the combined group will receive new double voting rights after three years."
1412,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 08:43AM ET</span>","Aramco shares slip on day of MSCI, Tadawul inclusion","By Davide Barbuscia and Tom Arnold
DUBAI (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) shares fell almost 3% on Wednesday as investors pocketed profits on the day it was included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MSCIEF) and the Saudi Tadawul index (TASI).
State-owned Aramco listed on the Saudi exchange last week having raised $25.6 billion in the largest initial public offering (IPO) on record.
The oil giant's shares, which were originally priced at 32 riyals, slipped from Tuesday's close to open at 37.5 riyals ($10.00). After shedding further value during the day, they eventually closed 2.8% lower at 36.7 riyals.
Inclusion in a benchmark index attracts inflows from passive investors who track those indexes but can lead to some initial profit taking, especially if funds or retail investors bought in advance of a company being added.
""It's common after the addition to the MSCI, lots of profit taking,"" said a Saudi banker.
Index compiler MSCI said last week Saudi Aramco would have an estimated weight of 0.16% in its emerging market index and an estimated weight of 6.03% in the MSCI Saudi Arabia Index.
On the Tadawul all-share index it had a 12% weighting, the largest after Al Rajhi Bank (SE:1120) at almost 14%, Refintiv data showed. A cap of 15% limits the risk from a single security representing a large percentage of the index, as well as limiting correlation to the oil price.
The Saudi index, down 0.25% in early trade, closed up 0.7%.
Dubai-based Arqaam Capital calculated Aramco's inclusion in the MSCI index would attract about $710 million in passive inflows to the company's shares, with a further $400 million likely when Aramco joins the global FTSE benchmark on Thursday.
Despite its size, Aramco's weighting in MSCI's emerging markets index is less than companies such as  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) at 5.84% and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TW:2330) at 4.25%, according to an MSCI report dated the end of November.
""Saudi Aramco’s listing and its inclusion in global indices reflects the significant reform progress that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia continues to implement,"" said Edward Evans, portfolio manager, emerging markets equity at Ashmore Group, an emerging markets investment firm.
MOMENTUM
Aramco's IPO is the centerpiece of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's vision for diversifying the kingdom away from its oil dependency by using the $25.6 billion raised to develop other industries.
Despite some scepticism about the firm's worth, it hit the $2 trillion market valuation long-sought by the prince on its second day of trading, only losing momentum on Tuesday.
Analysts at Jefferies this week initiated coverage of the stock with an ""underperform"" rating, estimating Aramco's value at $1.6 trillion and citing governance concerns due to the close relationship between the firm and the Saudi government.
But Ashmore's Evans said Aramco can attract a wider institutional investor base going forward as it builds a track record with investors and weathers the pressure of equity markets.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 08:07AM ET</span>",Special Report: FDA targets e-cigs that hook teens but don't help smokers quit,"By Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - E-cigarette makers face an existential threat. By May, they must submit applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proving that their products provide a net benefit to public health. If a company fails to make its case, the FDA has the power to order its products off the market.
The agency will judge that benefit with a two-part test: Are e-cigarettes effective in getting smokers to quit? And, if so, does that benefit outweigh the health damage to new e-cigarette users - including teenagers - who never smoked in the first place?
That’s a particularly high hurdle for the largest e-cigarette maker, Juul Labs Inc, according to a Reuters analysis of the latest available data on trends in cigarette and e-cigarette use from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The data show that e-cigarettes are having little impact in reducing U.S. cigarette smoking, while growth in vaping since 2015 has come entirely from users under 25 years old, including teenagers. Those trends present a special problem for Juul because of its dominance of the U.S. market and its enormous popularity among teenagers, according to more than a half dozen tobacco researchers and medical experts who assessed the data at Reuters' request.
""I don't see it as a surmountable hurdle,"" Suzanne Colby, a tobacco researcher at Brown University, said of the FDA standard for public health benefits. ""The data look like their product differentially attracts youth instead of adults, in such great numbers.""
Between 2017 and 2018 - the period when Juul rapidly grew to become the U.S. market leader - e-cigarette use among U.S. adults grew from 2.8% of the population to 3.2%, according to the CDC. But rates of cigarette smoking among adults barely budged, dropping from 14% to 13.7% - not enough to be statistically significant, according to the CDC. (For a graphic showing vaping trends for various age groups, see: https://graphics.reuters.com/JUUL-ECIGARETTES-FDA/0100B4QQ2FX/JUUL-ECIGARETTES-FDA1.jpg )
Use of e-cigarettes by high-school students, by contrast, shot up by 78% over the same period – from 11.7% to 20.8% of students, data from the CDC and the FDA show. Juul is by far the most popular e-cigarette among teens, with more than half of high school and middle school students naming it as their favorite brand in surveys by the CDC and the FDA.
Moreover, the biggest growth in adult e-cigarette use came among the youngest age cohort of adults, people aged 18 to 24. E-cigarette use among young adults is nearly four times more common than among those aged 45 to 64, the CDC numbers show.
Another dynamic that undermines the public-health case for e-cigarettes is the large proportion of ""dual users."" The most recent federal data show that 41% of adult e-cigarette users continue to also smoke cigarettes. 
Some studies show dual use could be more harmful than smoking alone. A study last December found people who used both products tested higher than cigarette smokers for a range of volatile organic compounds and other toxins associated with tobacco-related disease. A separate study last year of heart disease risk among e-cigarette users found that dual use was ""more dangerous than using either product alone.""
For the industry as a whole, the usage data cast serious doubts on whether e-cigarettes are providing a clear benefit among adult smokers, said Brian King, a deputy director at the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health.
""When it comes to net public health impact, you have to consider both ends of the scale,"" King said. ""Right now it does appear the youth initiation is outweighing the adult use.""
Juul declined a request for an interview with executives including CEO K.C. Crosthwaite, a veteran of Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc who took the helm in September, on how it plans to pass the FDA's regulatory test. As pressure on the company has mounted, Crosthwaite has made the FDA application process a central goal, laying off 650 employees, including many in marketing, last month in an effort to restructure the company to focus on regulatory approval.
In written responses to questions from Reuters, Juul said it believes its products ""already are playing a critical role in transitioning adult smokers from combustible cigarettes and have the potential to convert tens of millions of smokers in the U.S."" The company cited studies it has commissioned showing that between 30% to 50% of adult smokers who use Juul ""switch completely from smoking cigarettes within six months.""
Juul has said its customers are “the world’s 1 billion smokers,” but the company did not directly address questions about the disparity in youth and adult uptake in the United States. Juul acknowledged it must address any potential impact on nonsmokers who start using e-cigarettes. It said it is ""committed to working cooperatively with regulators, public health officials and other stakeholders to combat underage use and convert adult smokers.""
In October, Crosthwaite brought on another Altria executive, Joe Murillo, who helped navigate a successful FDA application for IQOS, a Phillip Morris International Inc product that heats up but doesn't burn packages of ground-up tobacco. Altria has an agreement with Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) to market IQOS in the United States. The IQOS device is one of only two tobacco products that have successfully made it through the FDA process.
Juul’s competitors in the U.S. market face the same regulatory challenge. One rival, Japan Tobacco International, says it is confident in the FDA application it filed in August for its Logic products because it contains company data showing the brand - unlike Juul - is used overwhelmingly by older adults.
Anthony Hemsley, an executive for Japan Tobacco International's U.S. division, acknowledged the population-wide trends in e-cigarette and cigarette use. But he pointed out that the FDA's decision on net public health benefit will be made on a product-by-product basis - not across the entire industry. He added that Juul has ""a significant challenge ahead of them, in overcoming the concerns that exist out there."" 
The FDA declined requests for an interview with Mitch Zeller, who heads tobacco regulation at the agency, about its oversight of e-cigarettes. In written answers to questions, the agency did not directly address the population-level data on smoking and vaping trends but said it is “tasked with threading a public health needle” in crafting regulations on e-cigarette firms.
A Reuters investigation in November detailed how Juul's developers used tobacco industry research and patents to formulate its smooth but potent ""nicotine salts"" blend of liquid nicotine, a key factor in its popularity among teenagers. The report showed company leaders were aware of the product's popularity among teenagers soon after its 2015 launch, contradicting statements that Juul was caught off guard by teenage use last year.
Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told Reuters that he agreed with public health advocates and tobacco researchers that whatever benefits Juul may be having for cigarette smokers are offset by attracting children who otherwise wouldn't have tried other tobacco products. Before Gottlieb left the department in April, he and his staff explored the option of halting sales of Juul and similar high-nicotine devices if their popularity continued rising among teens.
""We could take these products off the market tomorrow,” he said. “We don't need the applications."" 
(For a graphic tracking the rise of vaping amid regulatory delays, see: https://graphics.reuters.com/JUUL-ECIGARETTES-FDA/0100B4QR2G3/JUUL-ECIGARETTES-FDA2.jpg) 
Juul and the FDA did not respond to questions on Gottlieb’s assertion that the agency should immediately remove Juul and similar products from the market.  
MOUNTING PRESSURE ON THE FDA
E-cigarettes have been available in the United States since at least 2007, but the FDA did not formally get authority over the industry until nine years later, in 2016.
The agency initially tried to regulate e-cigarettes as a drug, which would have carried more stringent requirements for e-cigarette firms, such as extensive clinical trials or animal testing. E-cigarette makers sued the FDA and won, leaving the agency to regulate the devices as tobacco products.
FDA officials started crafting a rule to regulate e-cigarettes in 2011, but the industry pushed back and successfully delayed the rule until May 2016, in the final months of the administration of President Barack Obama. During that time, Juul and dozens of competitors introduced products that were grandfathered into the market because they were already being sold before the regulation took effect.
The rule extended certain cigarette restrictions to e-cigarettes, like requiring health warning labels, setting a minimum sales age of 18 and prohibitions on free samples.
A key part of the new rule also required e-cigarette makers to submit applications to the agency by August 2018 - demonstrating why their products provide a net benefit to public health - along with studies and data on potential toxins in the products.
When Gottlieb was appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the agency in 2017, one of his first moves was to delay that deadline by four years, a decision public health advocates criticized. Just months later, school administrators, parents and politicians raised alarms about the rapid rise of vaping among high schoolers, who were particularly transfixed with the Juul device.
Some public health advocates feared the new administration’s commitment to the Obama-era regulations after an initial three-month delay, as the FDA faced litigation from the industry. Gottlieb declined to comment  on whether the some in the administration wanted to kill the regulations but said his effort to push them forward was “not an easy process.” He said he delayed the deadline because the previous administration had not drafted guidelines that companies could follow for the application process, leaving the agency open to a legal challenge from the regulated industries.
""They would have sued me, and I would have lost,"" he said.
But today’s FDA could – and should – pull Juul and other products from the market, Gottlieb said.
""I thought that's where the agency would land,"" he said.
In March, just before he left the agency, Gottlieb said publicly that the FDA was considering prohibiting sales of cartridge-based e-cigarettes like Juul from the market if teen usage rates went up for a second year in a row. Federal youth tobacco survey data first released in September showed that teenage usage did in fact keep rising, with the percentage of teenagers reporting they used e-cigarettes in the last 30 days growing from nearly 21% to more than 27%.
In a statement, the FDA said it has sent more than 1,100 warning letters to retailers selling to minors; issued warning letters to companies marketing teen-friendly e-cigarette products, such as those with sweet flavors; and launched advertising campaigns aimed at e-cigarette prevention in schools.

""Taken together, all of these efforts have had a wide-ranging impact on the manufacturing, marketing and selling"" of e-cigarettes, the agency said. ""FDA's work is constant in its effort to keep these products out of the hands of kids.""

Forteinvest is a controlling shareholder in Russian oil refineries Orsknefteorgsintez and Afipsky, and is part of a wider Safmar group of companies, the umbrella Gutseriyev's family business.
Three sources working at Forteinvest confirmed the searches to Reuters but could not say who the people were. One of the sources said that several people accompanied by a number of masked people were taking out documents in the Forteinvest office in central Moscow.
""Staff was told they may leave for home, except for bosses,"" the first source said.
Russian business daily newspapers Kommersant and Vedomosti, citing their sources, said that the searches were jointly conducted by the interior ministry and the Federal Security Service.
Both newspapers said that searches were also conducted in other companies linked to Mikhail Gutseriyev.
The Russian Investigative Committee and the Federal Security Service did not immediately reply to Reuters' requests for comments. A spokesman for the Russian interior ministry said he did not have immediate information about any searches.
In a statement on its web-site, Safmar said that the media reports did not ""correspond with reality"", adding that ""law enforcement bodies do not have any claims to the companies of the group"".
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call on Wednesday the Kremlin was unaware of the searches.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks remained just off record highs on Wednesday after climbing for five straight sessions, while Britain's pound nursed heavy losses as Brexit uncertainty returned.
European equities edged higher (STOXX) after falling the day before as Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson took a harder line on Brexit. 
Earlier, Asian shares drifted down. Japan's Nikkei (N225) dipped 0.6% and China's stocks slipped (CSI300) even after Beijing trimmed another short-term interest rate.
U.S. equity futures (ESc1) (1YMc1) were up and MSCI's world stock index (MIWD00000PUS) stood just off record highs. It has rallied almost 23% this year, set for its best year in a decade and the fourth-best year ever. 
A run of better data recently has helped calm fears of a recession while phase one of a Sino-U.S. deal on trade appears to have eased some of the uncertainty on the global outlook.
German business morale rose more than expected in December to a six-month high, the Ifo survey showed on Wednesday, suggesting that Europe's largest economy picked up steam in the fourth quarter.
""I expect markets to end the year quietly but mildly positively, especially if the PBoC does nibble down the lending interest rate later this week,"" said Chris Bailey European strategist at Raymond James, referring to China's central bank.
""Bigger challenges naturally await for next year ... but I think traders and investors will be happier to grapple with these actually in 2020.""
NOT SO FAST 
But it might be too soon to declare an all-clear on the political front. The Democratic-led House of Representatives in the United States is expected to vote on Wednesday for two articles of impeachment that charge President Donald Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Few expect the Republican-dominated Senate to convict Trump and force him from office, but the impeachment process could focus attention on next year's U.S. election risks.
In Britain, the Prime Minister Johnson says he will use the prospect of a Brexit cliff-edge at the end of 2020 to demand the EU give him a comprehensive free trade deal in less than 11 months.

Analysts said Thursday's central bank meetings in Britain, Japan, Sweden and Norway could bring some volatility.

(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (N:AIG) on Thursday named Peter Zaffino, the executive overseeing a turnaround effort of the company's general insurance unit, as the company's president.
Zaffino, AIG's global chief operating officer and chief of its general insurance business, will continue to serve in those roles when he becomes president on Jan. 1, 2020, AIG said.
He replaces AIG Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault as president.
Zaffino joined AIG as COO in 2017 from insurance broker March LLC (N:MMC) where he was CEO. Duperreault, who took helm of AIG that same year, handpicked Zaffino to work alongside him in an effort to turn the company around.
A key focus was transforming AIG's general insurance business where Duperreault and Zaffino set about overhauling AIG's underwriting culture after years spent chasing revenue growth without appropriately weighing risks.
In May, AIG's general insurance business posted its first underwriting profit since the global financial crisis.
""Today's announcement recognizes the value that Peter has brought to AIG over the last couple of years,"" Dupperault said in a statement.
Zaffino's roles include overseeing a company-wide initiative that AIG set in motion this year to improve its technology and processes."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fruit smoothies may become the new martini for Wall Street holiday parties.
Banking and trading firm BTIG LLC, for example, cut alcohol from its annual employee celebration on Dec. 12 at its New York offices. Instead, guests did yoga and bootcamp-style workouts, played ping-pong, and downed smoothies, juices and fruit-infused water.
“I’m sore, just in a different way,” joked a happy BTIG employee the morning after donning Lululemon fitness gear to compete with colleagues. “My head doesn’t hurt; my body hurts.” 
BTIG is an outlier on Wall Street, but interviews with some employees, events staff and those who work in the wellness industry suggest more companies are moving their holiday parties and other events away from booze-centric bacchanals.
Younger Wall Street employees are increasingly health conscious, and companies are attuned to the liability of alcohol-laden corporate events in the #MeToo era. 
“You can’t go wrong with what we did,” said the BTIG employee. 
The Pierre, a luxury hotel near Central Park, featured specialty ""mocktails"" at holiday parties for approximately half a dozen financial firms this year, part of broader increase in demand for such non-alcoholic cocktails, according to director of catering Bill Spinner.
Barry’s Bootcamp, a fitness club chain popular with Wall Street, has seen an increase in bookings by financial firms for employee and client workouts this holiday season, according to director of community marketing Alisa Holzer.
The emerging trend on Wall Street echoes similar events in the technology industry, with which it increasingly competes with for talent.
Seedlip, which makes non-alcoholic spirits, recently hosted a 1,200-person Google (O:GOOGL) holiday party at Rolling Greens Nursery in Los Angeles, serving approximately 700 “Holiday CosNOs” and other alcohol-free cocktails, said spokeswoman Lorena Tapiero. Seedlip beverages were also served at a recent Netflix (O:NFLX) employee gathering in LA, she said. Google and Netflix did not respond to emails seeking comment. 
Even as some employees embraced workouts and mocktails, alcohol flowed across much of Wall Street this holiday season. The bars were stocked and open at New York soirees organized by BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), D.E. Shaw & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Evercore Inc (N:EVR),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA), and  Credit Suisse  Group (S:CSGN), according to attendees and social media posts. The parties featured such amusements as a limbo contest and professional contortionists. The firms declined to comment or did not respond to requests.

An employee who attended one of the parties described it as “merry and lit.”

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>","U.S. regulator to propose new, streamlined cross-border swap rules: officials","By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. regulator on Wednesday will propose relaxing rules on U.S. firms' overseas derivatives dealing, replacing a stricter Obama-era proposal that critics said would have curtailed U.S. companies' foreign businesses, officials told Reuters.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposal should lighten the load for U.S. swaps trading firms, marking another win for the industry under the Trump administration which has been trimming rules introduced following the 2007-2009 financial crisis that it says are too draconian.
Investors use swaps, a type of derivative, to hedge exposure to potential price movements in assets such as currencies and interest rates.
The 2010 Dodd Frank Act introduced strict new swap dealing rules, but nearly 10 years later the CFTC has yet to formalize how those rules apply when U.S. companies deal swaps overseas. U.S. companies have had to rely on a patchwork of CFTC guidance and waivers on how to treat such trades.
In October 2016, then-CFTC Chair Tim Massad proposed sweeping new rules which would have subjected a large swath of foreign swap dealing to CFTC rules. He was worried risky foreign dealing by U.S. dealers could hurt U.S. markets.
But critics said that proposal was too aggressive, affecting deals with little U.S. risk and potentially hampering liquidity in the global swaps market. That rule fell by the wayside after the Trump administration took office.
On Wednesday, the CFTC will propose a slimmed down rule for establishing whether overseas subsidiaries of U.S. firms should be subject to CFTC rules. It will effectively replace Massad's proposal, CFTC officials told Reuters.
The new rules would exempt foreign subsidiaries of U.S. bank holding companies because they are already subject to Federal Reserve scrutiny. They would also exempt U.S. subsidiaries dealing in countries that the CFTC deems to have equally stringent regulations.
The CFTC estimates that less than 10% of global swaps trading takes place outside equivalent jurisdictions.
For foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies, such as insurers or brokers, operating outside those exemptions, the proposal sets relatively high asset and capital-based thresholds for testing whether they should comply with CFTC rules.
""We must not regulate swaps activities in far flung lands simply to prevent every risk that might have a nexus to the United States,"" according to CFTC Chair Heath Tarbert's prepared remarks seen by Reuters.
""That would be a markedly poor use of American taxpayers' dollars."""

The joint venture's services will include brokerage, investment advisory, underwriting and sponsorship, the U.S. bank announced in a press release on Wednesday.
China has overhauled regulations to grant foreign firms greater access to its financial sector that is worth trillion of dollars, including to banks, fund management, brokerages and insurance businesses in recent years.
Swiss lender UBS (S:UBSG) became the first to hold a majority stake in a China securities business under the new rules last year. Japanese brokerage Nomura Holdings (T:8604) got its green light last month.
Separately, JPMorgan said in August it had won an auction to purchase the shares needed for a majority equity stake in its Chinese asset management joint venture, pending regulatory approval.
""We will continue to invest in and fully support our business in the country, which has become a critical market for many of our domestic and global clients,"" said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of  JP Morgan Chase , said in the press release on Wednesday.

1423,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 05:03AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Peugeot, Fiat Inch up After Confirming Merger Terms","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com --  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and   Fiat   Chrysler (MI:FCHA) both rose in early trade Wednesday after confirming their agreement to merge in a deal that will create the world’s fourth-biggest automaker.
The all-share deal remains much as it was at the time of its first announcement at the end of October, suggesting that the French group wasn’t too bothered by perceptions that FCA’s shareholders got the better of the initial valuations. FCA will pay its shareholders a special dividend of 5.5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) before getting fully half of the merged entity.
Peugeot’s stock is still down some 10% from immediately before the announcement in October, a reflection of the fact that while the deal’s logic is impeccable, the valuation left something to be desired. FCA’s stock, by contrast, is up 16% from the undisturbed price, despite the headwinds generated by a legal action from General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced in the meantime.
Wednesday’s announcement did add some fresh insights into how the group will balance the interests of its biggest shareholders – on FCA’s side, the Exor holding company of the Agnelli family, and on PSA’s side, the French state and Dongfeng Automotive. 
Under the proposed by-laws of the combined company, no shareholder would hold over 30% of the overall voting rights, and there will be no automatic carryover of the existing double voting rights exercised by the French government. However, new double voting rights will accrue after a three-year holding period after completion of the merger, something that will bolster the position of strategic shareholders vis-à-vis the free shareholders, but not against one another. 
Moreover, Dongfeng will pare its shareholding to 4.5% of the combined group by selling 31 million shares back to Peugeot. They’ll be cancelled before the deal closes. There was no mention of a lockup for Dongfeng after the deal completes, although Exor and the Peugeot family will be subject to a three-year lock-up. 
Importantly, the groups haven’t changed their estimate of 3.7 billion euros in synergies from the deal, almost half of which will come from building over two-thirds of their vehicles on just two basic vehicle platforms. It expects one-off integration costs of 2.8 billion euros.
The two groups repeated that that estimate is based on the assumption of no plant closures, although it did not specifically promise not to close any plants. Speculation has swirled around the plants that Peugeot bought from General Motors (NYSE:GM) two years ago, notably those in the U.K., which are soon to find themselves on the wrong side of the EU’s customs posts.
Elsewhere, European stocks were broadly mixed. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.3, recovering from Tuesday's Brexit-related shock, while Germany's DAX fell 0.1% despite the Ifo business climate index rising to its highest in six months, adding to signs of stabilization in Europe's largest economy. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.2%, led by the international names that profit from sterling weakness."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is on course to end 2019 with all major civil aircraft programmes showing a book-to-bill ratio above one, chief commercial jet salesman Christian Scherer said on Wednesday.
In a year marked by trade tensions and U.S. tariffs, Airbus turned in a strong performance that may reach gross sales of 1,000 planes, Scherer suggested - adding that trade duties nonetheless posed a ""very serious problem"" for airline clients.
A book-to-bill ratio above one would signify a higher value in new orders than for deliveries during the year, after Airbus notched up 940 gross sales in the first 11 months.
""We are very satisfied indeed with our sales performance,"" Scherer said on a conference call organised by France's AJPAE aerospace media association.
He also denied that Airbus stood to benefit from rival Boeing's (N:BA) decision to suspend production of its grounded 737 MAX jet after two deadly crashes, emphasising that the disruption would hurt the sector at large.
""We're in a growth industry,"" Scherer said. ""When you have one player that isn't playing its part, it's extremely destructive.""
The eventual development of a larger version of the Airbus A220 was ""not a question of if, but when"", Scherer said, adding that it is not currently under consideration.
A replacement for the larger A320 jet family will also have to wait for a breakthrough improvement in environmental and economic performance unlikely before the 2030s, Scherer said.

Middle-eastern hospital operator NMC Health (LON:NMC) hit back at short seller Muddy Waters Research, saying the accusations it published on Tuesday ""appear principally unfounded, baseless and misleading, containing many errors of fact.""
It said it would review the ""assertions, insinuations and accusations"" and respond in due course.
NMC Health plunged over 32% on Tuesday, losing $2.4 billion in market value, after Muddy Waters, owned by Carson Black, alleged it inflated cash balances and understated its debt. 
The healthcare chain has enough confidence in its balance sheet to have announced a $200 million dollar share buyback program at the beginning of the month, as well as buying back $90 million of subordinated debt earlier this week.
Educational publisher   Pearson   (LON:PSON) said it will sell its remaining 25% stake in publishing firm Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann for 530 million pounds ($675 million). It will return 350 million pounds of the proceeds to shareholders through a share buyback.
The company also said CEO John Fallon will retire in 2020, but will stay on until a successor has been appointed to ensure an orderly succession.

Plumbing and heating group Ferguson (LON:FERG) said it’s appointed Simon Oakley as CEO of the U.K. business that it is currently in the process of demerging.
Oakley is at present CEO of Ferguson's Canadian business and head of corporate development. Since September, he has also been project managing the   Wolseley   (LON:FERG) U.K. demerger process.
He replaces Mark Higson, who is leaving the company.

Centamin criticised Endeavour for not providing the information it needed to conduct due diligence ahead of the proposed combination.
Under stock exchange rules, Endeavour has until the end of the year to make a formal proposal or else end its interest. Centamin said it would review whether to seek an extension of that deadline if it receives the information it needs before then.

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>",Explainer: Australia's biggest banks reel from string of scandals,"By Pete Schroeder
(Reuters) - Australia's banking industry is reeling from a series of regulatory scandals. Here is a broad summary of the issues:
Why are major Australian banks in trouble?
Australian banks are still feeling the fallout from a year long government-led inquiry into the sector, which wrapped up in February. That revealed rampant wrongdoing across the industry, including fees charged to the accounts of dead people and bribes paid to win mortgage business.
The inquiry also found regulators had been too lenient in their oversight of banks, with reported misconduct often met with light penalties or left completely unpunished.
The government recommended overhauling how the nation's banks are regulated and executives are paid, and referred two dozen cases for possible legal action.
The nation's four largest banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) - have set aside over A$8 billion ($5.4 billion) to refund customers for overcharged fees, miss-sold products and non-compliant financial advice stemming from the probe.
In October, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced it was considering a probe into competition issues in the retail banking sector, which is dominated by those four banks.
Which bank is accused of what?
In November, Westpac was sued by Australian regulators over 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws, the country's biggest ever such scandal. Westpac accepted most of the regulator's assertions, which included the facilitation of payments to child exploiters. Its CEO and compliance head have quit, while the chairman brought forward his retirement to early 2020.
At CBA, bank executives have agreed to pay 41,000 current and former employees nearly A$25 million ($16.97 million) after a review found they had been underpaid.
The bank's life insurance arm also was convicted in November of 87 counts of breaking a law banning unsolicited sales calls.
The bank also agreed to pay A$700 million ($529.27 million) in 2018 - Australia's biggest-ever corporate fine - to settle charges of money laundering control lapses.
Meanwhile, ANZ plans to refund owners of 3.4 million customer accounts after the inquiry revealed it wrongly charged fees.
And NAB has been sued by Australia's securities regulator, which alleges the company charged financial advice customers ""fees for no service,"" even as the Royal Commission criticized the practice during its probe.
What is next?
Westpac potentially faces a massive fine, as each transaction carries a maximum penalty of A$21 million ($14 million). The bank's executives may also be held personally liable as the prudential regulator uses new laws to scrutinize personal accountability for the payments.
The Australian operations of several global investment banks are also separately under scrutiny, as prosecutors allege cartel activity by employees at  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) stemming from a 2015 ANZ stock sale. 
Prosecutors argue the banks agreed to secretly keep unsold shares from the A$2.5 billion offering to support the share price, and, in doing so, formed a criminal cartel. Six current and former banks from Citi, Deutsche and ANZ also face charges.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), which worked on the deal with the two other investment banks, has been cooperating with the authorities since 2016 in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Trade groups representing some of the world's biggest firms plan to lobby U.S. officials and Indian lawmakers in a bid to dilute parts of an Indian privacy bill which could hurt businesses, three sources familiar with the plans told Reuters.
The Personal Data Protection Bill, which India's government argues is necessary to protect user privacy, will require companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB) to change how they store and process Indian users' data.
Industry executives say some provisions will raise costs and compliance requirements. One provision empowers the government to ask a company to provide anonymised user data to help formulate policies - data companies are loathe to share as it is crucial to fuel business growth.
Submitted by the government last week, the bill will be reviewed by a 30-member parliamentary panel.
The U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, plans to lobby Indian parliamentarians who will review the bill and will hold meetings with key U.S. government officials, said one source.
The council may also lead a delegation to India early next year to meet the parliamentary panel, the source added.
The sources declined to comment as the lobbying plans have not been made public.
The plans signal India's privacy bill could deepen bilateral strains. Washington has been upset with new stringent data storage rules that affect credit card companies and has also protested against e-commerce rules which have hurt firms such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Meenakshi Lekhi, the head of the parliamentary panel and a lawmaker from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, told Reuters the committee will try to have ""the widest possible consultations"".
She added, however, that she will seek legal advice on ""the participation"" of a foreign lobby group during the panel's deliberations.
USIBC said in a statement it was assessing the bill and will engage with the government and other stakeholders ""to ensure that industry perspectives on the bill are incorporated"".
Another influential lobby group, the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, has told its members it plans to work with other industry bodies and speak to U.S. officials as it looks to address industry concerns on the privacy bill, a second source said.
The group said in a statement it was still assessing the bill.
India is the latest country to seek tighter control over data and domestic operations of global tech firms. Vietnam has passed a law for technology firms to store ""important"" personal data on users in the country. Australia last year passed a bill that gave police access to encrypted data."
1433,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 12:53AM ET</span>","PG&E Wins Court Sign-Off on Fire Deals, Now Faces Governor","(Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp. won court approval for two multibillion-dollar wildfire settlements that will serve as the centerpiece of the bankrupt utility giant’s restructuring plan. It’s still working on winning over California’s governor.
On Tuesday, the judge overseeing PG&E’s Chapter 11 case signed off on the company’s $13.5 billion plan to compensate victims of catastrophic fires blamed on its equipment and an $11 billion deal to settle claims with insurers and investors. The agreements are key to the San Francisco-based company’s efforts to emerge from the biggest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history by a state-imposed deadline of June 30.
Judge Dennis Montali’s approval came less than a week after California Governor Gavin Newsom rejected PG&E’s restructuring plan, saying it didn’t comply with state law. His rebuke had threatened to derail the utility’s settlement with wildfire victims, but the utility was able to salvage the deal at the last minute by stripping away a clause requiring the governor’s blessing. The company said it’s still in negotiations with the governor’s office in an effort to resolve their differences.
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 in January after its power lines were tied to deadly blazes that erupted across Northern California in 2017 and 2018, leading to an estimated $30 billion worth of liabilities. Settling claims tied to those fires has emerged as the biggest obstacle in the utility’s exit from bankruptcy.
The judge’s approval lends support to the company’s efforts and deals a blow to a rival restructuring plan put forth by bondholders including Pacific Investment Management Co. and Elliott Management Corp., who had their own $13.5 billion agreement with wildfire victims before PG&E reached a separate agreement. A representative for the creditors group wasn’t immediately available for comment.
The company separately reached a $1.7 billion agreement with California utility regulators to settle violations tied to the catastrophic blazes that its equipment sparked in 2017 and 2018 -- including the Camp Fire, the deadliest in state history.
PG&E Shares
PG&E shares briefly rose in after-hours trading before returning to $10.91, where they had settled when the market closed Tuesday.
Montali, who decided on the deals during a hearing in San Francisco, said wildfire victims continue to be the most important creditor group in PG&E’s bankruptcy case. Montali didn’t want to “second guess” the choice of wildfire victims who, unlike other creditors, didn’t choose to be part of this bankruptcy, he said.
PG&E’s lawyer had argued in court that if the judge rejected the settlement with wildfire victims, the company wouldn’t be able to exit bankruptcy before the state’s June deadline.“We think the path is clear,” said Stephen Karotkin, an attorney for the utility. “It is imperative that you approve that settlement today, to jettison that settlement would put us back in a litigation morass.”
The Governor
PG&E’s full restructuring plan will face Newsom yet again. Any proposal would have to be approved by the governor-appointed state Public Utilities Commission. And if the company wants to participate in a new wildfire insurance fund to avoid future catastrophic losses, it’ll have to prove to the state that it has fully resolved its bankruptcy and past wildfire liabilities by next June.
Newsom won’t oppose the terms of PG&E’s agreement to compensate wildfire victims, but still opposes the power company’s overall reorganization plan, said Nancy Mitchell, a lawyer for the governor. His office didn’t want to stand in the way of a settlement that is a “fair treatment” for victims, she said.Montali said granting the motion is “not a power play saying I know more than the governor.”
Montali’s decision on the victims’ settlement could avert a potentially lengthy trial that was set to begin next year to determine PG&E’s liabilities and damages tied to the wildfires. A U.S. district judge and lawyers involved in that case said earlier on Tuesday that the trial would probably be abandoned if the settlement with fire victims was approved in bankruptcy court.
Cecily Dumas, an attorney representing wildfire victims, had urged the court to approve the settlement in the interest in moving PG&E’s bankruptcy case forward.“This was not an easy decision and it was not an easy negotiation -- many, many individuals have been agonizing over this compromise,” she said, adding that 70% of lawyers representing victims supported the settlement.

1434,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 12:53AM ET</span>",China Liquidity Jitters Are About to Test Bond Market Again,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s government-bond investors will soon be looking for reassurance from the central bank that there’s plenty of cash in the financial system.
The country will see a “liquidity hole” of 2.8 trillion yuan ($400 billion) in January, in large part because people across the nation will withdraw cash for the Lunar New Year holiday, according to Guotai Junan Securities Co. That means bond traders expect the central bank to unlock funds to avoid the liquidity-driven panic seen in October, when the benchmark 10-year yield spiked the most in six months.
Some analysts expect the People’s Bank of China to cut the amount of cash lenders must hold as reserves. It could also opt to inject funds through its daily open-market operations, others say. But no analyst is calling for a massive net liquidity injection or a benchmark interest-rate cut, as Beijing won’t want to risk inflating prices when the consumer price index is at a seven-year high. That’s capping gains for government bonds, as it has for months.
“Bonds will get a short-term boost next month as China may cut reserve ratios to offset the liquidity drainage,” said Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., adding this can’t be viewed as the start of a broad easing cycle. “The central bank just wants to tailor the solution to the liquidity problem. The long-term outlook for the debt market will still hinge on China’s economy and the trade negotiations.”
Cash supply tends to tighten ahead of the week-long holiday, which in 2020 falls at the end of January. Households and corporates typically withdraw money from banks to pay for gifts and travel. That alone will drain 1.5 trillion yuan from the financial system next month, Guotai Junan analysts led by Hua Changchun wrote in a note.
Another 1.3 trillion yuan will be drained due to factors such as banks buying newly issued local government bonds, according to China’s second-largest brokerage. More than 2 trillion yuan of those notes mature in 2020, and fresh debt to refinance the borrowing thus shoring up economic growth will probably start hitting the market soon. China in November ordered local governments to speed up the issuance of “special bonds” earmarked for infrastructure projects.
The central bank reduced the reserve requirement ratio by 1 percentage point before the holiday this year, and also injected more than 1 trillion yuan via open-market operations over a week. In 2018, a targeted RRR cut went into effect before the celebrations. The 10-year sovereign yield edged lower in the month before Lunar New Year in both years.
On Wednesday, the PBOC injected a net 200 billion yuan into the financial system via reverse repurchase agreements after skipping those operations for 20 sessions. It also lowered the rate on 14-day reverse repos to 2.65% from 2.7%.
Worst Isn’t Over for Chinese Bonds as Supply Surge Looms
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). economist Liu Li-gang said the central bank will cut RRR to unleash cash because it “can immediately inject massive liquidity to the system.” Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura International Ltd., said Beijing is more likely to offer medium-term loans to banks instead -- or the targeted version of that tool. Rising consumer prices, fueled by the surging cost of pork, are seen capping how much liquidity Beijing can provide without further stoking inflation.
The policy dilemma has cornered China’s government-bond investors, with the yield stuck in a 6-basis-point range over the past month. While the economy is growing at its slowest pace since the 1990s, November data was more encouraging. Throw in a phase-one trade deal agreed with the U.S. last week, and Beijing has even fewer reasons to go aggressive on stimulus measures.
It all means that after a brief spell in the sun in January, a rally in Chinese sovereign debt is unlikely to last. The return of risk appetite is already hurting the notes, with the 10-year yield rising to the highest level in a month on Tuesday. The rate rate was little changed at 3.23% as of 9:45 a.m. in Shanghai.
“In 2020, the bond market will be torn by transitory improvements in sentiment, triggered by the trade deal and economic data, and concerns on long-term growth and risks such as defaults,” said David Qu, an economist for Bloomberg Economics.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 12:46AM ET</span>",Era of low sovereign bond yields to persist well into 2020: Reuters poll,"By Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Major sovereign debt yields will feel the pull of gravity well into next year, with the U.S. 10-year benchmark barely rising by the end of 2020, according to a Reuters poll of fixed-income strategists.
Stock markets have soared this year, with most major indices registering double-digit returns on an improving trade outlook and central banks reverting to easy policies.
That has pushed down most sovereign bond yields to below where they were at the start of 2019, completely wrong-footing bond strategists who this time last year forecast the 10-year Treasury note (US10YT=RR) would rise to 3.30%. It's now at 1.85%.
Economic growth and inflation expectations in major economies are relatively subdued, although in better shape than thought a few months ago, and so the 85 experts polled by Reuters have tamed their expectations for yields accordingly.
Fixed-income strategists forecast the U.S. 10-year Treasury would yield 1.9% by end-2020, according to their median projection. That is just 5 basis points higher than where it is now, the smallest 12-month predicted increase in 17 years of Reuters polls on major sovereign bond markets.
Yields on Germany's 10-year bunds and Japanese government bonds are expected to stay negative for the next 12 months. British 10-year gilts are forecast to yield less than 1.0% for the same period. The yield is currently about 0.8%
""It's our view that the era of low bond yields will continue. When you have economic growth between 1% and 2% and inflation expectations really mute at the same time, there's not much forcing bond yields higher,"" said James Orlando, senior economist at TD.
""That's just the world we live in right now. Until you see economic growth really starting to accelerate, like consistent 2%-3% growth, bond yields close to 2% is probably what you'll be looking at in the U.S.""
While fears of a U.S. recession and an escalating trade war with China pushed major sovereign bond yields to multi-year lows in September, improvement in sentiment on both fronts has not translated into analysts predicting major changes in the sovereign bond market.
UK GILTS SEEN MOST AT RISK
A significant minority of analysts - 12 out of 27 - who answered an additional question on which major sovereign bonds were most at risk of a sell-off in 2020 chose UK gilts.
Eight picked U.S. Treasuries and the rest, seven, chose German Bunds.
Among analysts who answered a separate question, 17 of 33 - a near-split - said risks to their yield forecasts were skewed more to the upside.
The rest, 16, said risks were skewed to the downside.
""The combination of slightly better economic data and trade war tensions easing has been the main driver of markets,"" said Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank.
""Ultimately we think this will not be sustained and we will see resumption of declines in yields.""
A much-awaited ""Phase One"" trade deal between the U.S. and China, following a couple of years of tensions and tit-for-tat tariff hikes, has not yet done much beyond push up the stock market.
Among analysts who answered a question on what was likely to happen to U.S. Treasury yields if there was clear evidence of both countries working towards resolving their trade dispute, 17 of 32 said there would be a significant pick-up.
A remaining 14 said there would be no material impact, and only one said there would be a significant decline.
""In the short-term we are being led around by the nose over these trade headlines ... it'll (a trade deal) certainly help boost yields in the short term but it's not going to last more than a couple of weeks,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 11:16PM ET</span>",China IPO hopefuls surge to three-year high encouraged by market reform,"By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The number of companies seeking to go public in mainland China has jumped to about 580, a three-year high, encouraged by a slew of market reforms and a bumper year for equity financing in 2019.
It includes 420 Chinese firms waiting approval to list in Shanghai or Shenzhen, official data shows, while another 161 have applied to Shanghai's six-month-old STAR Market, China's answer to Nasdaq.
The combined number is double levels a year earlier, and the most since 2016, when there was a long queue of IPO hopefuls after officials shut down entry into the market for four months following a string of boom-and-bust listings.
""I expect China's IPO activity will continue to be very active next year, thanks to greater inclusiveness toward IPOs, and additional capital inflows,"" said Yang Wang, assurance partner at accounting firm EY.
The good times for China IPOs contrast with weak markets for listings globally, with sentiment hit by trade tensions and some high-profile IPO flops. Worldwide, the number of IPOs tumbled 19% in 2019 and fundraising shrank 4%, EY said.
Also helping has been a climb of 30% for China's benchmark CSI300 Index (CSI300), one of the world's best-performing major indexes this year due in part to foreign inflows after Chinese stocks were included in global benchmarks.
Some 200 Chinese companies have listed on the mainland this year, almost doubling from the total for 2018, and money raised jumped 82% to a seven-year high of 252.8 billion yuan ($35.9 billion), EY said.
The biggest reform has been the creation of the STAR Market, which has a shorter approval process and is the first mainland China exchange-run board to not make profitability a listing requirement.
Widely seen as Beijing's latest move to become self-sufficient in core technologies, it and other mainland boards have gained momentum as companies seek cash amid bruising trade tensions with the United States. In contrast, U.S. listings by Chinese companies have slumped.
Keen to reduce the Chinese economy's heavy reliance on bank lending, policymakers are likely to continue with reforms in 2020, with Shenzhen's star-up board ChiNext expected to be revamped in an effort to replicate the STAR Market's success.
Beijing has also drafted plans to improve the country's New Third Board, a now-lifeless equity market that was initially designed to fund small companies.
""China is seeking to establish a multi-layered capital market,"" said Gui Haoming, analyst at Shenwan Hongyuan Securities.
""The key is to reinvigorate the (stock) market, improve its efficiency, and give it a bigger role in allocating capital."""

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 10:21PM ET</span>",Hong Kong exchange to slash IPO price-to-trading gap in 2020: executive,"By Alun John and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Hong Kong Stock Exchange hopes to slash the time between pricing an IPO and the shares trading to a single day as early as late 2020, bringing the bourse into line with rivals such as New York, a senior executive told Reuters.
Investors and investment bankers complain that Hong Kong's current initial public offering (IPO) settlement of five trading days leaves them exposed to market falls between the shares pricing and trading. It also makes it harder for the city to compete for IPOs with rival exchanges such as New York.
Christina Bao, head of global issuer services at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) (HK:0388), said the exchange planned to shorten the settlement period to a single day and hoped to achieve this by the fourth quarter of 2020.
""This has been becoming more and more important for investors because of the volatility of the market these days,"" Bao said in an interview. ""In today's environment, any big news can come out overnight.""
It is the first time the exchange has given specific details about its plans, having previously said only that it was considering changes to the settlement process.
Retail investors' traditional use of paper forms had long been considered a barrier to faster settlements because of the time needed to allow for post and processing.
But  Alibaba  (HK:9988) (N:BABA) recently carried out Hong Kong's first paperless listing, when it raised $12.9 billion, proving it could be done.
Bao said too that HKEX's listing committee - a group of market professionals who must approve each company's IPO application - was considering reforms that could make the pricing of IPOs more flexible.
Hong Kong topped the global charts in 2018 for IPO fundraising and sits third this year, having raised $24.2 billion, behind Nasdaq and Riyadh, which recently hosted the up-to $29 billion IPO of Saudi oil giant Aramco (SE:2222).
If the Alibaba listing were included, Hong Kong would have topped the chart with $37.1 billion.
Bao said she did not see the political turmoil in Hong Kong, which has been shaken by six months of often-violent anti-government protests, deterring international companies from raising money in the Asian financial hub.
""We have been working hard exploring opportunities, especially in Southeast Asia,"" she said.
Even if the region's emerging tech unicorns listed on their home exchanges, they could also list in Hong Kong to raise money from international investors and strengthen ties with their Chinese investors and counterparts, she added."
1439,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 09:53PM ET</span>",Chinese leader Xi visits gambling hub Macau as nearby Hong Kong seethes,"By Farah Master
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's President Xi Jinping begins a three-day visit to the gambling hub of Macau on Wednesday to mark the 20th anniversary of its handover to China, with security tight as protests rock nearby Hong Kong.
Xi's visit to the former Portuguese colony, where he is expected to announce a slew of supportive policies, is widely seen as a reward for Macau's stability and loyalty, unlike the former British colony of Hong Kong, which has been rocked by anti-government protests for six months.
Xi is expected to announce measures for Macau aimed at diversifying its casino-dependent economy into a financial center, including a new yuan-denominated stock exchange.
The full schedule of Xi's visit, his longest official trip to Macau, has not been announced but he will attend the swearing-in of Macau's newly chosen Beijing-backed leader, Ho Iat-seng, on Friday.
Macau returned to Chinese rule on Dec. 20, 1999 with the same ""one country, two systems"" formula aimed at preserving autonomy under which Hong Kong is governed. 
While protesters in Hong Kong, across the mouth of the Pearl River, are infuriated by what they see as Beijing encroaching on their freedoms, Macau has seen little dissent.
Protests are very rare in the territory with more than half of Macau's 620,000 population immigrating from China in recent decades.
Still, authorities have tried to stave off any trouble. 
A Hong Kong resident was arrested by mainland police last week while crossing into Macau on a newly built bridge linking it to Hong Kong and the mainland city of Zhuhai.
Chinese authorities said the man was suspected of involvement in a phone-smuggling syndicate.
The heads of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and several journalists have also been barred from entering the city in the run-up to Xi's visit, the chamber heads and media reported.
It was not clear why. The chamber heads said authorities did not give a reason.
Macau ferry operator Turbo Jet said it was reducing the number of ferry sailings to and from Hong Kong by about half due to security checks. Ferries this week are only operating every 30 minutes compared with every 15 minutes normally. 
The changes were made because of ""instructions by Macau authorities"", the company said on its website.
The city's light rail transit system which opened to the public on Dec. 10, will be suspended for three days from Wednesday due to security measures, the operator said. 
Beijing has also clamped down on visas since November for mainland residents going to Macau until after the Dec. 20 anniversary, as part of the security restrictions, according to Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong.
The restrictions would put additional pressure on sliding gambling revenues, he said.

Macau is heavily dependent on the gambling industry with its casinos contributing about 80 percent of government income.

(Reuters) - An associate producer on the CBS current affairs TV show ""60 Minutes"" filed a lawsuit on Tuesday alleging gender discrimination and retaliation by the company after she complained about inappropriate conduct by her boss. 
In the complaint, filed in New York State Supreme Court against CBS Broadcasting, Cassandra Vinograd, who is London-based, said she told company executives that her boss, ""60 Minutes"" producer Michael Gavshon, texted her a photo that made her feel ""disgusted, uncomfortable and scared.""
Gavshon, 63, said he meant to send the photo to his sister, according to the complaint.
CBS News, which is part of ViacomCBS , said it ""plans to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.""
""CBS thoroughly and immediately investigated the matter in accordance with its policies,"" the network said in the statement. ""Subsequently, Ms. Vinograd asked to no longer work with Mr. Gavshon and CBS has made every reasonable effort to honor this request. CBS News vehemently denies there was any retaliation.""
In a statement sent from CBS, Gavshon said he had intended to send the photo to his sister and that he reported the incident and cooperated with a company investigation. 
According to the complaint, the CBS human resources department conducted an investigation after Vinograd raised the issue. Human resources advised her to stay home if she was uncomfortable working with Gavshon, and told her she should meet with Gavshon and try to ""work through"" things, according to the complaint.
After the investigation, Vinograd was stripped of all work responsibilities, according to the complaint.
CBS executives have been the subject of other sexual harassment allegations in recent years. Anchor Charlie Rose, CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS_old) President Leslie Moonves and ""60 Minutes"" Executive Producer Jeff Fager were all fired from the company or resigned under pressure. 
Rose apologized for his ""inappropriate behavior."" Fager has denied allegations of sexual harassment.
Moonves has denied any wrongdoing and has described his sexual encounters as consensual.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>",U.S. judge approves PG&E deal with California wildfire victims; stock jumps,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge approved on Tuesday PG&E Corp's $13.5 billion settlement with victims of Californian wildfires, and the company's stock rallied as the utility gained momentum to emerge from bankruptcy in June as planned.
""I don't think we've heard a single person say it's a bad settlement,"" U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali said during a six-hour hearing in San Francisco.
The settlement provides cash and PG&E stock to a trust for the benefit of individual wildfire victims. 
Montali also approved an $11 billion agreement with insurance companies, locking up the last and two most significant creditor groups.
Adding momentum to PG&E's plan, a lawyer for Governor Gavin Newsom told Montali the governor viewed the wildfire settlement as fair. ""We don't want to stand in the way of that,"" Nancy Mitchell said. 
On Friday, Newsom rejected the PG&E reorganization plan and said the company would need a new board of directors and stronger finances to comply with a recently enacted wildfire law, known as AB 1054.
Mitchell said the necessary changes to the plan could be negotiated, although she called the governor's demands a ""high bar.""
Newsom has accused the company of putting profit ahead of maintenance of its power lines and of poorly managing the widespread blackouts PG&E used to avoid sparking wildfires during high winds.
Opponents of the $13.5 billion agreement, led by bondholders, wanted Montali to strike a provision that obligates lawyers for victims to support PG&E's plan to exit bankruptcy.
Bondholders want wildfire victims to have the option to support their competing bankruptcy exit plan, which they argued could be a fallback if PG&E failed to satisfy the governor.
The bondholder plan would wipe out the company's stock value and while the bondholders have argued their plan was better for wildfire victims, a lawyer for the victims said it would face a tougher time getting confirmed by the court.
PG&E's stock jumped about 13% to $10.91 a share and regained most the ground lost after Newsom's rejection of the company's bankruptcy plan.
The company's plan needs approval from Newsom and Montali by June 30 to participate in the wildfire fund, which reduces liability for investor-owned utilities but requires them to spend billions of dollars upgrading equipment.

PG&E filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in January facing 70,000 legal claims from at least 22 fires from 2017 and 2018, with victims seeking $36 billion.

(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) on Tuesday issued its second warning for fiscal 2020 profit as it spent heavily to launch Sunday delivery in time for the holidays, the continued tariff fight restrained global trade, and it grappled with fallout from its breakup with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
FedEx shares dropped 6.5% to $152.60 in extended trade after it also said the late arrival of Thanksgiving shifted revenue from Cyber Monday into December, hurting results in its quarter ended Nov. 30. 
""We incurred peak ramp-up costs in Q2, with none of the revenue benefit,"" Rajesh Subramaniam, FedEx president said on a conference call with analysts. 
""Our hopes for a restoration and trade growth expressed last June have simply not materialized due to the trade dispute,"" said Fred Smith, FedEx's founder and chief executive.
FedEx's adjusted net income fell 38.9% to $660 million, or $2.51 per share, for the fiscal second quarter, missing analysts' average estimate for a profit of $2.76 a share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Operating margin in the FedEx Ground segment tumbled to 6.4% from 11.5% a year ago, largely related to the cost of adding Sunday, or 7-day, delivery. 
At Express, its plane-focused fast delivery service, operating margin fell to 2.6% from 6.6% a year ago, after weak industrial production contributed to softness in its higher-profit commercial business. 
In September, FedEx lowered its earnings forecast for the year ending May 2020, to $11 to $13 per share. On Tuesday, it cut that to $10.25 to $11.50 per share, citing missed revenue targets in all transportation segments and higher residential delivery costs.
This holiday season is six days shorter than last year, pressuring package delivery firms at a time when retailers are demanding speedier deliveries. 
Sriram Sridhar, CEO of LateShipment.com, tracks last-mile deliveries and said data culled from clients suggest that FedEx is lagging rival  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) Inc's on-time performance in large cities like Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston and New York. 
Up to 15% of FedEx ground packages are delayed in some of the worst-hit areas, said Sridhar, forecasting that by the end of the season FedEx could have 1%-2% more delays than UPS.

Amazon this week temporarily blocked certain third-party sellers from using the FedEx Ground delivery network to handle Prime shipments as the online retailer strives to hit accelerated delivery deadlines. FedEx this summer terminated its contracts with Amazon, which is building a competing logistics network.

The credit line is part of SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) $9.5 billion bailout that was announced in October when money-losing WeWork was on the brink of running out of cash after its plans to go public were abruptly withdrawn a month earlier.
The three-part bailout included a tender offer of up to $3 billion to buy privately held WeWork shares, the acceleration of a $1.5 billion payment from SoftBank that was due next year, and some $5 billion in new debt including the line of credit.
""We are pleased that WeWork and SoftBank Group Corp have entered into a commitment letter with Goldman Sachs for a new $1.75 billion senior secured letter of credit facility,"" WeWork said in a statement.
""The facility is in the process of syndication and is expected to be available in January,"" WeWork said.
WeWork will not be required to post cash collateral on the new credit facility, the statement said.
When the bailout was announced, SoftBank said funding for the new debt would occur after the tender offer was completed.
The tender has launched but is not expected to be finished until the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
The Goldman-backed letter of credit is expected to free up about $800 million in restricted cash, the source said."

The latest figures compiled by TheCityUK reflect continued resilience in Britain's biggest economic sector despite predictions of a decline after the country voted in 2016 by 52% to 48% to leave the EU.
TheCityUK, which promotes Britain's financial sector abroad, said on Wednesday that net exports of financial and related legal and accounting services grew by 5% to an estimated 82.8 billion pounds in 2018, up from 79 billion pounds in 2017.
Financial services exports alone totaled 61.9 billion pounds last year, making Britain still the world's leading net exporter in the sector.
Just over 40% of exports went to the EU, followed by 26.6% to the United States.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose Conservative Party won a resounding victory in last Thursday's national election, has said Brexit is on track for January 31, followed by a business-as-usual transition period to the end of 2020.
But Britain said on Tuesday it would outlaw any extension of the transition period beyond 2020, raising the possibility that the country could end up trading with its most important market on World Trade Organization terms - more burdensome for business.
Britain's financial sector wants the EU to grant at least some form of basic access to the bloc after the transition ends, though more than 300 banks, insurers and asset managers have opened hubs in the bloc in case this does not happen."
1447,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 07:05PM ET</span>",Boeing 737 MAX freeze divides suppliers into haves and have-nots,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's decision to suspend aerospace's biggest production line exposes contrasts in the U.S.-dominated 737 MAX supply chain, severely straining some niche machine shops while giving engine giants time to iron out their own wrinkles.
The temporary 737 MAX production halt, the latest fallout in a 9-month-old grounding crisis, has already kicked off tough negotiations between Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc , Boeing's largest 737 supplier, one industry source said.
Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit has staffed its factory with enough workers to maintain a pre-crisis build rate of 52 aircraft per month and to enable a smooth step-by-step eventual increase to 57 aircraft, the person said. 
Now, furloughs in Kansas are likely if Boeing stops paying Spirit to build and store fuselages at those rates, the person said, adding that scenario was likely as Boeing looks to conserve cash. A second supply chain source agreed. 
""No way can they keep going,"" he said.
Spirit declined comment. 
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on discussions with suppliers. He referred to a Monday statement that Boeing will work to ""sustain the gains in production system and supply chain quality and health made over the last many months."" 
The fallout depends on how long Boeing's freeze lasts, and how much if any compensation Boeing pays to prop up some of the roughly 680 suppliers that feed its best-selling program.
Payments may not come quickly. 
Planemakers rarely signal any intention to help the supply chain in advance, otherwise hundreds of healthy firms would demand compensation immediately, the supply chain source said. Instead, Boeing will assess impacts and may quietly help some companies bridge the gap until production resumes, he said.
Boeing will be caught in two conflicting pressures: the need to conserve cash, and maintaining its ability to ratchet production upwards once the MAX starts flying again - a goal behind Boeing's decision not to lay off any employees.
""The potential loss of talent, access to capital and incremental risk on the supply chain all create substantial uncertainty about Boeing's ability to increase production levels once the pause ends,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said. 
MOM AND POP
About 80% of Boeing's closely guarded recurring costs in building the mature 737 - a figure that some sources place as low as $10 million per plane, a fraction of $40 million to $50 million estimated market value - involve payments to outside suppliers for parts.
Boeing said it does not disclose that ratio.
Big, diversified suppliers of systems like avionics and landing gear - like United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) or Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) - will be relatively insulated because their revenue is spread across other Boeing and Airbus programs. They can also tap lucrative after-sales parts and repair services.
But providers of materials or structures, ranging from Spirit to a cluster of mom-and-pop machine shops in Washington state, where the 737 MAX is made, will be disproportionately exposed because those parts are sold once and rarely replaced.
One worried U.S. Pacific Northwest supplier quickly called a Boeing contact after headlines predicted output cuts.
""We are already under contract for parts,"" he said. ""We have already bought material, we already have labor into it.""
His factory has 16 weeks to deliver a part to the 737 factory in Renton, south of Seattle, and Boeing in turn has 90 days to pay. ""All of our costs are up front. We have a lot invested,"" he said.
The shutdown comes as the world's largest planemaker is urging suppliers to cut prices or give up a greater share of the after-sales market for parts and repairs - the focus of Boeing's own new services business.
One U.S.-based hardware supplier has watched its Boeing order backlog slide over the past six months, making 2020 sales forecasts difficult.
Engine-makers have a silver lining, however.
CFM International, a joint venture between  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), makes engines for Boeing and rival Airbus. A slowdown for CFM means extra time to fine-tune new technology. 

""That's good news for Airbus,"" one of the sources said.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 05:58PM ET</span>","U.S. beer, spirits, wine industry escape big tax hike in year-end budget deal","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is moving to extend by another year tax breaks for beer, wine and distilled spirits worth hundreds of millions of dollars that were initially approved as part of tax reform in 2017.
Without the extension, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said it would have faced $275 million in higher taxes, while a beer industry group said it faced $130 million in higher taxes. One wine group said the bill will allow California fineries alone to avoid more than $150 million in higher taxes.
Bills to make the tax reductions permanent have overwhelming support in Congress. The House approved the spending bill on Tuesday that includes the tax provisions, while the Senate is expected to follow suit.
Chris Swonger, who heads the Distilled Spirits Council, said in a statement the measure would provide ""significant relief for craft distillers across the country who were facing a 400 percent tax increase beginning Jan. 1.""
Jim McGreevy, president and CEO of the Beer Institute, said the beer industry supports 2.1 million U.S. jobs. He said the bill will provide brewers and beer importers ""the certainty they need to continue growing their businesses, provide good-paying jobs across the country, and continue to serve Americans greater varieties of our nation’s most popular alcohol beverage.""
The tax breaks are worth $12 million annually to both Anheuser Busch InBev (BR:ABI) and  Molson Coors  Brewing Co (N:TAP). InBev did not immediately comment.
MillerCoors, the U.S. unit of Molson Coors, told distributors and others in an email seen by Reuters that ""in the spirit of partnership and consistent with the revenue-splitting approach of our economic model, we once again are passing on 30% of our savings to you.""
Robert P. Koch, president and CEO of Wine Institute, said the measure will ensure nearly 4,000 wineries across California can continue to grow. ""California wineries were able to re-invest over $150 million in tax savings in 2018 and 2019,"" Koch said.
The legislation reduces excise tax payments for all U.S. wineries by expanding the value of the existing producer credit and doing away with the phase-out that has prohibited many wineries from receiving any benefit. Excise tax payments for small- to medium-sized wineries are reduced by 55% or more.
Adam Looney, a fellow at the Brookings Tax Policy Center, noted the one-year extension has been estimated to cost $1.2 billion.

He added that while the measure was described as benefiting smaller firms, the ""vast majority of its tax cuts go to large distillery corporations and foreign spirits importers, ballooning the cost of the bill, undercutting the ability of truly small businesses to compete, and threatening public health.""

Stocks could get a dent at the start of trading tomorrow following very disappointing quarterly results from FedEx (NYSE:FDX) that also came with weak guidance.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported a fiscal second-quarter profit of $2.51 per share, well shy of the $2.82 per share analysts predicted, according to Investing.com’s consensus.
Revenue of $17.3 billion came in below forecasts for $17.6 billion.
Shares fell 6.4% in after-hours trading.
For fiscal 2020, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) now predicts a profit of $10.25 to $11.50 per share, down from previous guidance of $11 to $13 per share and a consensus of $12.02 per share from S&P Capital IQ.
The company blamed lower revenue at each of its transportation segments and higher expenses.
Politics will also be on the market's radar tomorrow as the House of Representatives will debate on and is expected to vote on the impeachment of President Donald Trump. But the impeachment proceedings have had little impact on stock prices so far.
2. Decline for Oil Inventories Forecast
Oil prices jumped today, hitting a three-month high following data showing strong economic performance in housing and manufacturing.
Traders will turn their attention to domestic inventory numbers tomorrow. The Energy Information Administration is expected to report a decline of about 1.3 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 13.
Gasoline inventories and distillate stockpiles are expected to have risen.
The American Petroleum Institute said stockpiles jumped by 4.7 million barrels when it reported its measure of weekly oil inventories late today. That took a large cut off of crude's gains for the day.
3. Micron, General Mills Results Roll In
Semiconductor company Micron (NASDAQ:MU) will get the attention of tech investors after the bell tomorrow when it reports earnings.
Ahead of the results, the stock has been receiving some strong endorsements from analysts, with two upgrades and a price-target hike in the last couple of days.
Wall Street is looking for a quarterly profit of 47 cents per share on revenue of $5 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Along with the numbers, investors will be looking for any reaction from management on the announcement of a phase one trade deal between the U.S. and China.
Micron (NASDAQ:MU) shares are up 23.7% this quarter and 67% on the year. 
Ahead of trading food company   General Mills   (NYSE:GIS) will report results.
Analysts predict that the maker of Cheerios and Pillsbury products earned 88 cents per share in the latest quarter on sales of $4.43 billion.
Its shares are up nearly 34% this year."
1452,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 05:02PM ET</span>","Stocks - Housing, Manufacturing Push Dow Higher","Investing.com - Stocks moved modestly higher Tuesday but still closed at new highs Tuesday thanks to strong reports on housing starts and manufacturing. The market's positive finish was its fifth in a row.
The S&P 500 finished up 0.03% after hitting a new intraday peak of 3,198.22. The Dow Jones industrials added 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%. The Nasdaq 100, up 0.06%, hit a new intraday high.
The market opened higher but slowly gave up more than half its early gains over the course of the session. 
Still, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are now looking at four-straight months of gains en route to their best annual performances since 2013.
Helping stocks were bullish reports on housing starts in November and factory output. The housing report from the Commerce Department showed single-family starts are up nearly 17% year over year and offers a big reason a National Association of Home Builders survey on Monday showed builder confidence at the highest levels since 1999.
Factory output rebounded by more than forecast in November,the Federal Reserve said. It also rose excluding a surge in auto production following the end of the General Motors (NYSE:GM) strike, Bloomberg News noted.
Financial, consumer discretionary and utility stocks were the top S&P 500 sectors. Real estate, technology and health care were the weakest.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was a big winner among communications services companies after releasing data showing growth in international markets. Its 3.7% gain on the day was tops among Nasdaq 100 stocks and second best among S&P 500 stocks.
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA),   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) and   Cardinal Health   (NYSE:CAH) were among the health sector's larger losers.
After the close, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares tumbled more than 6% after reporting weaker-than-expected earnings. The package-delivery company also cut its 2020 guidance, citing lower-than-expected revenue in all its transportation segments and higher-than-expected expenses. The latter issue is driven by a continued mix shift to residential delivery services.
The shares fell 0.5% ahead of the report. If the after-hours loss holds on Wednesday, FedEx's year-to-date gain will be wiped out. The stock is the weakest performer among components in the Dow Jones Transportation average, which is up about 18% this year.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) were among the top Dow stocks. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up slightly after a new intraday high.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) was flat. Late Monday, the company announced it will shut down production of its 737 Max airliner while it awaits government recertification.
United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), a key supplier, was among the biggest Dow losers.
While five days of gains will cheer bulls, the stock market has been opening fast each day and giving back a sizable portion of its early gains. That suggests some unease about how the market will perform in the longer term, especially with the on-going U.S.-China negotiations, impeachment and the prospect of a vitriolic U.S. election in the fall. 
A few technical indicators suggest the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are closing in on near-term tops. 
Oil prices were higher with WTI futures finishing above $60 a barrel for a third-straight day. Its close of $61.94 a barrel was its highest since mid-September, but gains were pared after the API reported a sizable rise in weekly inventories.
Brent crude was up 76 cents to $66.10.
Chemical producer   Albemarle   (NYSE:ALB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), fertilizer producer Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) and oil-and-gas producer   Cimarex Energy   (NYSE:XEC) were among the day's top S&P 500 stocks.
 Cardinal Health  (NYSE:CAH), telecom company   CenturyLink   (NYSE:CTL), and pharmaceutical distributors AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) and McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) were among the day's weakest S&P 500 stocks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. banking regulators signed off on Tuesday on ""living wills"" submitted by eight large U.S. banks, although the regulators said six of those plans had shortcomings that must be addressed.
The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said all the plans show how the banks could be safely dissolved in a crisis. But most of the banks struggled to produce key data, like how much capital and liquidity are held by subsidiaries, under stressed conditions. The issue did not rise to the level that the banks -- Bank of America (N:BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK),  Citigroup  (N:C),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  State Street  (N:STT) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) -- had their plans rejected, but they must tell the agencies how they will fix the issue by the end of March. 
The regulators did not identify shortcomings with plans from JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) or Goldman Sachs (N:GS).
Under rules established following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, large banks are regularly required to detail how they could be quickly and safely taken apart in a crisis. These resolution plans, commonly known as ""living wills,"" are assessed by regulators to see if they are feasible.
If banks cannot get regulators to sign off on their plans, they could face additional restrictions on their business activities or even be ordered to divest.
Banks originally had to submit the plans annually, but regulators decided in October to ease that requirement after banks argued it was too onerous and regulators could not assess the complex documents on such a schedule. Now, large U.S. banks can submit simpler plans every two years, and a full resolution plan every four years.

The last time large U.S. banks had such plans tested, regulators identified shortcomings with four of the banks' plans. They announced Tuesday that those shortcomings, from plans submitted by Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo, had been addressed.

1456,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 04:09PM ET</span>",Tech Industry Shudders as U.S. Weighs New Limits on Huawei Sales,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government is weighing new limits on sales of chips and other vital components to China’s Huawei Technologies Co., sparking another furious round of lobbying by technology companies.
Industry associations representing U.S. chipmakers, software companies and manufacturers have written to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross in recent weeks arguing against the changes, according to copies obtained by Bloomberg News. They urge President Donald Trump’s administration to at least hear them out before introducing tougher rules to close what U.S. officials consider loopholes letting American companies keep working with Huawei.
In May, the U.S. announced an export ban against Huawei, saying it’s a national security threat. The Chinese company’s placement on the so-called entity list means it is cut off from U.S. components, and American companies are required to get licenses to resume business with the firm. Huawei has denied it helps the Chinese government gain illicit access to information and that its equipment is insecure.
Some U.S. companies have continued selling to Huawei even after the blacklisting, citing rules that limit the government’s ability to restrict exports. De minimis provisions exempt certain products if companies can prove the majority of work done to create the items happens outside the U.S. The current threshold effectively kicks in when 75% of the work occurs overseas. The administration is considering raising that to 90%, and broadening the list of products, people familiar with the discussions said. The change could come as soon as January, added the people, who asked not to be identified discussing policy deliberations.
“Secretary Ross met with SIA and heard their views, as officials from the Department regularly engage with private industry,” a Commerce Department spokesman. “Moreover, the Department is constantly reviewing policies, along with its interagency partners, to better address national security, but the Department cannot speak to specific proposals that may or may not be under consideration.”
Many U.S. tech companies have operations outside the U.S. that help them argue their products are exempt. Chipmakers run design bureaus around the world to support 24-hour development cycles and many have outsourced manufacturing to Asian contractors. But if the de minimis threshold rises to 90%, the industry will struggle to keep slipping through this loophole.
“We respectfully request the Administration refrain from pursuing these regulatory changes and consider carefully the potentially significant harms they would cause,” John Neuffer, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, wrote in a Dec. 5 letter to Ross at the Commerce Department.
The U.S. government may publish the changes as final rules, not as a proposal that allows input from the industry and other stakeholders, added Neuffer, while imploring the administration not to pursue that approach.
The tech companies argue that a tougher Huawei ban only harms the U.S: Many of the components they supply to Huawei can be obtained elsewhere, so U.S. companies would lose sales to overseas rivals.
“Over the long term, companies in the U.S. would be forced to reduce investment in the research needed to maintain U.S. technology leadership, ultimately degrading the innovation that contributes to our economic leadership and national security,” Neuffer wrote.
U.S. tech companies have already struggled to comply with the original Huawei ban, while keeping access to the Chinese market, the largest in the world. The government in Beijing has threatened to retaliate against companies that stop supporting Huawei, a national champion and a top maker of telecom gear and smartphones.
In November, the Commerce Department said it started approving some applications for licenses to do business with Huawei, while rejecting others. It characterized the approvals as “narrow.”  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). got a license. It’s unclear which other companies got approved and how the decisions were made."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Avenatti pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to an indictment accusing him of trying to extort as much as $25 million from  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) by threatening to go public with claims the company made improper payments to athletes.
Clasping his hands behind his back, the celebrity lawyer, who gained fame representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against U.S. President Donald Trump, said ""not guilty"" after U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe read each of the three counts against him in Manhattan federal court.
Avenatti declined to comment after the hearing.
Prosecutors have accused Avenatti, 48, of demanding money from Nike in exchange for agreeing to scrap a threatened news conference to discuss the athletic wear company's alleged improper payments to elite college basketball recruits.
A trial is scheduled for Jan. 21, 2020, and could last the rest of January. Nike has denied wrongdoing.
Since his March 25 arrest in the Nike case, Avenatti has defended himself against a variety of criminal charges.
Avenatti has pleaded not guilty in Manhattan to stealing about $300,000 from Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, after helping her secure a book contract.
He has also pleaded not guilty in California to wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, including stealing from clients.
The amended Nike indictment dropped two conspiracy counts but added a charge of honest services fraud.
Prosecutors said Avenatti failed to reveal that Nike had offered to settle with his client, youth basketball coach Gary Franklin, so long as the Beaverton, Oregon-based company did not have to pay Avenatti himself.
At Tuesday's hearing, Avenatti's lawyer, Scott Srebnick, said that charge should be dismissed, citing a 2010 Supreme Court decision involving former Enron Corp Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling limiting the claim to bribery and kickback cases.
""The government's whole theory was that Avenatti was shaking down Nike,"" but its case has ""morphed"" into alleged bribery solicitation, Srebnick said. ""It's hard to know from this indictment exactly what this bribery scheme was.""
Gardephe did not rule on the motion.
The judge also said he was ""inclined"" to let an expert witness testify for the prosecution about legal ethics rules, though not whether Avenatti violated them.
Prospective jurors are expected to receive questionnaires in advance about the case.
""Given how much press there has been about Mr. Avenatti, it seems obvious to me that a questionnaire is necessary,"" he said.
The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-cr-00373."
1458,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 03:47PM ET</span>","Prices, Not Just Pledges, to Dictate China Buying, Adviser Says","(Bloomberg) -- At the end of the day, the competitiveness of American farm products will determine whether China buys them, according to a U.S. trade adviser.
While the Asian nation has pledged to buy $80 billion in U.S. agricultural products in the next two years as part of an initial trade accord, purchases probably will be attuned to market conditions, said Tom Kehoe, an adviser to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and and U.S. Trade Representative.
“These are business people,” Kehoe said Tuesday in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. “They are going to have to be in a competitive situation. Otherwise, they are not going to buy it.”
Kehoe’s comments underline the ongoing challenges for U.S. growers competing in crop markets with countries including Brazil and Argentina, whose currencies have weakened against the dollar. Announcing the phase-one trade deal Friday, China also stressed it has increased buying based on market conditions and following WTO rules, adding it will import agriculture products from the U.S. and other countries.
Sill, Beijing made detailed pledges on agriculture that would see it purchase at least an additional $16 billion annually in commodities on top of the pre-trade war level of $24 billion and endeavor to buy as much as $50 billion annually, according to USTR Robert Lighthizer.
Kehoe said specific quantities aren’t being announced because details may move market prices, and that would be “unfair.”
“There are safeguards built in” for both countries “to live up to what they’ve promised,” and those details will be released in the “next few days,” he said. “Pretty much all ag markets are involved: most of the grains, beans, pork, some seafood.”
China probably will meet the targets because the Dec. 15 tariffs won’t go in effect, and some of the 15% tariffs are being shifted to 7.5%, which involves billions of dollars in products facing lower levies, he said."
1459,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 03:20PM ET</span>",Boeing's 737 production halt could dent U.S. first-quarter GDP,"By Heather Timmons and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) decision to stop production of its best-selling 737 MAX aircraft involved in two fatal crashes will impact U.S. economic growth and employment, but the pain may be brief and concentrated in areas where suppliers are located, analysts and executives say. 
The biggest assembly-line halt in more than two decades at Boeing could cut first quarter 2020 gross domestic product growth by at least half a percentage point, economists estimated on Tuesday. The hit to GDP growth would come from a smaller inventory build. 
Boeing holds unique sway in the U.S. economy as the largest U.S. goods exporter and also as the largest weight in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), the blue chip stock index tracked worldwide as a bellwether of wealth creation.
The suspension of production comes as the manufacturing sector is starting to regain its footing after being pressured by a 17-month trade war between the United States and China, which has eroded business sentiment and helped to undercut capital expenditure. 
Since a global grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX in March that froze deliveries, the aircraft manufacturer continued production of the aircraft. The resulting surge in aircraft inventory offset the drag on GDP growth from reduced exports and business spending on equipment. 
""With deliveries of the plane already halted, exports and investment in aircraft are unlikely to fall much further,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""But the decision to stop producing means that the surge in inventories will end, resulting in a big drag on economic growth in the first quarter."" 
Economists do not anticipate an impact on growth for the full year as production of the plane is likely to resume sometime in 2020. They expected the Federal Reserve, which last week signaled interest rates could remain unchanged at least through 2020, would view any weakness in first-quarter growth as temporary, provided the production pause did not extend beyond the first half of next year.
""Once production is resumed, we expect to also see sizeable effects through the GDP accounts,"" said Robert Rosner, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. ""Investment and export data will likely be boosted considerably as aircraft are shipped out, while inventories should decline."" 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren expressed concern about Boeing's problems.
""Boeing does employ a lot of people and one of our major exports has been Boeing planes,"" he told Reuters. ""It's definitely not good news that Boeing is continuing to have difficulties getting their planes back up and running.""
Boeing has also had made a notable contribution to investors' wealth. While its share price has lost a quarter of its value since March, it remains one of the past decade's best-performing stocks, gaining more than 500%, roughly three times the gain for the entire Dow. 
Its total market value has risen by nearly $145 billion in 10 years, and it has shelled out another $62 billion to its investors in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.
RIPPLE EFFECTS 
The effects of the production halt are likely to ripple through other sectors of the economy. Boeing has not said how long production will be frozen but the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, a union representing Boeing and its suppliers' workers, said: ""The company expects the shutdown to be measured in weeks, not days.""
Though Boeing has said it would not lay off any of the roughly 12,000 employees who make the 737, economists expect some of the more than 600 smaller companies in the supply chain to lay off or furlough employees, or cut their hours. These developments would impact on U.S. employment data. 
Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR), for example, already cut contractors and temporarily reduced the work week for employees to 32 hours in June. They went back to full-time employment in September. 
Boeing is Spirit's biggest customer. It makes an estimated 70% of the 737's parts and employs 17,000 people around the world, including more than 10,000 in Wichita, where it is the biggest employer in a city of about 390,000 residents with a 3.1% unemployment rate.

Seattle, where the bulk of Boeing's employee base is located, has an 3.3% unemployment rate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) needs to improve its oversight to address maintenance issues at Allegiant Air, the 11th largest U.S. carrier, according to a report seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
The U.S. Transportation Department's Inspector General, in a 31-page report sent to Capitol Hill on Tuesday but not yet made public, said FAA inspectors since 2011 have not ""consistently documented risks associated with 36 Allegiant Air in-flight engine shutdowns for its MD-80 fleet or correctly assessed the root cause of maintenance issues.""
Ultra-low cost Allegiant, a unit of Allegiant Travel Co, said it had not yet see the report and did not have an immediate comment.
The FAA said in a letter attached to the report that it agreed with eight of the nine recommendations made by the inspector general and partially agreed with the remaining one.
Allegiant carried about 14 million passengers last year, serving 122 U.S. cities and Puerto Rico on 450 flight routes.
The inspector general opened the probe in May 2018 after a ""series of in-flight engine shutdowns, aborted takeoffs, and unscheduled landings"" raised concerns about maintenance practices.
The report said in-flight shutdowns at Allegiant ""continued until July 2018 and were only resolved four months later when Allegiant Air retired the last of its MD-80 fleet."" Allegiant now flies an all Airbus fleet.
The report found in-flight engine shutdowns forced 21 Allegiant aircraft to return or divert to other airports between 2014 and 2018, but that regulators did not properly track engine shutdown risks.
A 2015 maintenance provider failure at Allegiant Air demonstrated ""severe violations that represent unacceptable safety risks or could result in catastrophic outcomes should also warrant a more stringent oversight approach,"" the report said.
The inspector general said the airline's maintenance provider failed to insert a cotter pin on a critical flight control component that put some 30,000 passengers at risk.
The report said in August 2015, a pilot ""almost lost control of this aircraft during takeoff when it unexpectedly tried to lift off prematurely"" but was able to abort takeoff and land safely.
After inspectors proposed a 30-day suspension for Allegiant Air's maintenance provider, FAA regional officials reduced the suspension to a compliance action. FAA inspectors closed out six of eight compliance actions before ensuring Allegiant Air actually took any corrective actions, the report found.
It also found that FAA does not provide inspectors with guidance and comprehensive training to ensure Allegiant Air takes appropriate corrective actions.

The FAA said it had ""initiated compliance actions at Allegiant Air that have improved safety for the flying public.""

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 02:48PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Daimler seeks majority control of its main China joint venture,"By Julie Zhu, Edward Taylor and Yilei Sun
HONG KONG/FRANKFURT/BEIJING (Reuters) -  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) is seeking to buy a majority stake in its Chinese operations, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters, after initial efforts to raise its stake failed and as Chinese investors tighten their grip on the German carmaker.
Daimler's moves come at a time of heightened tension between Berlin and Beijing as German lawmakers debate whether to bar China's Huawei from local 5G networks and as German companies look to ease Chinese ownership restrictions.
Daimler has been exploring several options to strengthen its control of Beijing Benz Automotive Co, its Chinese joint venture with BAIC Group, including a plan to raise its stake to 75% from the current 49%, two of the people familiar with the matter said.
Daimler faces some opposition within BAIC as the Chinese partner wants to maintain control of the highly profitable business that has benefited from strong sales of Mercedes-Benz cars and helped it fund expansion into other activities, sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters.
Daimler, which owns the Mercedes-Benz brand, declined to comment on its China expansion plans. BAIC did not respond to requests for comment.
CASH COW
Daimler's cash cow joint venture with BAIC is the main profit contributor of BAIC Group's Hong Kong listed company  BAIC Motor Corp Ltd  (HK:1958), which also has assets of BAIC's own brand cars and its joint venture with South Korea's carmaker  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380).
In 2018, BAIC Motor reported 37.01 billion yuan ($5.26 billion) gross profit while that of Beijing Benz Automotive contributed 40.52 billion yuan, excluding the profit from the China JV, BAIC Motor was loss-making last year.
Beijing Benz Automotive, which started building and selling locally made vehicles in 2006, sold around 485,000 units last year, accounting for more than 70% of Mercedes-Benz's China sales. 
In China, the world's biggest auto market, 525,890 Mercedes-Benz cars were sold in the first nine months this year, up 5% from a year earlier even as the total market keeps declining. Its German rival Audi sold 491,040 units and Munich-based BMW (DE:BMWG) sold 526,017 BMW and Mini-branded cars over the same period in China.
Daimler's stake purchase ambitions come as BAIC is pursuing a separate deal to buy a 10% stake in the German carmaker, sources told Reuters, to upstage Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, which owns a 9.69% Daimler stake. 
If BAIC clinches a 10% shareholding, Chinese companies will control just under 20% of the luxury carmaker, enough to block significant decisions at Daimler's shareholder meeting, such as nominating directors or approving major investments.
These key decisions need at least 75% of votes cast at an annual general meeting, giving any shareholder with a 20% stake a blocking minority. At Daimler's 2019 annual general meeting, only 52.91% of the company's share capital was represented.
Daimler held talks with BAIC in 2018 about increasing its ownership of the China joint venture, but the talks petered out, prompting Daimler's management to ask Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to explore ways to increase its 9.55% stake in BAIC Motor.
In 2018 Beijing started easing foreign ownership rules, allowing German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) to buy a 75% stake in its joint venture with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd (HK:1114) by 2022, when foreign firms will be permitted to control a non-electric passenger car company in China, prompting Daimler to pursue similar ambitions.
CHINESE INFLUENCE
Daimler has urged the German government to press Beijing to ease ownership restrictions to ensure a ""level playing field,"" just as China's ambassador to Germany warned Berlin not to block China's Huawei from supplying German telecoms equipment. 
The United States, which is embroiled in a global trade dispute with China, has urged German chancellor Angela Merkel to exclude Huawei from mobile equipment auctions on security grounds.
Huawei says it is an independent company and dismisses such concerns as baseless attempts by the United States to damage its business and reputation.
Last week China's ambassador to Germany, Ken Wu said Beijing could retaliate if Huawei was excluded from Germany's 5G rollout.
""If Germany were to take a decision in the end that would exclude Huawei from the German market, then it should expect consequences,"" the Chinese ambassador said at an event hosted by German business daily Handelsblatt.
""The Chinese government will not just stand by and watch. Look, 28 million cars were sold on the Chinese market last year, including seven million German cars. Could we say too one day that German cars are not safe – because we are capable of producing our own cars? No, this is pure protectionism.""

LONDON (Reuters) - As a phenomenal year for bond markets draws to a close, investors in Germany, the euro zone's benchmark bond issuer, are set to reap their best returns in five years.
Those who bought 10-year German government bonds at the start of 2019 are looking at a return of almost 6%, which would mark the best returns since 2014, according to Refinitiv data.
(GRAPHIC: Returns on 10-year German Bunds - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/10091/10002/Bund1712.png)
That performance reflects a year where a bitter trade war, recession fears and a major shift in central bank policy toward easing boosted demand for safe-haven sovereign debt.
As those risks unwind, triple-A rated German bonds are not expected to do as well in 2020. Brexit and trade war uncertainties have ebbed for now. Rate cuts and stimulus from the likes of the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have eased recession fears.
""Bunds will return less in terms of capital appreciation next year after a stellar 2019,"" said Ross Hutchison, fixed-income fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""There are plenty of positive forces out there for Bunds: anemic European inflation, the net negative supply thanks to ECB QE (quantitative easing). But the low (yield) levels we're already seeing, a growing sense of monetary policy fatigue, and the looming threat of fiscal expansion all act as brakes on how much we will likely rally from here.""
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute said last week it was underweight European government bonds. Citi's euro zone economic surprise index is at its most positive level since early 2018, suggesting the gloom is lifting .
(GRAPHIC: Global bond market returns this year - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/10092/10003/Bundglobalreturns1712.png)
German bond returns, at least on 10-year debt, are slightly below those of positive-yielding U.S. peers this year. Still, Bund performance looks remarkable for a market repeatedly written off for being too expensive and offering little value after massive ECB stimulus in recent years pushed borrowing costs down sharply.
Even after recent selling, 10-year German yields are down 55 basis points this year at -0.28% (DE10YT=RR) -- set for their biggest annual fall since 2014.
""Bund returns are over 10% in total return terms and are ahead of what most people assumed,"" said Joseph Little, chief global strategist at HSBC Global Asset Management.
At the height of the bond rally in early September, the entire German yield curve was below 0% and Bund yields had dropped to -0.74%. At the end of last year, the 12-month forecast for Bund yields was 0.90%, according to a Reuters poll of analysts.
""The bond rally this year highlights how wrong the consensus was that core euro zone would underperform in the wake of the end of QE,"" said Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy at Rabobank.
The ECB ended asset purchases at the end of 2018, but in September said they would resume, given the weak economy.
Today, year-end 2020 forecasts vary widely, highlighting the breadth of views on the economic outlook.
""This partly reflects the fact that the strong returns of 2019 have been a big surprise for many investors. At this point, prospective long run returns look poor for Bunds,"" said HSBC's Little.

The latest recall follows one for faulty tumble dryers in July, which also posed a fire risk.
Whirlpool will start a recall and replacement program for the washing machines next month, the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) said on Tuesday.
The recall will be undertaken by Whirlpool UK Appliances Ltd, which identified a fault in some Hotpoint and Indesit models sold since 2014.
According to OPSS's advice, there is a risk that the door locks of affected machines could catch fire due to overheating during the washing process. It said affected consumers are advised to unplug their machines and register with Whirlpool for a no-cost replacement.
""The Office for Product Safety and Standards will closely monitor Whirlpool to ensure the recall is carried out successfully,"" said OPSS Chief Executive Graham Russell.
""Our priority is to keep consumers safe and we urge affected customers to unplug their washing machines, contact Whirlpool and follow its advice.""
Jeff Noel, vice president of Whirlpool, apologized for the recall.
""We know this will cause some concern. We especially understand that the washing machine is so important to family life, and in Christmas holiday season it will be even more of an important matter and, for that, we apologize,"" he told the BBC."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Tuesday it is upgrading an investigation into 1.7 million General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) vehicles for windshield wiper failures.
The auto safety agency opened the probe in November 2018 to see if GM needed to expand a 2016 recall of 2013 model year Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain SUVs to cover additional vehicles. 
The engineering analysis probe covers 2010-2012 and 2014-2016 Equinox and Terrain vehicles. NHTSA could demand a recall after it completes the probe. 
NHTSA said it has reviewed 1,900 complaints and reports related to the issue in the 1.7 million vehicles.
NHTSA said it has seen elevated failure rates in the 1.7 million vehicles, even though GM said the recalled vehicles have ""double the warranty rate and five times the complaint rate.""
GM said it ""fully cooperate to support their investigation. We do not believe these windshield washer systems are defective.""
The wiper failures that prompted the 2016 recall were attributed to water and debris intrusion into the windshield wiper assembly ball joints, leading to excessive wear and eventual detachment of the ball joint.""
GM said it was installing an improved windshield wiper motor and transmission assembly and relocating a drain hole at the base of the windshield.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>","Boeing, suppliers slip as Wall Street counts MAX halt costs","By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Shares of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and its global suppliers fell further on Tuesday as analysts began to tally the cost of the U.S. planemaker's decision to suspend production of 737 MAX jets in January, its biggest assembly-line halt in more than two decades.
Analysts estimated Boeing could continue to burn around $1 billion a month despite the halt in work on what was previously its best-selling plane, and investors worried layoffs, lost work and logistical costs would ripple through its supply chain.
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months, costing the manufacturer more than $9 billion so far.
""Each supplier will likely be missing about 200 deliveries versus original plans, with about 80% of the shortfall coming in 2020 and the remainder in 2021,"" Melius Research analyst Carter Copeland wrote in a note.
Britain's Senior Plc (L:SNR), which makes parts including airframes and engine build-up tubes for the MAX, was one of the first suppliers to comment on the suspension, saying it was working closely with the U.S. planemaker to assess the impact of a production shutdown on its 2020 sales.
The fallout extended to carriers, with Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) extending cancellations of MAX flights by another five weeks through April 13, due to the continued uncertainty around the timing of the aircraft's return to service.
The U.S. planemaker's shares fell more than 1% in early trading, while its top supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR), slumped nearly 3% to $75.65.
Analysts say the U.S.-based Spirit, which makes the MAX's fuselage, draws more than 50% of its annual sales from the plane.
""We assume (Spirit) will elect to stop production and furlough employees at a cost of $0.40 (per share) per month of the stoppage,"" Copeland said. 
Spirit said it was working with Boeing to determine the financial implication of the production halt.
""We believe the suspension will likely last a minimum of 3-6 months but would not be surprised if it lasted longer,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Michael Ciarmoli.
Shares of Senior, whose aerospace unit counts Boeing as its biggest customer with 15% of the division's sales, fell more than 10%. Those in France's  Safran  SA (PA:SAF), which makes engines for the MAX in a joint venture with  General Electric  Co (N:GE), dipped 1.5%.
Safran has warned that if the aircraft's grounding lasts until the end of the year, its cash conversion could dip below its targeted 50-55% range of recurring operating income.
Unlike most suppliers, it is paid mostly once the airplanes are delivered to the buyer.
GE has estimated the MAX grounding would reduce its cash flow by $1.4 billion in 2019. Its shares were down marginally at $11.16.
Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said there will be ""some step-down in production across the supply chain"", but he believes that Boeing will continue to absorb much of the financial impact and will keep its supply chain relatively supported.
United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), which makes landing systems, avionics and interior lighting for the MAX, and  Arconic Inc  (N:ARNC) that supplies aluminum sheet and plate for the airplane dipped about 1%.
Shares of other suppliers such as wing flaps maker  Ducommun Inc  (N:DCO), composite materials supplier  Hexcel Corp  (N:HXL), and aircraft exterior lighting provider  Astronics Corp  (N:ATRO) were down 0.5% to 4%. The three companies get about 10% to 15% of their annual sales from Boeing, according to analysts.

Other smaller suppliers, including  Melrose  Industries (L:MRON), whose GKN (LON:GKN) business has a contract to supply windows for the passenger cabin of the 737 MAX, and  Meggitt  (L:MGGT), which makes parts including fire protection system for the MAX engine and auxiliary power unit, fell more than 1% in Europe.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 01:41PM ET</span>",Addictive nicotine in Juul nearly identical to a Marlboro: study,"By Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - The nicotine formula used by controversial e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc is nearly identical to the flavor and addictive profile of  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc's highly successful Marlboro cigarette brand, new research suggests.
A study released on Tuesday from researchers at Portland State University in Oregon helps to explain why a growing number of young people who never smoked cigarettes have become regular users of Juul vaping devices.
The formulation of Juul's nicotine aerosol was designed to make it far easier for users to inhale larger quantities of nicotine without gagging, gasping or coughing - or even noticing.
""It becomes obvious why novice users, people who've never smoked before, find it easy to try Juul,"" said David Peyton, a professor of chemistry at Portland State University who worked on the study, published in the journal Tobacco Control. ""And once you try it, you're getting dosed with a high concentration of nicotine.""
Directly comparing Juul vaping devices to Marlboro cigarettes, the researchers analyzed the amount and chemical makeup of the nicotine in Juul's cartridge-like disposable ""pods.""
In addition to sweet flavors and its sleek, flash drive-like design, Juul is notable for popularizing what are known as ""nicotine salts,"" a smoother form of nicotine than what was contained in earlier e-cigarettes, according to Juul's own patents and outside research on their formula.
By adding organic acids to liquid nicotine, San Francisco-based Juul was able to reduce the amount of ""freebase nicotine"" in the aerosol that users inhale.
Freebase nicotine, common in e-cigarette liquid prior to Juul's arrival in 2015, is harsh and difficult to inhale at high concentrations. Juul virtually eliminated the harsh side effects.
'ALL THE THINGS ABOUT MARLBORO THAT ARE ADDICTIVE'
While e-cigarettes have been marketed as a means to help smokers quit or cut down, public health officials have expressed concern that they are drawing a new, younger generation into nicotine addiction. Juul has come under intense scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers and attorneys general over the surging popularity of its products among teenagers in recent years.
A recent study found that nearly 60% of high schoolers and 54% of middle schoolers who use nicotine vaping products said Juul was their usual brand.
Peyton and fellow researchers James Pankow and Anna Duell measured the amounts of nicotine in Juul and how much of that nicotine was in the harsher freebase form of the chemical.
They determined that Juul's potency and flavor profile was almost exactly the same as Marlboro cigarettes, describing Juul as an ""e-cigarette analog"" of the U.S. market-leading brand.
""Juul is all the things about Marlboro that are addictive,"" said Pankow, an expert in the chemistry of nicotine and tobacco smoke. ""Then they take away the bad smell and add some flavors. It's a much more pleasant experience.""
Under pressure from regulators and lawmakers, Juul in recent months stopped selling flavors other than menthol and tobacco in the United States, but continues to sell fruit and dessert flavors in other countries.
A study released last month by researchers at Pennsylvania State University found that Juul delivered more nicotine to the bloodstream, and at a faster rate, than earlier e-cigarettes, and that its nicotine boost was similar to that of a cigarette.
Juul Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new study's findings.
In an earlier statement, the company said its products were designed to get adult smokers to switch from cigarettes. Therefore the company ""sought to create a nicotine-based e-liquid that mimicked the nicotine experience"" in cigarettes, according to the statement.
""Providing a similar nicotine experience was a priority given the fact that early generation e-cigarettes had failed in this respect and, as a result, did not convert a significant number of adult smokers from cigarettes,"" the company said.
Juul cited studies it commissioned showing that between 30% to 50% of adult smokers who use Juul ""switch completely from smoking cigarettes within six months.""
A separate U.S. study released on Monday found that e-cigarette use significantly increases the risk of developing chronic lung conditions such as asthma or emphysema.
The Portland State researchers noted that Juul had rapidly duplicated - and improved - a formula that tobacco growers and purveyors took centuries to perfect: A way to deliver potent amounts of nicotine through inhalation.
The tobacco industry for centuries tinkered with the chemistry of nicotine in tobacco through various drying techniques and additives, aiming to make burned tobacco smoother to inhale, the researchers noted.
They said Juul's evolution from earlier e-cigarettes was reminiscent of the tobacco industry's cigarette development.
Juul has ""essentially duplicated the world's most popular cigarettes, which means this should be attractive to cigarette users,"" Peyton said. ""This is probably also a good way to get the curious novice who has never smoked.
""It's difficult to go for the one population without hitting the second."""
1467,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 01:37PM ET</span>",Dow heavyweight Boeing ending strong decade with whimper,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dow stalwart Boeing Co's (N:BA) shares have nearly erased their gains for 2019 as the plane maker grapples with the fallout from its sidelined 737 MAX jetliner.
Boeing shares fell as much as 2% on Tuesday after the company said it would suspend production of its best-selling 737 MAX in January, in the latest repercussions from two fatal crashes of the now-grounded aircraft.
The initial decline put the stock in slightly negative territory for 2019, but it was back to slightly positive for the year after rebounding during the session. That's still a huge underperformance compared to the S&P 500's 27% rise so far in 2019.
The stock has a particularly large influence on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), as it carries the most weight of the 30 stocks that make up the index. The Dow has underperformed the S&P this year, rising 21%.
Boeing shares have slid some 26% since hitting an all-time high of $446.01 on March 1. Boeing and shares of key suppliers such as Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR) have underperformed the S&P 500 (SPX) since an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crashed on March 10, the same Boeing model that crashed in Indonesia in October.

Even with the lackluster performance of Boeing shares so far in 2019, the stock has had a strong decade.
Of the stocks currently in the 30-member Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), Boeing has rung up the fifth highest total return since 2010 began, rising over 658% during that time through Monday. UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) tallied the highest returns in the Dow, rising 1,009% and 968%, respectively.

Because of Boeing's relatively high stock price, the stock has a particularly strong influence on the blue-chip Dow, which is weighted by stock prices, as opposed to the S&P 500, for which the companies with the largest market value carry the most sway.
Despite its recent swoon to $329, Boeing shares carry the highest price in the Dow. As of Monday, Boeing's weight was about 7.9% of the index, followed by UnitedHealth with a weight of 7%. By contrast, Boeing's weight on the S&P 500 was only 0.66%, compared to about 4.5% for Apple.
Since the decade began, Boeing has contributed more points than any other component to the Dow's gain, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Over that time, Boeing accounted for 1,907.4 of the total 17,808 points gained by the Dow, or about 10.7% of the rise, according to Bespoke.
Despite the stock's recent swoon, Boeing remains the biggest industrial company by market value in the S&P 500. Its $184 billion in market cap as of Monday was at least $55 billion above the next biggest industrial sector companies, United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) and Honeywell International Inc (N:HON).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States may not have had a woman president quite yet, but on TV it certainly has. One of those was Mellie Grant, the character played by Bellamy Young on the Shonda Rhimes hit “Scandal” before it ended last year.
Now one of the stars of the Fox show “Prodigal Son,” Young spoke with Reuters about making it in Hollywood.
Q: People might not know this, but you are a big numbers person who studied physics at Yale?
A: I grew up in Asheville, North Carolina, and my dad was actually a tax man, an auditor for the state. I vividly remember him with his adding machines, writing stuff down, and my happy place was beside him. I got my love of numbers from him, from a very early age. He was always very clear about what comes in, and what goes out, and how to stay in the black.
Q: What was your first job when you were a young actress starting out?
A: My first office job, after I moved to New York City, wasn’t so successful. It was on Pearl Street, near Wall Street; they moved me around different parts of the office for a week, and I had no discernible skills at all, so they sent me on my way.
Q: What did you learn about money, during those lean early years of acting?
A: I was lucky enough to be booking enough jobs, so the main challenge was to keep the nut low and to have a long-term view. If you are determined and pragmatic, you can get by. Of course I couldn’t afford much of anything at the time. I remember I lived with a bunch of people, and I had a bike lock on the door to my room.
Q: Once you got your big break, how did you handle financial success?
A: I have a wonderful business manager, who I love talking with, and learning from, and making decisions under her tutelage. But I have always been a girl who loves to balance her checkbook. I love to know what’s coming in and what’s going out; that still lives inside of me.
As an actor, I have had intermittent employment for my whole life, so you have to be very aware that now is not forever. As I get older there are financial things to consider, so you have to have a macro plan in place, hopefully without sacrificing joy.
Q: What philanthropic causes do you help support?
A: Back in the day, I was a big scholarship kid because of financial need. So when I was graduating from college, I got a note from the school’s bursar, saying: ‘Here’s the name of the person who put you through college – maybe write him a thank-you note.’ His name was Richard Light. I got to meet him at the age of 93, before he passed away.
I got to thinking, ‘What must that feel like, to put people through college?’ So now I have established a scholarship at Yale.
Q: Looking down the road, have you thought about what your own retirement is going to look like?
A: For an actor, not having a job is the most stressful thing of all. So work is my vacation. When I get a job, my shoulders drop three inches and I’m ready to go; I don’t get tired. I can’t imagine life without work, so retirement is a four-letter word for me.
Q: What life lessons do you want to pass along to the next generation?
A: Love is the most important thing. Be kind. Be wise. And don’t believe all the noise out there – truth comes from your heart."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped 3.4% on Tuesday after the streaming heavyweight unveiled historical data showing strong overseas growth, while Roku dropped 1.5% after saying its well-respected chief financial officer would step down.
Netflix provided historical details about its international business ahead of its Jan. 21 quarterly report, which will disclose revenue and membership by region for the first time.
Shares of the video streaming service have surged over 3,800% since the start of 2010, easily making Netflix the decade's top-performing stock on Wall Street. But the stock has fallen 25% from its record high in July 2018 as the Los Gatos, California company has wrestled with ballooning production costs, competition from media giant Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and questions about its pace of user growth.
Roku, which along with Netflix has benefited from consumers' abandonment of traditional cable television, dipped by about $2 after the company late on Monday announced the resignation of Chief Financial Officer Steve Louden, who shepherded the company through its successful 2017 initial public offer.
Roku, which said Louden would stay on until a successor is found, has seen its stock gain 351% so far in 2019, and is up 874% since from its IPO price, leading  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) this month to warn of ""exuberance"" around video streaming stocks.
Netflix's filing late on Monday showed that in the Asia-Pacific region - the company's smallest - membership grew 148% from the end of the third quarter of 2017 to the end of the third quarter of 2019. Membership in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased 132% during the same period, while membership in Latin America grew 61%.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their Social Democrat partners have delayed until next year a decision on security rules for Germany's 5G network that could bar China's Huawei, a highly divisive issue in an unhappy alliance.
Merkel's right-left government, under pressure from the United States to bar Huawei, wants to toughen up technical certification and scrutiny of telecoms equipment suppliers, without excluding any specific country or vendor.
Social Democrat (SPD) lawmakers on Tuesday backed an internal proposal that, if adopted by the government, could effectively translate into shutting out Huawei. Lawmakers said their goal was nevertheless to reach a common position with Merkel's CDU/CSU group.
""I think we will have a solution in January,"" said SPD lawmaker Jens Zimmermann. ""We will have a common blueprint and it will be considerably more severe.""
He was referring to rules for the build-out of 5G mobile networks finalised by Merkel's government in October that foresaw an evaluation of technical and other criteria and was largely interpreted as keeping the door open to Huawei.
Merkel's conservatives are divided on the issue. Hawks opposed to the chancellor's careful approach are eager to go ahead with the SPD's strict standards, which stipulate that suppliers from countries without ""constitutional supervision"" should be excluded.
Moderates eager to avoid a showdown with Merkel suggested that the stringent security criteria should apply to the core network only.
A paper prepared by moderate conservatives also stipulates that no single company should become dominant by supplying more than 50 percent of the 5G network components. The rules would be stricter for non-EU suppliers.

DELAY FEARED
German operators are all customers of Huawei and have warned that banning the Chinese vendor would add years of delays and billions of dollars in costs to launching 5G networks.
""There is no agreement in the CDU parliamentary faction on the Huawei paper,"" said Thorsten Frei, deputy leader of the CDU/CSU group in parliament.
""The faction will have a position in the new year. Then there will be talks with our SPD coalition partners on a common position.""
One of the main bones of contention is whether the strict rules should just apply to the core 5G network or also include peripheral parts.
The SPD and conservative hawks want the condition of ""constitutional supervision"" to apply for suppliers of parts for both the core and peripheral network.
The United States says gear provided by Huawei, the leading telecoms equipment vendor with a global market share of 28 percent, contains 'back doors' that would enable China to spy on other countries.
Shenzhen-based Huawei has denied the allegations by the Trump administration, which imposed export controls on Huawei in May, hobbling its smartphone business and raising questions over whether the Chinese company can maintain its market lead."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and its Omnicare unit were sued on Tuesday by the U.S. government, which accused them of fraudulently billing Medicare and other programs for drugs for older and disabled people without valid prescriptions.
The Department of Justice joined whistleblower litigation accusing Omnicare of violating the federal False Claims Act for illegally dispensing drugs to tens of thousands of patients in assisted living facilities, group homes for people with special needs, and other long-term care facilities.
According to a civil complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Omnicare would often assign new numbers to prescriptions after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.
The government said this enabled Omnicare to bill Medicare Medicaid, and Tricare, which serves military personnel, for hundreds of thousands of drugs, under what the company internally called ""rollover"" prescriptions, from 2010 to 2018.
Many of the drugs were anticonvulsants, antidepressants and antipsychotics and treated serious conditions such as dementia, depression and heart disease, and sometimes had dangerous side effects requiring supervision by doctors, the government said.
""A pharmacy's fundamental obligation is to ensure that drugs are dispensed only under the supervision of treating doctors who monitor patients' drug therapies,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said in a statement.
""Omnicare put at risk the health of tens of thousands of elderly and disabled individuals living in assisted living and other residential long-term care facilities,"" he added.
The lawsuit seeks civil penalties and other damages.
CVS, one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains and pharmacy benefit managers, said it did not believe the claims had merit, and that it intended to defend itself in court.
""We are confident that Omnicare's dispensing practices will be found to be consistent with state requirements and industry-accepted practices,"" the company said in a statement.
CVS, based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, bought Omnicare in 2015 for about $10.4 billion.
The government joined a lawsuit originally brought in June 2015 by Uri Bassan, a pharmacist who worked for Omnicare in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
It said Omnicare's compliance department had acknowledged the dispensing problem internally two months earlier, when a regional officer expressed concern in an email that its systems allowed rollover prescriptions ""without any documentation or pharmacist intervention.""
The False Claims Act lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the federal government, and share in recoveries.
Twenty-nine U.S. states and the District of Columbia are also named as plaintiffs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thirteen prominent banks and financial services companies agreed to pay $337 million to resolve claims by investors that they conspired to rig prices of bonds issued by mortgage companies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC) for a decade.
The preliminary settlements, filed late Monday night in federal court in Manhattan, require a judge's approval and would conclude private nationwide antitrust litigation brought against 16 defendants, with settlements totaling $386.5 million.
 Barclays  (L:BARC), which underwrote the most Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds, will pay $87 million.
Bank of America (N:BAC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Cantor Fitzgerald,  Citigroup  (N:C),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), HSBC (L:HSBA), JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Nomura (T:8604),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), Toronto-Dominion (TO:TD) and UBS (S:UBSG) will separately pay a combined $250 million.
The banks denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and units of Tennessee's First Horizon (N:FHN) previously settled for a combined $49.5 million. 
Investors including Pennsylvania Treasurer Joe Torsella had accused the defendants of exploiting their market dominance to overcharge for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds from Jan. 1, 2009, to Jan. 1, 2019, and keep more profit for themselves.
The civil case began after a published report said the U.S. Department of Justice had opened a criminal price-fixing probe related to the bonds.
According to an amended complaint, the 16 defendants underwrote $3.97 trillion, or 77.2%, of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds from Jan. 1, 2009, to Jan. 1, 2016.
A spokeswoman for Barclays declined to comment on Tuesday.
In a statement, Torsella said the settlement also calls for strong oversight and compliance programs, to help ensure that the alleged misconduct ""is not only corrected, but that it is prevented.""
The Manhattan court is home to an array of private litigation accusing banks of conspiring to move various bond, commodity and currency markets.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee more than half of U.S. mortgages.
The so-called government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, have been in conservatorships established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency since taxpayers bailed them out in September 2008, with profits swept to the U.S. Treasury.
On Sept. 5, the White House announced a plan to return Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the private sector. FHFA Director Mark Calabria has said he hopes to complete the process by 2024.

1478,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 11:46AM ET</span>",EU Warns of Brexit Cliff as U.K. Excludes Longer Transition,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to stick to a 2020 Brexit transition period revives the risk of the country’s ties to the European Union being severed disruptively, according to the bloc’s chief civil servant for trade policy.
Sabine Weyand, director general for trade in the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, cautioned that Johnson’s intention to prevent any prolongation of the Brexit transition period beyond 2020 would require the bloc to plan accordingly.
“We are well advised to take seriously that the U.K. does not intend to go for an extension of the transition,” Weyand told a European Policy Centre conference on Tuesday in Brussels. “We need to be prepared for that. And that means that, in the negotiations, we have to look at those issues where failing to reach an agreement by the end of 2020 would lead to another cliff-edge situation.”
The U.K. is on course to leave the EU by Jan. 31 after Johnson scored an overwhelming victory in national elections last week on a pledge to “get Brexit done.”
U.K. parliamentary approval of a hard-fought withdrawal agreement between Britain and its 27 EU partners would trigger a transition phase until the end of 2020. During this period, the economic status quo would be maintained while both sides negotiate on their future trade, political, security and other relations.
Under the Brexit deal, which Weyand helped craft in her previous commission position, the transition phase could be prolonged by as long as two years. Such a decision would have to be taken by mid-2020.
While the EU has said its ties to post-Brexit Britain should prevent any tariffs and quotas from emerging, top officials in the bloc have indicated that the timetable for wrapping up negotiations with the U.K. by end-2020 is too tight.
EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan signaled on Dec. 6 that the bloc and post-Brexit Britain would struggle to reach a free-trade accord by the end of 2020. And on Tuesday German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a closed-door gathering of her Christian Democratic parliamentary allies in Berlin that Johnson’s goal of completing negotiations next year is “very ambitious,” according to a party official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
EU officials have also stressed the need for post-Brexit Britain to avoid undercutting the bloc’s rules promoting social and environmental protection and limiting subsidies to companies.
“We will wait and hear from the U.K. how they want to handle that,” Weyand said. “The ambition for duty-free, quota-free trade under a free-trade agreement has to come accompanied by a level playing field.”

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 11:34AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Daimler seeks majority control of its main China joint venture - sources,"By Julie Zhu, Edward Taylor and Yilei Sun
HONG KONG/FRANKFURT/BEIJING (Reuters) -  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) is seeking to buy a majority stake in its Chinese operations, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters, after initial efforts to raise its stake failed and as Chinese investors tighten their grip on the German carmaker.
Daimler's moves come at a time of heightened tension between Berlin and Beijing as German lawmakers debate whether to bar China's Huawei from local 5G networks and as German companies look to ease Chinese ownership restrictions.
Daimler has been exploring several options to strengthen its control of Beijing Benz Automotive Co, its Chinese joint venture with BAIC Group, including a plan to raise its stake to 75% from the current 49%, two of the people familiar with the matter said.
Daimler faces some opposition within BAIC as the Chinese partner wants to maintain control of the highly profitable business that has benefited from strong sales of Mercedes-Benz cars and helped it fund expansion into other activities, sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters.
Daimler, which owns the Mercedes-Benz brand, declined to comment on its China expansion plans. BAIC did not respond to requests for comment.
CASH COW
Daimler's cash cow joint venture with BAIC is the main profit contributor of BAIC Group's Hong Kong listed company  BAIC Motor Corp Ltd  (HK:1958), which also has assets of BAIC's own brand cars and its joint venture with South Korea's carmaker  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380).
In 2018, BAIC Motor reported 37.01 billion yuan (4.1 billion pounds) gross profit while that of Beijing Benz Automotive contributed 40.52 billion yuan, excluding the profit from the China JV, BAIC Motor was loss-making last year.
Beijing Benz Automotive, which started building and selling locally made vehicles in 2006, sold around 485,000 units last year, accounting for more than 70% of Mercedes-Benz's China sales.
In China, the world's biggest auto market, 525,890 Mercedes-Benz cars were sold in the first nine months this year, up 5% from a year earlier even as the total market keeps declining. Its German rival Audi sold 491,040 units and Munich-based BMW (DE:BMWG) sold 526,017 BMW and Mini-branded cars over the same period in China.
Daimler's stake purchase ambitions come as BAIC is pursuing a separate deal to buy a 10% stake in the German carmaker, sources told Reuters, to upstage Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, which owns a 9.69% Daimler stake.
If BAIC clinches a 10% shareholding, Chinese companies will control just under 20% of the luxury carmaker, enough to block significant decisions at Daimler's shareholder meeting, such as nominating directors or approving major investments.
These key decisions need at least 75% of votes cast at an annual general meeting, giving any shareholder with a 20% stake a blocking minority. At Daimler's 2019 annual general meeting, only 52.91% of the company's share capital was represented.
Daimler held talks with BAIC in 2018 about increasing its ownership of the China joint venture, but the talks petered out, prompting Daimler's management to ask Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to explore ways to increase its 9.55% stake in BAIC Motor.
In 2018 Beijing started easing foreign ownership rules, allowing German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) to buy a 75% stake in its joint venture with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd (HK:1114) by 2022, when foreign firms will be permitted to control a non-electric passenger car company in China, prompting Daimler to pursue similar ambitions.
CHINESE INFLUENCE
Daimler has urged the German government to press Beijing to ease ownership restrictions to ensure a ""level playing field,"" just as China's ambassador to Germany warned Berlin not to block China's Huawei from supplying German telecoms equipment.
The United States, which is embroiled in a global trade dispute with China, has urged German chancellor Angela Merkel to exclude Huawei from mobile equipment auctions on security grounds.
Huawei says it is an independent company and dismisses such concerns as baseless attempts by the United States to damage its business and reputation.
Last week China's ambassador to Germany, Ken Wu said Beijing could retaliate if Huawei was excluded from Germany's 5G rollout.
""If Germany were to take a decision in the end that would exclude Huawei from the German market, then it should expect consequences,"" the Chinese ambassador said at an event hosted by German business daily Handelsblatt.
""The Chinese government will not just stand by and watch. Look, 28 million cars were sold on the Chinese market last year, including seven million German cars. Could we say too one day that German cars are not safe – because we are capable of producing our own cars? No, this is pure protectionism."""

""The work at Amazon is tough, particularly at Christmas time, and the pressure is extremely high. Employees pay the price for Amazon's fast delivery promise to its customers,"" Verdi said.

1484,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 09:43AM ET</span>",Boeing’s 737 Halt Likely to Cause Temporary Dent in U.S. GDP,"(Bloomberg) --   Boeing Co  .'s (NYSE:BA) production halt for the 737 Max is likely to be little more than a temporary headwind for the U.S. economy -- especially now that the expansion is on firmer footing compared with other times since the aircraft was grounded in early 2019.
The company’s decision to temporarily suspend production starting next month comes as the world’s largest economy has shaken off resurgent recession fears in recent months. Growth projections are stable, if unspectacular, after global risks eased on trade tensions and Brexit and the Federal Reserve moved to buttress growth with three interest-rate cuts.
Read more: Boeing Pauses 737 Max Production in Effort to Slow Cash Burn
Bloomberg Economics researcher Andrew Husby estimated that the first-quarter impact would be at most a subtraction of 1 percentage point from growth of gross domestic product. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli estimated in a report Tuesday that the indefinite halt will subtract around 0.5 percentage point from the first-quarter growth, and said that the eventual resumption of production should provide a lift to the expansion when it happens.
While such output reductions might be noticeable for a brief time and in line items such as exports, it’s a drop in the bucket for a $21.5 trillion economy and probably won’t be a longer-term blow.
“Boeing is a big company, big exporter, big manufacturer, and this is their most important product, but that doesn’t move the needle on full-year GDP,” Feroli said in an interview. “It’s just an indication of the size and breadth of the economy. It’s hard for one company to leave a lasting imprint.”
Analysts expect the U.S. economy to expand 2.2% in 2019, based on the fourth-quarter change from a year earlier, followed by 1.8% in 2020, in line with what economists generally see as the long-run potential rate.
“Assuming further production cuts -- including across suppliers -- and a halt to inventory accumulation, the impact on GDP in the first quarter could conceivably approach a 1 percentage point drag on the growth rate,” Husby said.
The effects of the halt will likely ripple through the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing reports, Fed industrial production data, and government figures on durable goods, he said.
Timing Unclear
The key complication, though, is that the halt is open-ended as Boeing doesn’t know when the plane will be approved for service. That makes supply-chain ripple effects much harder to predict, though Boeing did eliminate some uncertainty for many of its 150,000 employees by saying that it plans for those on the 737 program to continue related work or be temporarily assigned to other teams in Puget Sound.
The company had been producing the single-aisle planes at a pace of 42 per month, down from the 52-jet pace that the Seattle-area plant maintained before the fatal crashes. There are now about 400 in storage, Boeing said Monday.
Even so, as production continued in the months since the grounding, measures of manufacturing have show that the broader impact has been manageable so far.
The Commerce Department’s durable goods data show new orders and shipments for civilian aircraft and parts are both slower since the global grounding but remain far from collapsing. Average monthly bookings this year though October are running about a third lower than they were in the same time last year, while shipments are off about a sixth.
Boeing’s woes have been easier to see in trade, a category that has potential to weigh on GDP. U.S. exports of civilian aircraft since the grounding have been running below their longer-run average. The April tally of $2.6 billion was the lowest since 2011, Commerce Department data show.
Inventories, another category that flows into GDP calculations, have also been bloated by the hundreds of parked airliners. Stockpiles of commercial aircraft and parts, a category that’s been in a general uptrend for a decade and a half, have extended gains since March, rising 15% to a record $78 billion in October, the most recent Commerce Department data show.
Those civilian aircraft inventories account for 18% of total U.S. inventories of durable goods. The category was almost entirely responsible for the broader increase in October, the latest data available.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - World No. 1 shipbuilding group Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings Co Ltd's (KS:267250) $1.8 billion merger with rival Daewoo (KS:042660) could inflate prices, EU antitrust regulators warned on Tuesday as they opened a full-scale investigation.
Hyundai is seeking to reinforce its position as the world's biggest shipbuilder partly in response to overcapacity in the industry. The merged company would have a 21% market share, 
The European Commission said it had serious concerns about the deal, confirming a Reuters story on Dec. 9.
""Cargo shipbuilding is an important industry for the European Union,"" Margrethe Vestager, vice president of the European Commission, said in a statement.
Much of the EU's internal and extend freight trade went by sea and European shipping companies regularly purchased vessels from Hyundai and Daewoo.
""This is why we will carefully assess whether the proposed transaction would negatively affect competition in the construction of cargo ships, to the detriment of European consumers,"" Vestager said.
The Commission will decide by May 7 whether to clear or block the deal. The shipbuilders will likely have to offer concessions to address the concerns.
It said its concerns centered on the markets for large container ships and carriers of oil, liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, markets with high barriers to entry where competition could be reduced.
However, to forestall regulatory worries, the shipyards have already said they will compete independently after merging, with each company able to negotiate their own contracts with customers and suppliers.
They also want the EU to take into account the competitive threat from the merged China Shipbuilding Industry Corp (CSIC) and China State Shipbuilding Corp Ltd, other sources said previously, an entity with sales more than three times its own.
Competition regulators in South Korea, Singapore, China and Japan are also reviewing the deal, which has been approved in Kazakhstan. Singapore earlier this month voiced its concerns.

State-funded Korea Development Bank (KDB) owns 55.7 percent of Daewoo.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) said on Tuesday it was cancelling nearly double the number of flights through April than it has done since the Boeing 737 MAX grounding last March amid uncertainty over when the aircraft will fly again. 
Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX was banned in March after two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Last week, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it would not approve the aircraft's return to service before 2020, prompting Boeing to freeze 737 production for the first time in two decades. 
The production halt itself does not immediately impact airlines but the deepening crisis at Boeing is crimping the growth plans of top customers like Southwest, which are still awaiting deliveries of hundreds of 737 MAX planes that have already been built. 
The low-cost carrier said on Tuesday it was removing roughly 300 weekday flights from its total peak-day schedule of more than 4,000 daily flights through April 13, nearly double the amount it had canceled through March 6.
Southwest, the world's largest Boeing 737 MAX operator, had 34 MAX planes in its fleet when they were grounded in March and was hoping to take delivery of up to 41 more jets by early next year, allowing it to restore frequencies and routes it has been forced to cancel due to a shortage of aircraft.
Among the other U.S. 737 MAX carriers,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) last week extended its 737 MAX cancellations through April 6, while United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) is scheduling without the plane until early March. 

Airlines have said they will need at least one month after FAA approval to prepare their jets and pilots with software updates that Boeing has developed to address issues that played a role in both crashes.

1489,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 08:48AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russian officials in talks to transfer central bank's Sberbank stake - sources,"By Tatiana Voronova and Darya Korsunskaya
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian officials are in talks to transfer the central bank's stake in Sberbank (MM:SBER), the country's top lender, to another state entity, four sources said, as unease grows about the central bank's role as both owner and supervisor. 
Russia's central bank directly owns 50% plus one share in Sberbank's capital. It also became the owner of two other banks, Otkritie and Trust, after major bailouts of three private banking groups in 2017. 
The idea of transferring control in Sberbank, which holds around half of all retail deposits in the country and benefits from low funding costs, is not new.
But sources said the idea got a new lease of life after the central bank assumed combined financial markets supervision responsibilities in late 2013.
""This idea has taken shape - (the central bank) is both a mega-supervisor and shareholder (in Sberbank) at the same time,"" one of the four sources, who learned about the talks from Sberbank executives, said.
Two other high-ranked banking sources and a high-ranked state official confirmed preliminary discussions about the idea to transfer the central bank's stake in Sberbank.
There is as yet no clarity on how, if at all, the stake could be moved or to which state entity, as the decision is yet to be made, the sources said. 
The central bank and the finance ministry are also at odds how the dividends should be redistributed between the budget and the central bank itself. Sberbank's dividends make a significant contribution to the central bank's overall profit. 
Sberbank paid 361.4 billion roubles ($5.8 billion) in dividends this year. VTB (MM:VTBR), Russia's second biggest bank, is controlled by the state via the Federal Agency for Property Management, so its dividends go directly to the budget. 
Oleg Osipov, spokesman for Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, told Reuters that various questions were being discussed inside the government and that there was as yet no specific decision on a potential change of Sberbank's ownership. 
Sberbank declined to comment, saying it does not comment ""on market rumours or suggestions"". The finance ministry and the central bank did not reply to Reuters' requests for comments. 
The central bank plans to sell its holdings in Otkritie and Trust sometime next decade once both are fully recovered from the bailouts.

Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul all gained more than 1% and MSCI's all-country index (MIWD00000PUS) set a record high, putting its gains for 2019 at almost 23%, its best year in a decade and the fourth-best year ever.
""People are looking to close the year on a good note,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank in Singapore. ""I think that these are far more opportunistic than they are conviction trades, so they tend to be a little bit more prone to taking profits.""

The Australian dollar was another currency under pressure after the minutes of this month's RBA central bank meeting suggested it might cut interest rates again when it next meets in February.
The Reserve Bank of Australia has already cut three times since June, taking rates to a record low of 0.75%. ""Members agreed it would be concerning if there were a deterioration in the outlook,"" the bank's December minutes showed.
Elsewhere, investors were staying broadly optimistic over the tentative U.S.-Sino trade deal struck last week which fueled gains in emerging market currencies and capped the Japanese yen and Swiss franc .

The short seller questioned the value of the London-listed firm's assets and cash balance, as well as its reported profits and debts. Muddy Waters said in a research note that NMC's asset purchase prices and capital expenditures were inflated.
NMC, which is based in the United Arab Emirates, was not immediately available for comment. Britain's financial watchdog declined to comment.
Shares in the healthcare provider plunged more than 28%, sliding to the bottom of London's bluechip index (FTSE) and were on track for their worst day ever.
NMC, which has operations across 17 countries, reported net debt and payables of $1.89 billion at the end of 2018, according to its annual report. NMC said in October it expected double-digit revenue and core earnings growth in 2020.
Muddy Waters, known in financial markets for declaring short equity positions on the basis of its in-house research, said NMC's reported cash balances could be ""materially overstated"" and said its margins were ""too good to be true"" relative to UAE-focused publicly traded companies Mediclinic International Plc (L:MDCM) and  Aster DM Healthcare Ltd  (NS:ATRD).
About 10% of NMC's outstanding shares were in short position as of Dec. 13, according to FIS data. It was not immediately clear how much of that short position was accounted for by Muddy Waters, a company founded by American Carson Block.
Short sellers borrow shares and immediately sell them, betting the price will fall. They then buy the shares back and return them to the lender, aiming to pocket the capital gain.
Advocates say the practice puts a check on investor over-confidence and corporate spin. Critics say it destabilizes markets because shortsellers have an interest in driving a company's share price down.
Muddy Waters, which came to fame by betting against some Chinese companies, took its first short position in a London-listed company in August, when it bet against litigation funder Burford Capital (L:BURF).

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is investigating whether sharing data with outside competitors could be extended beyond banks to savings, insurance, mortgages, investments, pensions and consumer credit to increase innovation and choice.
'Open banking' rules already allow payment companies and other providers to use account data, with customer consent, to offer rival services and has opened the door to payments services for many financial technology or ""fintech"" firms.
The Financial Stability Board, a global regulatory body, has said that Big Tech companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL),  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could be forced to share data on financial services customers with banks and fintechs to prevent unfair competition.
Britain's FCA said on Tuesday that going a step further with open finance could set up ""dashboards"" to help consumers keep an eye on their finances, encourage shopping around for better deals, and become a means to obtain financial advice.
""We want to understand what is needed to ensure open finance develops in the best interests of consumers, and what role we should play,"" it said in a statement.
The FCA said there have been several instances of unfair price discrimination on longstanding consumers in general insurance, cash savings and mortgage markets.
""In each of these markets, the impact of price discrimination has been exacerbated by a lack of shopping around by some consumers. Open finance is a potential long-term solution,"" the FCA said.
The British watchdog opened a ""call for input"" until March 2020, after which it will publish a feedback statement, and gave examples of where data could be shared:"
1496,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 07:17AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse investigates report of surveillance on second executive,"By Michael Shields and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is looking into a report by a Swiss newspaper that its then-human resources boss was followed by private detectives in February, reviving concerns about its practices after a similar surveillance operation was uncovered in September.
The detailed report in the conservative Neue Zuercher Zeitung (NZZ), a Swiss newspaper widely read in the financial industry, suggests the surveillance of former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan, which shook the Swiss financial sector and damaged the bank's reputation, may not be an isolated incident as Credit Suisse has said.
The bank said it would carry out both an internal and independent assessment of the NZZ allegations. 
""Credit Suisse is examining the new information as revealed by the media in internal and external reviews,"" a spokesman said.
The bank had earlier referred to a statement it gave to the paper, saying the investigation it launched via law firm Homburger into the Khan incident had turned up no evidence that other Credit Suisse employees had been under observation.
The NZZ cited documents and photographs that it said arose from the surveillance of former human resources head Peter Goerke in February, just before he left Credit Suisse's management board to become a senior adviser at the bank. 
""The circumstances indicate that it was Credit Suisse that via a go-between gave the mandate for this surveillance,"" the paper said, adding that it was unclear why Goerke was followed. 
Goerke could not be reached immediately for comment.
The inquiry into the tailing of Khan cleared Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam but cost the job of his right-hand man, then-chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee.
Credit Suisse shares were 0.4% lower by 1200 GMT, while the European banking sector index (SX7P) was down 1%.
""It's not enough to sell out but I'm not amused,"" said one top-50 shareholder in Credit Suisse, on condition of anonymity. ""He (Thiam) really needs to make clear that these things are not going to happen again.""
INAPPROPRIATE SURVEILLANCE 
The Khan case prompted a criminal investigation by Zurich prosecutors, which is still open, after the star banker confronted a detective following him in September. 
Thiam has said he did not directly or indirectly authorize the surveillance of Khan, who left after a spat with Thiam and later joined arch-rival UBS Group (S:UBSG). The investigation looked into whether Khan was trying to recruit former colleagues to join him at UBS, but found no evidence that he was. 
Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner apologized to Khan in October for an ""inappropriate surveillance operation"" and said the bank did not condone the shadowing of employees. 
NZZ said the objective of the three-day ""Project Kuesnacht"" operation in February was to track the movements of Goerke, who had followed Thiam to Credit Suisse from British insurer  Prudential  (LON:PRU), to see where he went and with whom he met.
The operation cost 12,000 Swiss francs ($12,035) and involved four cars with two detectives each, it said. 
Thiam said in October a ""media campaign"" surrounding the tailing of Khan had not deterred clients and had left business unscathed. 
Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that a former Credit Suisse executive told top bank executives as well as U.S. and Swiss authorities that she was put under surveillance in 2017 while in a dispute with the bank.
Credit Suisse said it did a thorough internal investigation and found her claims were baseless.

The two carriers said on Tuesday their new joint business agreement would enable them to cooperate more on scheduling and pricing, open up more destinations between the two countries and develop a combined route network from Beijing's new airport. 
The pair, which have had a code-sharing deal since 2017, will now code-share on all direct flights operated between London and the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Sanya, Wuhan and Zhengzhou.
Code-sharing allows two or more carriers to publish and advertise tickets on the same plane under different flight numbers, helping to reduce the number of empty seats on flights. 
Alex Cruz, chairman and CEO of British Airways, part of the IAG (L:ICAG) group of airlines, said the deal would benefit customers. 
""The agreement reinforces our commitment to boost tourism and business travel between the two countries and we look forward to strengthening the relationship further,"" he said in a statement. 
China Southern also has a strategic partnership with  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL). 
American and British Airways are both members of the Oneworld group of airlines which China Southern could look to join after it said it would leave rival alliance SkyTeam in 2018.

Oneworld and SkyTeam are two of three global airline alliances that provide reciprocal benefits for passengers such as lounge usage and frequent flyer points and give airlines transfer passengers from partners in a boost to revenue. Star Alliance is the third.

The plan would impose restrictions on off-exchange transactions and provide an incentive program for market making in shares in the Tel Aviv 35 index (TA35), similar to those available in leading exchanges worldwide.
TASE, which went public in August, has lost 40% of investors since 2010. With 447 traded companies at a market value of $215 billion, the exchange has been struggling with delistings and declining trading volumes.
In 2019, nearly 23% of the total volume of securities trading on TASE derived from transactions entered into off the exchange - some 80,000 a year, averaging 800,000 shekels ($231,000) per transaction. Reporting off-exchange transactions is not mandatory in Israel and they may be entered into at any agreed price and volume.
""This is significantly harmful to liquidity and to market depth and disrupts transparency to investors, in the absence of real-time full disclosure of the transactions,"" TASE said in a statement.
TASE is considering imposing a real-time reporting obligation on all transactions and permitting such transactions only for securities defined as ""illiquid"".
TASE is also considering improving liquidity by encouraging market-making in major shares through incentives to stock exchange members that meet certain criteria. The program would be assessed over the course of a year.
To date, there is virtually no market-making in major shares in Israel. Exchanges such as Euronext, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Swiss Stock Exchange, the Korean Stock Exchange and more operate incentive programs for market-makers.
The programs are based on payments or refund of fees to market-makers, who make it easier for traders and investors to buy and sell.

1501,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 05:16AM ET</span>",Accounting body proposes standardizing how companies report profit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Listed companies must standardize their definition of operating profit in financial statements to help investors make comparisons more easily, an international standard setting body proposed on Tuesday.
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) said a sample of 100 companies found that 63 were using at least nine different definitions of operating profit.
Hans Hoogervorst, chair of the IASB whose rules are mandatory for listed companies in over 140 countries, including the European Union but not the United States, said the proposal was a ""game changer"".
""Investors have been yearning for this for a long time,"" Hoogervorst said.
""When investors want to make an estimate of the value of a company, they want to look at profit and loss, and at the operating profit and sustainability of earnings.""
Operating profit is a subtotal in statements that reflects the core business of a company, Hoogervorst said. An operating profit as defined by the IASB would also be subject to external auditor checks.
The proposal is being put out to public consultation and a final rule would not come into effect before 2022.
As more financial information is being produced and consumed electronically, a single definition set by regulators is needed when comparing hundreds of companies, Hoogervorst said.
A mandatory operating profit definition is part of a package that will introduce more ""discipline"" in the use of ""non-GAAP"" figures in financial statements, a reference to earnings numbers that are not defined by regulators.
Graphic: IASB Graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/38CdSZK
The IASB is proposing guidance for companies to shed more light on ""unusual"" or one-off income or expense items to help investors predict future cash flows better.
It would be harder for companies to lump together items without proper labeling or explanations.
""We do not say every unusual item is a bit fishy, but it will be more disciplined in the future,"" Hoogervorst said.
Companies will also have to explain their use of ""performance measures"" like adjusted operating profit that are not defined by regulators.
They will also have to reconcile these performance measures with figures in company statements that are defined by regulators.
Self-defined performance measures often show rosier outcomes than measures set out by regulators, Hoogervorst said."

The sale marks the first time the network, one of the biggest Russian-language broadcasters outside of Russia, will be majority owned by a foreign shareholder, a spokesman said.
The network was owned by Ruslan Sokolov since 2012 and Israyelyan, an entertainment industry entrepreneur and chief executive of the Muse Lifestyle Group, has bought Sokolov's entire stake, the spokesman said.
RTVI, which broadcasts in Russian in more than 50 countries including the United States, said it plans to open bureaus in Washington and California, focusing on programming for Russian diaspora communities.

Both banks passed the Bank of England's annual assessment of balance sheet strength but plans to double a 100 basis point capital buffer designed to protect lenders in depressed economic conditions could put both bank's 2020 share buyback plans in jeopardy, analysts said.
""Given we have not seen an acceleration in credit growth, we conclude this is being put in place to be, for lack of a better word, a ""Brexit buffer"" as the Bank of England has now determined that a 2% buffer is more appropriate in a ""standardized risk environment,"" Jefferies analyst Joseph Dickerson said.
Lloyds shares were trading 4.8% down at 0841 GMT while RBS shares dropped by 3.8%, erasing some of the gains booked since the business-friendly Conservative Party recorded its best election result in decades on Friday.
The increase in the countercyclical buffer is seen likely to lead to a reduction in core tier 1 capital requirements by a similar amount, allowing major British lenders to absorb up to 23 billion pounds of losses in a downturn without restricting lending.
But near-term goals to deliver more than a billion pounds of shareholder rewards via a buyback bonanza must now be considered ""best case"", according to analysts at KBW.
Shares in  Barclays  (L:BARC) were also trading down 3% at 0841 GMT. Like Lloyds, the Bank of England said Barclays would need to convert some of their AT1 capital into equity during a stress scenario, if new accounting rules that fully take effect in 2023 were applied."
1504,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 04:58AM ET</span>",Explainer: How the 737 MAX production freeze affects airlines across the globe,"By Jamie Freed and Tracy Rucinski
SYDNEY/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has decided to suspend production of its best-selling 737 MAX model from January, the plane maker's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years, as repercussions from two deadly crashes drag into 2020.
The U.S. manufacturer said on Monday it would prioritize the delivery of the 400 737 MAX jets it had made since the model was grounded globally rather than feeding more airplanes into production.
""This temporary move will put our system in a better position to recover and more efficiently deliver completed airplanes once we safely return the 737 MAX to service,"" Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Stan Deal told employees in a memo seen by Reuters.
Global airlines also have more than 370 of the planes that were delivered between the 737 MAX's May 2017 introduction and March 2019 grounding and are now parked at airports and at desert storage around the world.
HOW WILL THE 737 MAX PRODUCTION FREEZE IMPACT AIRLINES?
The immediate impact is likely to be muted because once the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approves the 737 MAX to resume flying, airlines' first priority is to prepare the 737 MAX jets already in their fleets to return to service.
Then they will look to take delivery of the 400 planes that have been produced since the grounding.
Analysts estimate Boeing has the ability to deliver a maximum of 70 of the planes to customers per month, meaning getting through that backlog would take nearly six months, even if it kept the pause on production for that entire period.
FAA approval to resume flying is not likely until at least February and could be delayed until March, U.S. officials have told Reuters.
Other global regulators, including in Europe and China, have indicated they could take even longer to approve the plane's return.
737 MAX operators Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co , United Airlines Holdings Inc and Fiji Airways said they were studying Boeing's announcement on the production halt and were unable to comment immediately on the impact to their schedules and capacity plans.
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE AIRLINES TO RETURN THE 737 MAX TO SERVICE ONCE REGULATORS APPROVE IT?
Airlines will have to install Boeing's new software, run a series of maintenance checks on their idled jets and implement the recommended pilot training, the latter of which could vary from country to country.
U.S. carriers have said the process will take at least a month following FAA approval.
The return could also depend on regulators outside an airline's home jurisdiction. Singapore Airlines Ltd has said that even if Singapore approves the return of the 737 MAX, it will need permission from authorities in Indonesia and China for its planes to resume their normal routes.
WILL THE RETURN OF HUNDREDS OF GROUNDED PLANES LEAD TO OVER-CAPACITY?
The impact will vary in different regions. In the United States, 737 MAX operators like Southwest, United and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc have said they see demand for the flight frequencies and routes they plan to restore or launch when the model returns.
Analysts, however, have expressed concern about the impact of any slowdown in U.S. consumer spending.
In Europe and Asia, travel demand has been more muted in recent months as economic growth slows, leading to a risk of heightened competition and declining fares once the 737 MAX returns.
""Airlines in Europe are actually quite happy with the delay as it removes over-capacity from the market at a time when the economy is in slo-mo,"" Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said.
Passenger demand growth in Asia fell to 3.5% in October from 6.2% a year earlier, showed data from the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. Its members are cautious about the outlook for 2020 after trade disputes undermined confidence and led to economic growth below initial forecasts this year."
1505,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 04:34AM ET</span>",2019 Was Great for European Markets. Now for the Bad News,"(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
With the Stoxx 600 now trading at a record high after surging 24% since the start of the year, 2019 is on track to be the third-best year for European equities in two decades after strong runs in 1999 and 2009 -- 9 seems to be the lucky number. Now, what comes next is anyone’s guess, but looking at 2020 the market is set to face serious hurdles which could make it difficult to repeat this year’s rally.
First, the earnings trend. Forecast downgrades have been a main feature of 2019, as bottom-up analysts relentlessly cut their their estimates. The negative trend is still going on, and most strategists say the 2020 consensus is still too high. Next year, companies in the Stoxx 600 are expected to see profit growth of 8.9%, compared to 9.3% for S&P 500 companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Earnings downgrades for Europe, excluding the U.K., have outnumbered upgrades since April. For UBS Global Wealth Management, tepid profit growth predictions support its preference for U.S. stocks over Europe.
“The U.S. profit cycle feels ‘long in the tooth’ but we still see a mix of better revenue growth, and higher and more sustainable margins than in the euro zone,” said Maximilian Kunkel, chief investment officer for Germany at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Greater volumes of share buybacks are likely going to mean that U.S. earnings growth is going to outperform euro-area earnings growth.”
Economic growth remains a big question mark for Europe in 2020, with risks of a further slump in manufacturing. The challenging outlook was highlighted by the European Central Bank last week, which revised down its projection for expansion next year.
The latest batch of PMI data on Monday confirmed that economic woes aren’t behind us yet. IHS Markit said the bloc’s employment growth slowed to a five-year low and Composite PMI signaled fourth-quarter output will be the weakest since the region exited a double-dip recession in the second half of 2013. In France, service-sector resilience largely countered an unexpectedly sharp drop in manufacturing momentum, while Germany’s industrial slump deepened. That said, overall economic surprises have been on the rise and turned positive in December, but further improvement might be needed.
The U.K. might have reached a tipping point last week, which could mark the start of a new era for Europe’s biggest laggard of 2019. A glance at stocks on Friday would tell you how thrilled markets were with the election outcome. But it’s a euphoria beset by caveats for 2020 and beyond.
A Conservative government and the Brexit deal it will pursue is “no silver bullet,” said James Dowey, a fund manager on the global equity team at Liontrust Asset Management. The departure from the EU will “very likely incur significant long-term economic costs” and the real problem for the U.K.’s economy and its companies is still low productivity, which Brexit is more likely to hinder than help.
And while the risk of a no-deal exit is small, “2020 is likely to remain a complicated year of negotiations and roller-coaster headlines” which will keep Brexit-sensitive assets in the U.K. and Europe volatile, said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis IM Solutions.
Finally, portfolio managers will be worried about bond yields. Firstly, the U.S. yield curve has been a good indicator of incoming recessions in the past. Second, market leadership is driven by bond yields and the recent inflection of the 10-year German bund yield should drive value and cyclical shares higher."
1506,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 04:31AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Unilever, Boeing Pour Cold Water on Stoxx Euphoria","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Two industry heavyweights, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and   Unilever   (LON:ULVR), administered a large dose of reality to European stocks early Tuesday, forcing markets to pull back after Monday’s euphoria.
 Unilever  (LON:ULVR) tumbled over 5.5% after warning that it will miss its sales growth this year due to economic weakness in India, one of its most important markets. The Reserve Bank of India cut its growth forecast for the current fiscal year to 5% at its policy meeting earlier this year, the slowest rate in six years. It had been running at over 8% less than two years ago. Unilever also said shareholders would have to wait a bit longer for a recovery in North America, another key market. 
 Unilever  (LON:ULVR) said it expects underlying sales growth to stay below its target of 3%-5% in the first half of next year, before picking up again in the second half. Even so, full-year growth is likely to stay in the lower half of the range – hardly a performance that is likely to close the valuation gap on its arch-rival Nestle (SIX:NESN). Unilever now trades at less than 16 times trailing 12-month earnings, whereas Nestle trades at 34 times after a series of disposals, buybacks and other moves intended to sharpen shareholder returns under CEO Mark Schneider.
Meanwhile, European aerospace stocks suffered from Boeing’s decision to halt production of its 737 MAX aircraft in January, a decision that puts a big hole in the order books of the companies that supply parts to it.
U.K.-based midcap Senior PLC (LON:SNR) was the worst affected, falling 7.5% by 4:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), while France’s   Safran   (PA:SAF) fell 4.5% and engine supplier Rolls Royce (LON:RR) fell 1.2%.
Airbus (PA:AIR), Boeing’s largest rival, rose initially but soon gave up almost all of its gains. While the temporary loss of its biggest competitor in one segment should allow Airbus to pad its margins for a while, the benefits have already largely been priced in, given that the stock has already risen 54% this year (Boeing’s are now back where they started the year, after losing 12% in the last month).
Nor did the macro backdrop give broader markets much reason for cheer. They all fell back after reports that U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will enact legislation to ensure that the transition phase after Brexit ends at the end of 2020, as scheduled. Given the difficulties of negotiating a comprehensive trade deal with the EU by then, the move was widely seen as re-introducing the risk of a “no-deal Brexit” scenario, disappointing hopes that Johnson would use his large majority in parliament to face down the more radical Brexiteers in his party.

Consumer giant    Unilever    (LON:ULVR) shaved its sales forecast for this year and said the first half of 2020 will also be weak, citing the economic slowdown in India and difficult trading conditions in West Africa. It also noted that a recovery in North America “will take time.”

Underlying sales growth will be “slightly below its guidance of the lower half of its 3%-5% multi-year range,” the company said. In the first half of 2020, growth will fall below 3% before picking up again in the second half. Even so, CEO Alan Jope said he expects 2020 growth to be below 4%. 
""Growth remains our top priority and we are confident we have the right strategy and investment in place to step up our performance,"" Jope said.
Quality assurance provider Intertek (LON:ITRK) said it agreed to buy Check Safety First, a health, safety, quality and security risk management business that works in travel, tourism and hospitality, for an undisclosed sum.
CSF has annual revenue of around 10 million pounds.

Middle eastern-focused clinic operator NMC Health (LON:NMC) said it had agreed to buy back $90 million of convertible debt due 2025 at a price of 92.5c on the dollar.
The deal cuts the outstanding issue volume by 20%, leaving $360 million outstanding.

Distribution and services group   Bunzl   (LON:BNZL) said revenue for 2019 was expected to increase by between 2% and 3%, in line with its prior guidance. Underlying revenue growth at constant exchange rates is still seen as coming in flat.
The group cited “mixed macroeconomic and market conditions”.
 Bunzl  (LON:BNZL) also announced the acquisition of Fire Rescue Safety Australia, its third buy of the year, bringing its total M&A spend up to 120 million pounds. FRSA has annual revenue of 37 million Australian dollars (19 million pounds).

Oilfield services group Petrofac (LON:PFC) said it expects a tough 2020 marked by falling revenue and high investment needs.
The group said it has only $4 billion of secured revenue so far for the year, compared to expected revenue of $5.5 billion this year (it upheld prior guidance for 2019 in its statement).
Net margins in the engineering and construction unit, which accounts for the bulk of revenue, are expected to fall due to a bigger share of business coming from lower-margin markets.


Ticketing company Trainline (LON:TRNT) said it expected revenue growth of somewhere in the region of 20-25% for the year, in line with prior guidance.
Group revenue increased 26% to 198 million pounds for the nine months to the end of November, with ticket sales hitting 2.9 billion pounds. The launch of new services in Europe and the U.K., allowing it to squeeze more in revenue from net ticket sales, helped revenue rise 31% in the U.K. and 90% in Europe. The company said it expected ""some near-term impact"" from the current French strikes.

1511,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 01:46AM ET</span>",Boeing's production pause will not end 737 Max cash burn: analysts,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is expected to continue burning cash despite pausing production of its 737 MAX jet, as it will leave its workforce intact and likely provide support to suppliers, analysts said.
Some estimated the cash burn at around $1 billion a month.
The airline said on Monday it would suspend production in January, its biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years, as repercussions from two deadly crashes of the now-grounded aircraft drag into 2020.
Boeing, which builds the 737 south of Seattle, said it would not lay off any of the roughly 12,000 employees there during the production freeze.
""We estimate that Boeing is burning nearly $2 billion per month on the MAX but this will not drop to zero during the halt,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said in a note to clients.
They assumed more than half of those costs will remain due to internal overhead and staff expenses as well as support for key suppliers like fuselage producer Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR).
Analysts at Jefferies estimated a cash burn of more than $730 million a month.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration needs to certify software changes and training plans before the plane can resume flying in the United States. Other regulators then need to sign off for it to return in other parts of the world.
The duration of the production halt is uncertain, making it hard to forecast the financial impact on Boeing and its suppliers.
""We don't know what Boeing plans to do about its suppliers,"" said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group.
""They might need them to stop component, systems, and structures deliveries, but it would still need to help these suppliers keep workers and capacity so they can go back to full output when the time comes.""
Jefferies estimated the halt could last three months, which would reduce its 2020 737 MAX delivery forecast to 462 planes from 807.
It would take until the second half of 2022 for Boeing to be fully clear of inventory, given it has produced 400 of the jets since the March grounding that have yet to be delivered to customers, Jefferies said.
""Given the grounding has stretched longer than expected, we believe we could see the payments/concession increase from initial levels,"" it said of compensation to airlines, for which Boeing announced a $5.6 billion pre-tax charge in July.
""Assuming the delay stretches through March, we calculate total concessions of $11.7 billion,"" Jefferies said.
Boeing said it would provide financial information regarding the production suspension in connection with its fourth-quarter earnings release in late January."

 “The AAHK has acted…to detain seven idle aircraft of Hong Kong Airlines in order to protect financial interests,” the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) said. 
 
The seizure was made in accordance to the Airport Authority Ordinance, which allows the authority to sell the planes if it is not repaid within 60 days of the detention.
 
The cash-strapped carrier, which is the city’s third biggest airline, was reportedly on the brink of collapse but received funding two weeks ago to ensure its survival for now. 
 
The AAHK deemed the airline’s financial situation had “deteriorated rapidly” as it could not pay its staff on time last month.

1514,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",Defaults in One of China’s Richest Provinces Spook Investors,"(Bloomberg) -- Six privately owned companies in one of China’s wealthiest provinces have defaulted on their debt or come perilously close in the last three months. With 68.1 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) in outstanding debt among those six companies alone, the distress in Shandong has rattled even seasoned investors.
The problem isn’t the defaults themselves -- other provinces have seen more and worse. It’s the practice common among Shandong companies of guaranteeing each others’ debts. Firms don’t have to make public these liabilities, leaving investors to wonder who’s on the hook and for how much. With the once-strong industrial economy flagging, the murky ties between the province’s private companies threaten to drag them all down together.
This is one of many challenges bond investors must grapple with in China now, after defaults onshore climbed from zero just a few years ago to 126.7 billion yuan ($18 billion) in 2019. In Shandong and elsewhere, it’s still unclear how the government will intervene. Policy makers have been increasingly willing to let weak companies fail, but they’re also under pressure to keep the economy growing and the markets stable.
As of now, Shandong’s city and local governments have stepped in with piecemeal relief. It’s uncertain whether the provincial government will do the same. As a result, the province’s firms risk entering a vicious cycle that “spreads solvency risks to the entire region, swamping the good credits along with the bad,” according to an October report from S&P Global Ratings.
The default rate for bonds issued by non-state companies across China increased to a record 4.5% in the first 10 months of 2019, Fitch Ratings said in a Dec. 3 report, adding that the figure might understate the true level of defaults given that some borrowers settle with bondholders privately rather than through clearing houses. The rate for state-owned companies was just 0.2% thanks to financial support from the government and better access to funding from banks, Fitch said.
In Shandong, fears of contagion show up in unusual ways. In late October, bad news about a corn and steel conglomerate in the province dragged down the bonds from at least two seemingly unrelated provincial neighbors. Aluminum producer China Hongqiao Group Ltd. and food distributor Shandong Sanxing Group had been known to back other companies’ debt, and investor concerns that they’d be responsible dragged their bonds to record lows.
Hongqiao tried to reassure its creditors, saying it doesn’t have a business relationship with the group and didn’t plan to offer any financial support. The three main international rating companies haven’t changed their assessments on the borrower since then but investors remained unconvinced. The yield of one of its dollar bond hit 14% last week, a new high.
“Shandong’s privately-owned enterprise default rate isn’t particularly high compared to the national one,” said Jenny Huang, Director of China Corporate Research at Fitch Ratings. “But recently, the risks have exploded.”
Shandong is one of China’s oldest economic centers, built first on trade, then agriculture, mining and oil drilling. Not long ago, the economy was still booming, credit was cheap and private firms were on a spending spree, restrained only by limited access to capital. In communist-run China, state-owned banks tend to favor state-owned companies for loans.
So city governments encouraged the private sector to support itself. Cross-guarantees were one solution. They also concentrated the financial risks, says S&P analyst Cindy Huang.
“Cross-guarantees tend to be clustered around certain cities and regions rather than across the province,” she said. “They’re often between private, unlisted companies from either the same city, same sector or where CEOs know one another.”
It’s not clear how common cross-guarantees are in the rest of China, an information gap that heightens investors’ anxiety. There was one analyst who tracked them at Citic Securities Co., and he left the field earlier this year. His last survey, in 2018, suggested that cross-guarantees had made Shandong firms more vulnerable than anywhere else in the country.
In the last year, Shandong’s economy has slowed dramatically. Demand for industrial products is down overall; in the province, industrial profits fell 15.5% through October relative to a year earlier. It’s still China’s third-richest province, but through the first nine months of 2019, it grew by just 5.4%, one of the slowest in China.
Every week now seems to bring news of a new default or firm under stress. Two companies, Shandong Yuhuang Chemical Co. and Xiwang Group, have defaulted on 4 billion yuan ($572 million) of domestic notes since October. Investors are watching whether luxury clothing giant Shandong Ruyi Technology Group will repay a 344 million dollar bond on Thursday. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the firm last week on heightened refinancing risks.
Some of Shandong’s firms may find some reprieve from local and city governments. State-owned Jining City Construction, for example, came to the rescue of Ruyi in October. It agreed to become the company’s second-largest shareholder and provide a guarantee for some of its debt. Even still, S&P downgraded and later withdrew Ruyi’s rating at the company’s request sending notes to record lows.
Chinese authorities have reasons to save jobs and preserve social stability, but it’s unlikely they’ll bail out every struggling firm and not always clear how relief will be allocated. The political will to rescue China’s private companies has been waning since Beijing allowed the first defaults in 2014.
That puts growing pressure on businesses and their bondholders to work out solutions by themselves. “The next step is to see if local companies can successfully refinance,” said Ivan Chung, head of greater China credit research and analysis at Moody’s. He echoed mounting calls for companies to provide more and better information to their investors. “In the long run, companies must become more transparent and improve corporate governance to restore the confidence of financial institutions.”

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 11:21PM ET</span>",Asian financial firms face 'benchmark-aggedon' as tough EU rules near,"By Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Banks and asset managers that use Asian benchmarks like the Hang Seng or Nikkei indices face a ""perfect storm"", with two major regulatory changes slated to take effect the same day, a financial industry group said on Tuesday.
Financial contracts worth billions of dollars are based on the performance of certain benchmarks, while investment funds often track or hope to beat a benchmark's performance.
However, global authorities, particularly those in Europe, are now seeking to regulate benchmarks more tightly.
Those measures include replacing the London Interbank Offered Rate by the end of 2021 after the world's largest investment banks paid millions in fines to settle accusations that they had rigged that index.
Organizations that compile and publish market indexes outside the European Union were in February given an extension to the end of 2021 to comply with the EU's benchmark regulation (BMR).
However, a survey by the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA), released on Tuesday, found publishers have made little progress in meeting these standards.
""It is clear that non-EU administrators continue to face many of the same issues that they have struggled with in our first survey in 2017,"" said John Ball, an ASIFMA managing director.
EU banks and asset managers can only use compliant benchmarks for hedging or funding. If one does not exist in a market, that could force EU entities to leave, the report said.
Fifty-five important benchmarks in the region could be affected by the rules, including some in Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea.
Will Hallatt, head of Asia financial services regulation practice at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, said a separate, stronger focus on MifID II, another European Union law, when BMR was being drafted meant the latter got less attention.
""Now, ironically the two-year delay means it may not get attention again because it becomes effective the same day that US dollar and GBP Libor cease to exist,"" said Hallatt, whose firm co-wrote the report.
""I'm calling 1 January, 2022, benchmark-aggedon.""
It is unclear which benchmarks in Asia can comply in time.
Administrators can comply if their local jurisdiction is considered ""equivalent"" to the EU's regime, if they are ""recognised"" by a regulatory authority in an EU member state, or if they are ""endorsed"" by an EU benchmark administrator.
Administrators surveyed by ASIFMA reported practical difficulties with all three.
If EU companies cannot use a benchmark, local business may not be sufficient to sustain it.
""Everyone knows Libor is going, but which other benchmarks will disappear will only be known much closer to the deadline,"" said Hallatt."

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said on Tuesday Japan should make artificial intelligence (AI) a mandatory subject for college entrance exams, to counter the yawning gap with the United States and China in the nascent field.
Japanese students ""don't study if they are not asked... let's put it as mandatory, then Japanese students will catch up,"" Son told a government conference aimed at fostering innovation.
The comments came as Son pointed to the widening gap in GDP and AI-related patents filed in Japan compared to China and the United States.
""Japan has lost the past, but may be losing the future,"" he said.
Son said Japan should focus on two areas - autonomous driving and DNA-centered medicine - to help combat the pressures of its rapidly aging society, which is seeing a rise in traffic accidents involving elderly drivers and healthcare costs.
""Even today's technology of autonomous driving is better than senior citizens driving on the street,"" Son said.
SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund has focused investments in these two areas, including ride-hailer Uber Technologies (N:UBER) and medical testing firm  Guardant Health  (O:GH). Both companies have sold off in public markets recently.
As U.S.-China trade tensions create uncertainties along supply chains, Japan should leverage its close relationship with the United States to get ahead in cutting-edge tech, Son said.
""Instead of fighting against American technologies, let's collaborate,"" he said.
SoftBank last month announced it would scoop up messaging app operator Line Corp (T:3938), part of a wave of consolidation in Japan as U.S. tech giants make inroads."

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 0.5%.
 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 0.4% higher. South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.7%.
 
Asian stocks received continued support from news of a phase one trade deal between the U.S. and China. Under the agreement, the U.S. suspended its plan to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods, while China promised to purchase more American agricultural products.
 
Reports said the deal will be officially signed in early January, but it is unsure when the next phase of negotiations will begin. 
 
“I think markets are justifiably excited of any progress on the U.S.-China trade negotiation,” Hannah Anderson, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBCin an interview.
 
“However, there does remain quite a bit of work ... left to do and so I think markets are going to have a belated awakening to the fact that they can’t exactly dismiss this risk throughout 2020,” Anderson warned.

The audit, which was prepared by consulting firm Alix Partners, is likely to add further scrutiny on how much the Sackler family should pay to resolve lawsuits that Purdue Pharma face regarding the U.S. opioid epidemic, the New York Times added.
Lawsuits filed by state and local governments allege Purdue and the Sacklers contributed to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 people since 1999 by aggressively marketing opioids while downplaying their addiction and overdose risks.
The audit showed that from 2008 through 2017, Purdue's payouts to the Sackler family totaled $10.7 billion, the report said. The auditors reported that they did not know how much cash distributed to the Sacklers was actually used to pay taxes.
""We need full transparency into their total assets and must know whether they sheltered them in an effort to protect against creditors and victims,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said.
Purdue reaped up to $13 billion in profits to Sackler family, the U.S. states said in October, opposing efforts to halt lawsuits alleging the company and its owners helped fuel the epidemic.
""We are committed to holding the Sacklers responsible for the role they played in fueling the opioid crisis and will not stop fighting until we have achieved justice for victims,"" James said.
The drugmaker had filed for bankruptcy protection in September to pause thousands of lawsuits while it tries to build support for a proposed settlement it estimates is worth $10 billion.
The audit report was filed on Monday evening in bankruptcy court in White Plains, New York, the New York Times said."

This is likely to affect only a small number of sellers but ""limits the options for those small businesses on some of the highest-demand shipping days in history,"" a FedEx representative said.
Amazon and FedEx did not say how many packages would be affected by the restriction. Amazon declined to say how long the move would last. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the ban was due to FedEx's on-time performance.
Amazon said sellers can still use FedEx's pricier and faster Express services, including air transport, for Prime deliveries. The FedEx Ground and Home delivery options that are temporarily restricted for sellers' Prime shipments remain available for non-Prime shipments. Third-party sellers offer more than 50% of the goods on Amazon's site.
Amazon Prime members pay $119 per year for fast, ""free"" delivery.
Tensions between Amazon and FedEx became public this summer. FedEx canceled its delivery agreements with the world's leading online retailer just months after Amazon announced plans to speed up Prime shipping to one day from two days on millions of items.
On-time delivery rates during the record-setting Cyber Monday sales week were 90.4% for FedEx Corp, 92.3% for the U.S. Postal Service and 92.7% for  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), according to consultancy ShipMatrix.
Amazon van drivers delivered 93.7% of U.S. packages on time during that week.
ShipMatrix President Satish Jindel said the performances were not directly comparable because Amazon vans handle short-distance ""last-mile"" deliveries from fulfillment centers to customer doorsteps. Major shippers like FedEx and UPS move packages great distances - at times from factories on one U.S. coast to customer doorsteps on another - and are more exposed to weather and other disruptions.
News of the FedEx restrictions hit just ahead of FedEx's quarterly financial report on Tuesday.
""It's not about service, it's about being irritated with the relationship,"" Jindel said of Amazon's decision.
And it could have unintended consequences for Amazon, which is under increasing scrutiny from regulators, labor groups and consumer protection advocates.
""It will create more ill will toward Amazon and drive more third-party sellers to re-evaluate how they are managing their brands and if they want to be dictated to by Amazon,"" said Evan Armstrong, president of supply chain consulting firm Armstrong & Associates."

1522,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 07:59PM ET</span>",Boeing crisis deepens as 737 production stops for first time in two decades,"By Eric M. Johnson and David Shepardson
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co bowed to a growing cash squeeze by suspending commercial 737 production from January for the first time in more than 20 years, as the grounding of the planemaker's best-selling MAX after two fatal crashes drags into 2020.
Boeing, which builds the 737 south of Seattle, said it would not lay off any of the roughly 12,000 employees there during the production freeze, though the move could have repercussions across its global supply chain and the U.S. economy.
The decision at a two-day board meeting came after the Federal Aviation Administration refused to approve the jet's return to service before 2020 and delivered what was seen as a public rebuff to Boeing's hopes of moving faster. 
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months, costing the plane manufacturer more than $9 billion so far.
The decision to halt production will have little immediate impact on airlines that have already seen deliveries halted, forcing many to cancel flights or lease older replacements.
But it marks a deepening of a crisis that has already seen Boeing's fastest-selling jet grounded worldwide, its safety record scrutinized, customers pressing for compensation and its cornerstone relationship with the FAA placed under strain.
Until now Boeing has continued to produce 737 MAX jets at a rate of 42 per month and purchase parts from suppliers at a rate of up to 52 units per month, even though deliveries are frozen until regulators approve the aircraft to fly commercially again.
Boeing did not say how long the shutdown might last, stressing this was up to the FAA. Previous efforts to predict when the 737 MAX might return to service after software training changes had drawn a sharp response from the U.S. regulator.
The FAA said it would not comment on what it described as a Boeing business decision but would continue to work with global regulators to review proposed changes to the 737 MAX. 
""Our first priority is safety, and we have set no timeframe for when the work will be completed,"" the agency said. 
Analysts said the shutdown was inevitable after Boeing was forced to abandon its end-year goal for returning to service.
""It is not a surprise that they don’t continue producing planes that don’t have a home,"" said Adam Pilarski, senior vice president at Virginia-based consultancy AVITAS.
SHARES FALL
After holding out for months by keeping its factory lines running at optimum speed for a quick return, Boeing said it had decided to put emphasis on delivering some 400 planes that have been produced and stored, once the FAA gives the green light.
Such an emphasis would most quickly release much-needed cash for Boeing, but could cause other problems when production resumes, industry sources said. Supply chains are fragile due to record demand and abrupt changes in speed often cause snags.
In 1997, Boeing announced hefty charges after being forced to suspend 737 and 747 production due to factory problems.
Boeing did not say what extra financial impact the 737 MAX shutdown would have ahead of annual results due in January.
A spokesman said it would continue production of a military derivative of the 737, the P-8 maritime surveillance jet.
Boeing's shares closed down 4% on Monday and fell 1% after hours. Shares in Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc, its biggest supplier, closed down 2%. 
Spirit, which makes the MAX fuselage along with other parts such as pylons, said on Monday it would work with Boeing to understand any changes to the production rate.
Analysts highlighted  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co,  Safran  (PA:SAF) and Senior Plc as other suppliers that could experience disruptions. GE and Safran co-produce engines for the 737 MAX and unlike most suppliers are paid mostly once the airplanes are delivered to the airline buyer.
Airlines with 737 MAX jets and orders also face added uncertainty after already scaling back flying schedules and delaying growth plans. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), the largest 737 MAX customer, said last week it had reached a compensation agreement with Boeing for a portion of a projected $830 million hit to operating income in 2019 from the grounding.

On Monday, it said it was too early to assess the impact of the production halt.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) said on Monday it will provide $750 billion in financing, advisory services and investments for green projects and companies, as well as those that foster economic opportunities for under-served people over the next decade.
The bank sees ""a powerful business and investing case"" for working with companies that are taking steps to address climate change and inclusive growth, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon wrote in an editorial in the Financial Times announcing the goal.
Goldman's moves, which also included ruling out any new loans for Arctic drilling or thermal coal mines, came just as the United Nations concludes a conference that failed to ramp up efforts to combat global warming. (https://reut.rs/2YPhjry)
The $750 billion figure is essentially the dollar amount that Goldman estimates it can generate in providing banking services and investment to companies and projects that are focused on renewable energy, sustainable transportation, affordable education and several other areas. 
On a call with reporters, Goldman executives said those banking services would include dealmaking, private equity-type investing and providing loans, but they declined to break down the top line figure because it is dependent on market forces, they said. 
One example of work the bank believes it can replicate to meet this goal is a bond offering Goldman handled for Italian electricity company  Enel  (MI:ENEI) earlier this year. Enel raised $1.5 billion through a bond offering that linked the investments to its commitment to increase its renewable energy base by 25% before 2022.
The executives said the bank will not lose any significant amount of revenue as a result of the $750 billion target or the internal ban on financing certain drilling and coal activities. 

The bank has not financed any projects that would fall afoul of that ban in recent memory, one executive said, in part because Goldman's due-diligence process takes into consideration and often rules out deals if they impact endangered species and indigenous populations.

The Federal Trade Commission said on Monday it had approved the deal, which was originally announced in February, without requiring any asset sales to ensure the planned merger complies with antitrust law.
The FTC said in a statement the evidence ""did not indicate that Roche would have the incentive to delay or terminate Spark’s developmental effort for its hemophilia A gene therapy, or that the acquisition would affect Roche's incentives regarding (its hemophilia treatment drug]) Hemlibra.""
The commission, which is made up of three Republicans and two Democrats, voted 5-0 to approve the deal.
U.S. antitrust approval was the last needed by the company, Roche and Spark said in a joint statement.
Also on Monday, Roche won clearance from Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for the proposed merger.
When the deal was announced, Roche agreed to pay a big premium for Spark, more than twice the U.S. company's closing price on Feb. 22.
Basel-based Roche wants to buy U.S.-based Spark to gain a foothold in gene therapy and add to its growing portfolio of hemophilia A products. Its Hemlibra product, an anti-hemophilia A drug, is due to surpass $1 billion sales this year.
Hemophilia sufferers lack a protein that helps blood to clot, putting them at risk of serious health complications including internal bleeding, joint damage or death.
Hemophilia has traditionally been one of the most expensive - and for companies, most lucrative - treatment areas, with clotting factors running into the millions of dollars annually for some cases."
1525,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 05:40PM ET</span>","Spending deal does not hike EV credit, boosts aviation inspection funds","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress declined to extend a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles but will boost funding for aviation safety after two deadly Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes.
General Motors Co (N:GM) and Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) have been pushing for more than a year for extension of the credit, which phases out once an automaker hits 200,000 vehicles sold, and many lawmakers had been pushing to include the extension. The tax credit is aimed at defraying the cost of electric vehicles that are more expensive than similarly sized internal combustion engine vehicles.
Both GM and Tesla have already hit 200,000 EV sales. Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat who authored a proposal to extend the credit, said Monday the EV proposal faced significant opposition from the White House, according to her office.
Tesla's credit fell to $1,875 in July and will be zero after Dec. 31. GM's credit fell to $1,875 on Oct. 1 will be zero after March 31.
Stabenow proposed in April granting each automaker a $7,000 tax credit for an additional 400,000 vehicles on top of the existing 200,000 vehicles eligible for $7,500 tax credits. A separate bill in the U.S. House proposed a smaller credit for used EVs.
In response to two Boeing crashes that killed 346 people and led to the grounding of the 737 MAX fleet, Congress will increase funding for aviation safety by $67 million, which is ""targeted for hiring specialized staff with expertise in human factors; and increases training and credentialing requirements for safety inspectors.""
It also boosts funding to ""improve the safety reporting database... and to promote U.S. safety standards with foreign civil aviation authorities through outreach and training.""
The Federal Aviation Administration's certification of the MAX and its long-standing practice of delegating some tasks to Boeing has come under harsh criticism from lawmakers.
A report released in October said the FAA had just 45 people in an office overseeing Boeing’s Organization Designation Authority and its 1,500 employees.
The FAA’s office overseeing Boeing has just 24 engineers, some with limited experience, and they face a wide range of tasks to ensure compliance in overseeing Boeing’s 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 programs."

(Reuters) - Streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is accelerating its growth overseas, with its Asia-Pacific business recording the biggest membership and revenue gains among all regions over the past three years.
In an 8-K filed on Monday, the company provided details on its international business ahead of its January fourth-quarter earnings report, which will disclose revenue and membership by region for the first time.
Netflix provided a benchmark for investors, releasing historical streaming revenue, membership and average revenue per paying streaming membership by region for each quarter of 2017 and 2018; for the first three quarters of 2019; and for the twelve-month periods ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2018 and the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, 2019.
In the Asia-Pacific region - the company's smallest - revenue was up 153% from the end of the third quarter of 2017 to the end of the third quarter of 2019. Membership grew 148% in the period.
Growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa also accelerated. Membership in the region increased 132% from the end of the third quarter of 2017 to the end of the third quarter of 2019, and membership revenue increased 105% in the period.
In Latin America, where the company says it is in 33% of broadband homes, streaming revenue increased 71% from the end of the third quarter of 2017 to the end of the third quarter of 2019. Membership in the period grew 61%.
Netflix is focusing on its international business as the streaming landscape becomes more crowded, with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+ and Apple's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ entering the market and two other services - HBO Max, from AT&T-owned WarnerMedia, and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal's Peacock - set to launch next year."

1529,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 05:21PM ET</span>",Natural gas hedge fund Statar Capital up 30% this year: source,"By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Natural gas hedge fund Statar Capital LLC, led by ex-Citadel trader Ron Ozer, has gained about 30% so far this year, thanks to profitable bets on U.S. natural gas volatility, a source familiar with the matter said.
The fund had about $410 million in assets through November compared with about $200 million early this year, according to the source. The fund was up nearly 30% through November and about 42% since inception in September 2018.
Statar is one of the few remaining gas-focused hedge funds in the United States after a string of closures in recent years in part due to poor returns.
Velite Capital, once one of the most profitable U.S. gas funds, began winding down operations last year while others including Timoneer Energy, Madava Asset Management and Casement Capital have suspended operations.
""E&Ps are now producing and hedging more than they have historically, and since competition in providing liquidity has diminished, there is more edge in taking the other side of these trades,"" said Ozer, referring to exploration and production companies. He did not confirm the performance figures.
A spokeswoman for the fund declined to comment.
Statar profited from betting on U.S. natural gas implied volatility, a gauge of options demand, the source said.
Benchmark Henry Hub natural gas implied volatility hit a record high of 117.5% in November 2018 and a record low of 18.6% in April 2019. It climbed back to nearly 60% in late October.
U.S. natural gas production hit a record 83.80 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2018 and is expected to have surpassed that in 2019. The pace of growth is expected to slow in 2020, however.
A part of Statar's gains also came from trading European natural gas.
British and Dutch gas prices, the benchmarks for Europe-wide gas sales as well as some liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets, hit 10-year lows this year, weighed down by an influx of supplies from Russia, the United States and others.
Hedge fund Citadel's commodities business is up at least $1 billion this year, driven by European gas trading, sources said.
Statar plans to expand further into European markets as global gas markets become more interlinked through increased LNG trade in coming years, the source said, adding the fund is still going to be predominantly U.S.-focused. The company also recently hired Xing Yuan as portfolio manager from Balyasny Asset Management."
1530,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 05:17PM ET</span>","Stocks - China Growth, Easing Trade Tensions Fuel Wall Street Rally","Investing.com – Stocks surged Monday with the major indexes hitting all-time highs and closing highs.
The catalysts were decent data on factory production and consumer spending in China and continuing market euphoria that at least some sort of U.S. trade deal looks done.
The gains came despite a 4.29% decline in shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) on reports the company may shut down production of its 737 Max jetliner until it wins an OK from the Federal Aviation Administration.
After the close, Boeing said it would suspend 737 Max production in January. The move will affect suppliers both in the United States and globally. Boeing is the largest U.S. manufacturer exporter. The shares fell more than 1% after hours. 
Also falling were Spirit Aerosystems Holdings (NYSE:SPR), which makes the fuselages for the plane and   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) and   Safran   (PA:SAF) SA (OTC:SAFRY), which make the engines for the plane.
 
The S&P 500 was up 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.91%. The Dow Jones industrials rose just 0.36%, or 100 points. The blue chips, however, had been up as many as 200 points early in the session.
Boeing's decline subtracted nearly 100 points from the Dow by itself. Twenty-three Dow stocks were higher, led by UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH),   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) was flat at $54.42.
Boeing was the second worst S&P 500 performer on the day.
All 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by energy, health care, utilities, technology and financial stocks.
In addition to the data from China, stocks in Europe surged after the Conservatives' win in last week's election in the United Kingdom.
One could see the China effect on stocks in chicken-producer   Tyson Foods   (NYSE:TSN), which hopes to export chicken to China next and started the process to make that happen. A swine-flu epidemic has forced massive culling of poultry, amid high demand. Also higher: fertilizer company Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) and Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), which also has hopes for China. 
US Corn Futures jumped 1.7%, Soft Red Winter Wheat Futures rose 3.2% and US Soybeans Futures were up 1.4% in the futures trading.
 
 
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares fell 1% after Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it would not allow vendors selling wares to Prime customers to use FedEx Ground. The ostensible reason was poor service, but Amazon has been trying to stop shipping with anything related to FedEx.
Energy shares were higher on the prospect of higher oil prices as OPEC members try to rein in production. West Texas Intermediate  crude rose 14 cents to $60.21. Brent Oil Futures crude, the global benchmark, were up 15 cents to $65.37. WTI is up 9.1% this month alone and nearly 33% for the year. Brent, up 8.1% in December, is up 21.5% for the year.
 
Interest rates also moved higher as investors moved cash away from bonds into stocks. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.873% from 1.791% on Friday.
Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG),   Under Armour   (NYSE:UAA), Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) and semiconductor maker   Western Digital   (NASDAQ:WDC) were the top performers in the S&P 500. 
International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) and   ABIOMED   (NASDAQ:ABMD) were the weakest S&P 500 performers."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The price of the largest U.S. high-yield bond exchange-traded fund hit a two-year top on Monday as optimism about the ""phase one"" U.S.-China trade deal pushed investors into riskier corners of the market.
The iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) rose to $87.83, the highest since Jan. 26, 2018. The second-largest U.S. junk bond ETF by market capitalization, the SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) High Yield Bond ETF (JNK), reached its highest since June 20, 2019 at a peak of $109.47 and could also climb to a two-year high if the rally continues this week.
The ""phase one"" trade deal between Washington and Beijing has been ""absolutely completed,"" National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told Fox News Channel, adding that U.S. exports to China will double under the agreement.
Under the trade agreement announced last week, Washington will reduce some tariffs on Chinese imports in exchange for Chinese purchases of agricultural, manufactured and energy products increasing by about $20 billion over the next two years. While Washington has touted the deal, Chinese officials have been more cautious, emphasizing that the trade dispute has not been completely settled.
The bullish trade news also benefited other higher-risk securities, including U.S. stocks, which recorded all-time highs, with the Dow (DJI) passing its November closing high and the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (IXIC) marking record closes for the third straight session.
Safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasury yields were hit, driving the spread between U.S. corporate and government bonds tighter.
The spread of U.S. investment-grade credit yields over safer Treasuries was just 105 basis points at the close of trade on Friday, the tightest since March 2018, according to the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA corporate index < .MERC0A0>.

Boeing's 737 MAX, which is made in Seattle, was grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The production freeze by one of the largest U.S. exporters is expected to impact suppliers, airlines and financiers across the globe, as well as the U.S. economy."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks notched record closing highs on Monday as cooling trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and upbeat economic data from China boosted investor sentiment.
The Dow surpassed its November closing high, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq marked record closes for the third straight session.
Friday's announcement of an interim trade deal between the world's two biggest economies has lifted prospects for the global economy, several analysts said. Although growth in China is expected to continue moderating, the trade developments brightened the country's economic outlook.
Adding to the optimism, data released early on Monday showed China's industrial output and retail sales growth accelerated in November.
The U.S.-China trade deal suspended tariffs scheduled to take effect on Dec. 15 on a variety of consumer products, including Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iPhone. Apple shares rose 1.7% and provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (IXIC). 
Shares of chipmakers, among the most trade-sensitive stocks, also rose. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (SOX) gained 1.0%.
""It validates the best-case scenario people were expecting,"" Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York, said of the removal of tariffs.
Accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve this year and mostly encouraging U.S. economic data have also helped push Wall Street stocks to record levels. The benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) is up more than 27% this year and on track for its highest annual percentage gain in six years.
""The Fed is increasing the size of its balance sheet, and that generally translates to a good equity market,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago. ""I'm not sure we need much more.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 100.51 points, or 0.36%, to 28,235.89, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 22.65 points, or 0.71%, to 3,191.45 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 79.35 points, or 0.91%, to 8,814.23.
Shares of UnitedHealth Group (N:UNH) and  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN) jumped after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) added both companies to its ""conviction list."" UnitedHealth shares rose 2.3%, and Amgen shares moved 2.7% higher.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) shares fell 4.3%, limiting gains on the Dow, on reports that the planemaker was considering whether to cut or halt production of its grounded 737 MAX aircraft.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.39-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.65-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 77 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 225 new highs and 54 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.48 billion shares, compared with the 6.85 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 03:33PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC settles with former Goldman banker over 1MDB scandal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has settled foreign corruption charges against former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) executive Tim Leissner for his involvement in Malaysia's multibillion-dollar 1MDB corruption scandal, the agency said on Monday. 
The SEC has permanently barred Leissner from the securities industry for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by allegedly receiving more than $43 million in illicit payments for helping to facilitate a bribery scheme involving high-ranking government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. 
As part of the settlement, Leissner consented to the SEC's order that he violated antibribery, internal accounting controls, and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. 
The settlement also requires Leissner to give up ill-gotten gains of $43.7 million. 
That amount will be offset by money paid as part of an action by the U.S. Department of Justice, which in November 2018 filed criminal charges against Leissner and fellow former Goldman banker Roger Ng. Leissner pleaded guilty to those charges. Ng pleaded not guilty, and his case is pending in federal court in Brooklyn.
Goldman has been investigated by regulators in at least 14 countries, including the United States, Malaysia and Singapore, over its involvement in the scandal. According to the Justice Department, the bank earned $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue. 
The bank has consistently tried to distance itself from the scandal, saying Leissner and Ng worked to conceal their criminal activities from the bank's management. 

Both bankers have already been sanctioned by U.S. Federal Reserve for their roles in the scandal.

That’s equivalent to about 1.25% of the former British colony’s gross domestic product, the U.K. central bank said in its semiannual Financial Stability Report on Monday, citing its own calculations and data from Refinitiv and EPFR Global.
 HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc, among the biggest foreign-based lenders in Hong Kong, have said that they have seen wealthy customers in the territory opening overseas bank accounts as fears have grown since anti-government protests began in April.
The Bank of England is particularly concerned by events in Hong Kong because of the outsized exposure of British banks. U.K. lenders’ current combined exposure to the territory totals about 160% of their common equity Tier 1 capital, the BOE said."

AMF said in a statement Bloomberg should have known the information in the press release was false.
Bloomberg News, which competes with Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI), said it intended to lodge an appeal.
""We regret that the AMF did not find and punish the perpetrator of the hoax, and chose instead to penalize a media outlet that was doing its very best to report on what appeared to be newsworthy information,"" a spokesman for Bloomberg News said.
On Nov. 22, 2016, Vinci shares lost as much as 18% following the hoax statement that said the group would revise its 2015 and 2016 accounts and fire its chief financial officer.
The AMF said it had taken action against Bloomberg because it had published the hoax statement without verifying it.
Vinci shares recovered after the company denied the report and said the statement was a hoax.

After the hoax statement, Vinci filed a legal complaint to the AMF.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 01:37PM ET</span>",Tyson Foods cleared to ship poultry to China from all U.S. plants,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) received approval from U.S. and Chinese authorities to export American poultry to China from all 36 of its U.S. processing plants and expects to begin taking orders early next year, a chief supply chain officer for the company said.
U.S. chicken companies are eager to resume sales in China after Beijing last month lifted a nearly five-year ban on imports as Chinese consumers seek pork alternatives. A deadly hog disease has killed millions of pigs and raised meat prices in the pork-loving country.
Increased Chinese purchases of products like chicken feet, wing tips and legs would help increase U.S. agricultural exports to China as the two countries negotiate a trade deal.
""There's an extreme amount of interest across all those parts from multiple buyers in China,"" Bernie Adcock, Tyson Foods' chief supply chain officer for poultry, said in an interview on Friday.
The U.S. Trade Representative last month projected more than $1 billion in annual poultry shipments to China.
Beijing banned U.S. poultry and eggs in January 2015 over a U.S. outbreak of avian flu, closing a market that bought $500 million worth of American poultry products in 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
China is scouring the globe for meat and poultry after African swine fever killed about half of the world's largest hog herd.
U.S. meat companies have faced a disadvantage for pork exports to China, compared to other suppliers, because Beijing imposed tariffs of up to 72% on American pork as part of the countries' trade war. Tyson, the largest U.S. meat producer, expects China to import more U.S. pork and poultry to compensate for African swine fever's toll.
""My gut is they're going to buy a lot of both,"" Adcock said.
China is an important market for chicken parts that many U.S. consumers do not eat. During China's ban, companies including Tyson and Sanderson Farms Inc rendered some feet for products like fertilizer and pet food, instead of exporting them for higher returns.
Tyson is working to win U.S. approval by the end of the year for labels on poultry exported to China, the final step. It received its first label approval on Friday, Adcock said.
Processing plants run by Sanderson, Pilgrim's Pride Corp and other companies also have been cleared to ship U.S. poultry to China, according to USDA.
Tyson will probably not ship poultry to China from all its plants, Adcock said."

The shares were down 4% at 1:20 PM ET (18:20 GMT), the biggest loser among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrials. The loss cut the gain for the index by about 92 points. The index was up 162 points.
The company's board was holding a two-day meeting in Chicago, with the 737 Max question on the agenda. The company's management has proposed halting production until the plane is recertified. A decision may be announced after Monday's market close or early Tuesday, reports said.
Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration said it won't recertify the plane as ready to return to regular service this year. Boeing (NYSE:BA) had said it expected to win FAA approval by the end of the month.
The FAA offered no timetable on when the recertification will come. Regulators elsewhere, especially in Europe and China, may take longer to approve the fixes.
The 737 Max has been grounded since March after two planes crashed in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killing 346 people. Evidence has indicated the crashes were due to a malfunctioning system designed to help the plane avoid stalls.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares hit an all-time high of $446.01 on March 1, nine days before the Ethiopia crash, and have fallen more than 26% since. Although Boeing has continued to build new planes at its plant in Renton, Wa., outside Seattle, finished planes are stored on tarmacs in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere."
1541,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 01:17PM ET</span>",Argo takes different road to skirt self-driving challenges,"By Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman
PITTSBURGH/DETROIT (Reuters) - Sky's the limit optimism about self-driving cars is giving way to tougher questions about how expensive automotive artificial intelligence will ever make a profit.
Those are questions the founders of Argo AI - and automaker partners Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) - are betting they can answer by taking a different road than more highly valued rivals. 
The self-driving systems developer led by Bryan Salesky, who got his start developing automated vehicles for a Defense Department sponsored competition 12 years ago, is at the center of a multibillion-dollar bet by its auto giant partners that autonomous vehicle technology must be good for more than replacing taxi drivers. 
""I hate the word robotaxi,"" Salesky said in a rare interview at Argo's Pittsburgh headquarters. ""There are so many applications and businesses to be built, and (try to) understand which ones are more profitable than others.""
Argo is not building vehicles, and does not plan to operate its own mobility services. Instead, the Argo business plan hinges on a unique revenue-sharing deal that will pay Argo fees based on miles traveled in self-driving Ford and VW vehicles equipped with Argo's technology. Details of that arrangement have not previously been reported.
Argo's financial structure is also different from rival autonomous vehicle ventures. Ford and VW each own just under 40%, with Argo's management team holding just over 20%, according to sources familiar with the business. Details of the ownership structure also have not previously been reported.
Among the prospective commercial applications of Argo's technology: Long-haul trucking, e-commerce deliveries, the transport of people along fixed routes in cities, and off-highway applications such as mining. 
Founded in Pittsburgh in late 2016 by Michigan natives Salesky and Chief Operating Officer Peter Rander, Argo is headquartered in a nondescript building in The Strip, an old warehouse and market district overlooking the Allegheny River. 
Argo's main rivals focused initially on deploying robotaxis. Waymo, however, is now working on adapting its automated ""driver"" to commercial vehicles, including Class 8 trucks, Waymo Chief Executive John Krafcik said.
Argo's plan is to provide automated driving systems that Ford will use to launch services in late 2021 in three U.S. cities, likely using a compact shuttle based on the redesigned Ford Transit Connect.
VW executives revealed to Reuters they expect to follow in 2022 or 2023 with a VW-designed all-electric vehicle, which could be deployed initially in the German automaker's Moia ride services business.
Ford executive Jim Farley said at a Detroit conference in November the No. 2 U.S. automaker was exploring applications for Argo's technology ""that could make more sense than robotaxis,"" including automated materials deliveries to trades people via a subscription service.
In addition to deploying Argo-outfitted vehicles in its own ride services fleet, VW has received interest from other ride hailing and transportation companies in buying VW vehicles equipped with Argo's system, said Thomas Sedran, head of VW Commercial Vehicles and the automaker's autonomous vehicles initiative.
That could be another way for Argo and its partners to make money as the technology finds its way into more vehicles and the number of miles traveled multiplies.
""The details, the concrete conditions, how many cents per mile are we talking about or what's the share of revenue? That's still open,"" Sedran said. ""At this stage, we are still working on making that technology generate revenue.""
Salesky said Argo's self-driving technology can be adapted to a variety of vehicle types, sizes and applications: ""This is going to be a multi-stage thing where there are going to be a number of different platforms and potentially different businesses.""
Some rivals are not convinced Argo has any advantage.
""We didn't start from scratch,"" said Glen De Vos, chief technology officer of Aptiv, which has bolstered its own expertise through acquisitions of self-driving startups nuTonomy and Ottomatika.
De Vos pointed to Aptiv's partnership with  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) in testing self-driving vehicles in the latter's Las Vegas ride hailing network, and said Argo ""doesn't have the component engineering capability that Aptiv has.""
Investors so far have assigned Argo a lower valuation than robotaxi-focused rivals. Waymo is valued at $105 billion, while Cruise had a valuation of $19 billion at its last funding round. 
Argo's valuation is estimated at $7.25 billion following Volkswagen's $1.9 billion investment, matching the $7.25 billion valuation of Uber (NYSE:UBER) Technologies' Advanced Technologies Group, the ride services company's self-driving unit.
Salesky said he and Rander are open to bringing other investor-partners into the business: ""The more diversity, the better — but it needs to complement the portfolio that we're already building with Ford and VW.""

""But we know that this is really the early days,"" he added. ""The ballgame hasn't really started.""

(Reuters) - German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE's (DE:PSMGn) e-commerce arm NuCom Group is exploring the acquisition of U.S. livestreaming app developer Meet Group Inc (O:MEET), people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
NuCom, whose holdings include online dating website eharmony, has made a preliminary expression of interest to buy Meet Group, the sources said, cautioning there is no certainty there will be negotiations that lead to a deal.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Meet Group and Prosieben declined to comment.
Meet Group shares rose as much 21% on the news, and were trading up 9% at $5.52 in the afternoon session in New York on Monday, giving the company a market value of $400 million.
Based in New Hope, Pennsylvania, Meet Group is a maker of internet-based apps that enable livestreaming broadcasts and text-based conversations, including  MeetMe , LOVOO, Skout, Tagged and Growlr.
Meet Group has struggled to challenge the dominant U.S. dating app developer,  Match Group Inc  (O:MTCH). It is focusing on expanding its live-streaming platforms, modeled after the video products offered by Asian dating app providers.
Prosieben has looked to Nucom to diversify its legacy free-to-air TV business and expand its internet and social media portfolio. NuCom spans dating site Parship, energy price comparison portal Verivox and Jochen Schweizer, which sells vouchers for ""experiences"" like tandem parachute jumps.
Last year, investment firm General Atlantic acquired a 25.1% stake in NuCom from Prosieben at a 1.8 billion euro ($2 billion) valuation. It increased its stake slightly in 2019."

Trump, in a tweet Friday, again raised the prospect of a “massive new trade deal” after the U.K. leaves the European Union.
The U.S. and China last week agreed to the first phase of a broader trade agreement that will see Trump reduce tariffs on Chinese goods, at least temporarily calming fears of an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

The Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico is at the heart of the shale boom that has helped the United States become the world's biggest crude oil producer.
The deal gives WPX access to Felix's about 1,500 gross undeveloped locations in the eastern part of the Delaware basin, with projected production of about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d).
""The transaction we've announced this morning checks all the boxes for us,"" WPX Chief Executive Officer Richard Muncrief said on a conference call.
The company said it expects to spend in the range of $1.68 billion to $1.80 billion as pro forma development capital for 2020, once the deal closes.
Overall, the deal ""looks favorable for WPX at first blush"", Piper Jaffray analysts said, as the company is increasing Delaware scale at an attractive valuation and gradually pivoting away from the Williston basin, which was poised to exhaust inventory in the coming years at the current pace of activity.
The deal is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2020 and consists of $900 million in cash and $1.6 billion in WPX stock.
WPX said it would add two members to its board from EnCap Investments LP, the private equity company that founded Felix. 
The company said it has obtained committed financing from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) for the deal and has access to a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. 
This acquisition of a large private equity funded E&P by a public company is reminiscent of the Permian land rush in 2016-2017, when public companies were rapidly building up inventory, said Enverus analyst Andrew Dittmar.
WPX also expects pro forma production of more than 240,000 boe/d at about 64% oil, after the deal closes.

Barclays and Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co are financial advisers to WPX and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP the legal adviser, while Jefferies LLC is the financial adviser to Felix and Vinson & Elkins LLP the legal adviser.

(Reuters) - Developers of a Texas rare earths mine said on Monday they will build a pilot plant to refine the strategic minerals, the latest domestic processing project announced at a time when more Americans are voicing concern about China's control over the sector.
China is the largest global processor of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals used to make a range of electronics and military equipment.
Texas Mineral Resources Corp (PK:TMRC) and privately held USA Rare Earth said they will spend $10 million to $12 million to build the pilot plant in Colorado, near industry consultants and academics.
The partners hope to be producing small amounts of processed rare earths by the middle of 2020 - roughly 100 kilograms (220 pounds) annually. This would help them finalize supply deals with potential customers and secure financing for a full-scale plant near their Round Top mine in rural west Texas.
The partners plan to move the pilot plant to Texas by 2021 and have full-scale production by 2023.
California's Mountain Pass mine, which is controlled by a hedge fund, is building its own rare earth processing equipment and hopes to have it online by next year.
Australia's  Lynas Corp  (AX:LYC) earlier this year signed a memorandum of understanding to build a U.S. rare earth processing facility with privately-held Blue  Line Corp  (NYSE:LN).
Separately, the U.S. military has launched plans to fund construction of rare earths processing facilities, according to government documents seen by Reuters, part of an urgent push by Washington to secure domestic supply of the minerals. The military has already extended the deadline to apply for funding three times.
Texas Mineral Resources and USA Rare Earth did apply for funding from the U.S. military, though they said such funding is not needed to build out their pilot plant.
""We don't want to sit and wait,"" said Pini Althaus, chief executive of USA Rare Earth, an Australian investment group previously known as Morzev Pty Ltd before changing its name last year. ""There's a sense of urgency around the need for a (rare earths) processing facility that's not in China.""
The facility will process so-called light rare earths as well as heavy rare earths, a less-common type of the specialized minerals that are highly sought after for use in weaponry."

(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) on Monday said it has asked a U.S. federal appeals court to throw out a $25 million judgment it was ordered to pay to a California man who blamed the company's Roundup weed killer for his cancer.
In a filing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit dated Friday, Bayer said the verdict defied regulatory findings and sound science, adding that the ""speculative case"" should never have made it before a jury.
Bayer in a statement said it stood behind the safety of Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate and planned to vigorously defend the more than 42,700 U.S. Roundup cancer lawsuits it faces. 
In its court filing, Bayer said the Hardeman appeal had the potential to shape how every subsequent Roundup case is litigated.
The widely-used weed killer is made by  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which Bayer acquired last year for $63 billion. Bayer stock has lost about 23% in value since the first Roundup verdict for plaintiffs in August 2018. 
The case on appeal before the 9th Circuit involved the claims of Edwin Hardeman, which was the third Roundup case to go to trial in a U.S. court. A jury in March ordered Monsanto to pay $80 million in damages, saying Roundup had caused the man's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The trial court judge in July reduced that verdict to $25 million.
Lawyers for Hardeman on Monday did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Bayer's appeal. 
The lawyers during the trial argued Monsanto had failed to warn consumers of Roundup's cancer risk and said the company concealed damaging evidence from public and regulatory view. Bayer rejects those allegations.
The German company's main appeal argument in Hardeman's case centers on repeated findings by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that glyphosate is not a carcinogen and not a risk to public health when used in accordance with its current label.
Bayer argued it would be impossible to comply with the Hardeman verdict, a lawsuit brought under state law, because any warning label would be in conflict with guidance from a federal agency. 
Some legal experts consider this preemption defense a ""silver bullet"" because it would stop claims across the board, but said the argument faced big hurdles on appeal. 

The company also said the trial judge had committed ""a host of errors"" by allowing jurors to hear unreliable expert testimony.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 11:45AM ET</span>",Stocks of Boeing and its suppliers fall on reports of 737 MAX production halt,"(Reuters) - Shares of Boeing (N:BA) and its suppliers fell on Monday after reports that the U.S. planemaker could temporarily halt production of 737 MAX aircraft, potentially adding to billions of dollars in costs, as its return to service is pushed to 2020.
The best-selling Boeing plane has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people, costing the plane manufacturer more than $9 billion in charges so far.
Boeing's shares fell 4% in premarket trading to $328.13, while Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR) fell 3.4%. Spirit is Boeing's biggest supplier and makes the MAX fuselage along with other parts such as pylons.
Analysts say a suspension of MAX production would likely result in significant additional charges for Boeing as well as it main suppliers, who have been shielded from a financial hit as they have continued to sell parts for the jet at a rate of up to 52 units per month, even as the planemaker has cut its own production to 42 per month.
""We would highlight Spirit AeroSystems,  Safran  SA (PA:SAF) and Senior Plc (L:SNR) as names that could potentially experience greater disruption impacts if production is indeed slowed further or halted,"" Berenberg analyst Andrew Gollan said.
Two suppliers told Reuters on Monday that Boeing was likely to halt assembly of the 737 MAX jet for the time being, though some suppliers could be asked to keep producing to minimize disruption.
CFM International, a joint venture between Safran and  General Electric  Co (N:GE) supplies engines to the MAX. Safran fell 1.5%, while shares of GE were up 0.5%.
Shares of British engineering firm Senior Plc were also up 2%. The company makes a wide variety of aircraft components and counts Boeing as one of its top customers.
The largest U.S. planemaker's board of directors is holding a two-day meeting in Chicago, which started on Sunday, to consider 737 MAX production changes, Reuters reported citing a person briefed on the matter.

Boeing could make an announcement on production plans as soon as late Monday, and this follows the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration comments last week that it would not approve the plane's return to service before 2020.

1554,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 10:08AM ET</span>",PG&E Plunges as It Races to Meet Governor Bankruptcy Demand,"(Bloomberg) -- Pacific Gas & Electric Co (NYSE:PCG) shares plummeted after California Governor Gavin Newsom rejected its bankruptcy restructuring plan, forcing the company to make sweeping changes to meet his demands.
The state’s largest power company has until Tuesday to address conditions that Newsom laid out in a letter late last week rejecting its reorganization proposal. The governor said the current plan falls “woefully short” of meeting requirements of a key state law and insisted on changes that could reshape PG&E, including an entirely new board and the option for a takeover.
The company’s shares fell as much as 23% in New York. Its most actively traded bonds rose as Newsom’s move bolsters a rival reorganization plan proposed by a group of bondholders.
Newsom’s rebuke upends PG&E’s restructuring just as the path toward a smooth exit next year seemed to be clearing. The San Francisco-based company, in bankruptcy after its equipment caused massive wildfires, earlier this month reached a $13.5 billion settlement with victims of the blazes. The deal, however, is dependent on the governor’s support and his determination that the reorganization complies with a state law that would provide financial assistance for future fire costs.
“His list of demands might be hard for the company to accept, putting the whole Chapter 11 timeline in jeopardy,” said Jared Ellias, a bankruptcy law professor at the University of California, Hastings. “He could have asked for something akin to changing the drapes. Instead it’s more like he is asking them to change their floor plan.”
In his letter to PG&E Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson, Newsom said the bankruptcy resolution “must yield a radically restructured and transformed utility that is responsible and accountable.” He called for a better financial plan, clearly defined safety metrics and a “streamlined process” for a state or third-party takeover if warranted. He also said he doesn’t expect that the post-confirmation board will include any current directors.
PG&E said its plan meets state law and “is the best course forward for all stakeholders.”
“We’ve welcomed feedback from all stakeholders throughout these proceedings and will continue to work diligently in the coming days to resolve any issues that may arise,” the company said in a statement Friday.
Under the settlement agreement, the company has to modify the plan in a manner “acceptable to the governor” by Tuesday.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“California Governor Gavin Newsom’s broad objections to PG&E’s exit plan may require substantial changes in financial and governance structures.”
-- Kit Konolige, Senior utilities analyst
Click here to view the research.
Newsom, who took office just weeks before PG&E filed the largest-ever utility bankruptcy in January, faces political pressure to show dramatic changes. The company’s role in deadly wildfires has provoked widespread public outrage, which was exacerbated in October after a series of mass blackouts designed to keep its power lines from sparking blazes during dry, windy conditions. The governor threatened a state takeover of the company after the outages if it couldn’t improve its operations.
“After the company exits bankruptcy, Newsom really needs it to succeed,” Ellias said. “It could put his entire career as governor in jeopardy if this company isn’t successful.”
A recent poll by the University of California at Berkeley showed that a majority of the state’s voters are in favor of changing the way PG&E operates, with one-third wanting an end to it as an investor-owned utility.
Already, a California lawmaker is planning to introduce legislation that would turn PG&E into a government-owned utility. And a group of mayors and local officials have floated a proposal to make it a customer-owned cooperative.
Rival Bid
Newsom’s demands could give a boost to Elliott Management Corp., Pacific Investment Management Co. and the other bond holders proposing the alternative restructuring strategy. It calls for injecting $20 billion in cash into PG&E in exchange for most of the equity in the company.
PG&E’s 6.05% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2034 gained about 1.2 cents on the dollar to 107.7 cents at 9:24 a.m. in New York, according to Trace bond price data.
In a statement Thursday, Elliott blasted PG&E’s own restructuring proposal, saying it would saddle the company with an additional $10 billion in debt, limit its safety investments and turn the utility into a “junk-bond issuer.”
In his letter, Newsom raised similar concerns that PG&E’s debt-heavy plan wouldn’t allow for the company to make billions of dollars of needed safety investments.
“All of this contributes to a reorganized company, that, in my judgment, will not be positioned to provide safe, reliable, affordable electric service,” he said."

Treasuries fell.
The S&P 500 Index gained in the wake of the agreement announced Dec. 13 that will see Washington reduce tariffs and Beijing increase purchases of American farm goods, although many details are still to be ironed out. In another positive sign, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s survey measure of general business conditions in the next six months jumped to a five-month high. The dollar retreated.
The Stoxx Europe 600 became the latest major equity gauge to hit a new peak as it jumped for a fourth day, led by gains in financial and industrial shares. Stocks were mixed in Asia. Equities in Shanghai rose after Chinese data showed industrial output and retail sales both exceeded expectations.
The pound strengthened, though it trimmed gains after U.K. factories posted the weakest performance in more than seven years. European bonds mostly edged higher.
The announcement of the preliminary U.S.-China deal staved off a scheduled Dec. 15 tariff hike, a prospect that had loomed large for markets. It remains unclear how China will follow through on pledges to boost American agricultural imports, and how quickly the U.S. promise to roll back half of a September tariff hike will happen.
“Now that the ‘good news’ is here, what is next for stocks? This week should be the last week with any decent volume as investors head for home for Christmas and the New Year’s holiday,” Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, wrote to clients. “Slow volume should also mean modest moves in stocks, so investors should be able to sleep easy and dream of sugar plum fairies to close out a very good year.”
China’s threat of retaliation against Germany if it excludes Huawei Technologies Co. as a supplier of 5G wireless equipment shows tensions remain high elsewhere.

The brokerage raised its rating to ""buy"" from ""underperform"" - its first-ever double upgrade for BAT - citing reduced near-term U.S. regulatory risk and a more favorable competitive vaping environment for the Newport and Dunhill cigarette maker.
""The company is taking the right actions, shifting away from the status quo of a traditional tobacco company, recognizing the challenges faced in NGPs (new generation products) and implementing the right strategic decisions to compete more eﬀectively in the new fast-evolving world of tobacco,"" analyst Mirco Badocco wrote in the note.
BAT's shares rose as much as 5% to 3,198 pence in morning trading after BofA also raised its share price objective to 3,400 pence from 2,500 pence.
Badocco also cheered Chief Executive Officer Jack Bowles' moves to slim down the company, including removing duplicate processes and 20% of its senior managers and consolidating brands within its new generation products (NGP) portfolio of e-cigarettes and heat not burn vaping products.
""If implemented in the right way...all of this has a big potential to make BAT much more agile and faster in decision making, which has been a key drag for the company in the fast-changing world of NGPs,"" Badocco said.
Tobacco companies have made huge bets on e-cigarettes to counter declining sales of traditional cigarettes, but alarm bells have been raised over their safety following a spate of vaping-related lung injuries and deaths in the United States.
However, the health fears have made the competitive environment more favorable for BAT, the brokerage said, as rivals such as Altria-backed Juul, which have held a strong lead over BAT for years, scale down marketing investments.
BAT would also see near-term benefits from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's moves to delay its decision to reduce nicotine levels and ban menthol cigarettes for at least the next 12 months as it focuses on curbing the vaping crisis.
A ban on menthol products, especially, would be damaging for BAT as it controls 55% of the U.S. menthol market from which it makes 60% of its U.S. revenue, Badocco said.
The current average analyst rating on the stock is ""buy,"" with a median analyst price target of 3,600 pence, according to Refinitiv data."

The company, previously known as Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:BHC), did not admit to any liability and denied all allegations of wrongdoing as part of the settlement for the litigation originally filed in October 2015. 
Bausch Health said it intends to use a combination of sources to fund the settlement, which may include cash on hand, its revolving credit facility and potentially accessing capital markets.
The settlement, subject to court approval, does not impact the company's 2019 financial forecast and will not diminish its ability to continue to invest in its businesses, Bausch Health said.
The drugmaker has sought to get past a series of scandals and accounting issues under previous management.
Valeant had faced multiple probes into business practices, including its ties to the now-defunct specialty pharmacy Philidor, which began drawing scrutiny in October 2015.
This lead to a steep fall in share price that was compounded by concerns about the company's heavy debt load, which stood at $23.84 billion as of Sept. 30.

""Policy clarity"" after the U.S.-China trade deal and the British elections could trigger commodity demand, analysts at the bank said in a note.
""However, the structural supply problems that have discouraged investment in commodity production remain: poor company returns, too much debt and environmental liabilities"".
Washington and Beijing cooled their trade war last week, reducing some U.S. tariffs in exchange for what U.S. officials said would be a big jump in Chinese purchases of U.S. farm products and other goods.
After winning a majority in the UK election last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to ""get Brexit done"" by Jan. 31 and then agree a new trade deal with the European Union by the end of 2020.
Goldman forecast returns of 1.7%, 4.7% and 6.4% on its S&P GSCI commodity index for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months, respectively. Over the 12-month horizon, Goldman saw returns of 9.1% from energy, 7.7% for precious metals, and 7.9% for the livestock sector.
Benchmark Brent crude oil prices (LCOc1) have rallied this year, supported by production curbs by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, who this month agreed to lower output by a further 500,000 barrels per day as of Jan. 1. [O/R]
""As the focus becomes very near-term and open-ended, the cuts to production could be deeper with OPEC delivering credible and observable threats to 'cheaters',"" the bank said.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 09:01AM ET</span>",Costco in Caracas: how Florida goods flood Venezuelan stores,"By Shaylim Valderrama and Sarah Kinosian
CARACAS/MIAMI (Reuters) - While U.S. President Donald Trump wants to drive Venezuela's socialist ruler out of power with economic sanctions, there has in fact been a burgeoning influx of American-bought goods from Nutella spread to Oreo cookies. 
Many toiletries, food items and other imports became impossible to find during Venezuela's economic implosion under President Nicolas Maduro. Yet now they line the shelves in scores of new U.S. dollar-only shops known as ""bodegones"", providing an unlikely safety valve for Maduro.
The reason?
Venezuelan businessmen have taken advantage of his government's quiet abandonment of price, currency and import controls to buy direct from U.S. wholesalers including Costco (O:COST) and Walmart (N:WMT).
The goods are delivered to Florida-based door-to-door services run by Venezuelans, according to 11 interviews with customs agents, operators and businessmen. The products move in bulk via shipping companies with bases in south Florida who have this year enjoyed a 100% exemption of import duties and waiver of some paperwork at the Venezuelan end, the sources added.
""Everything our customers want from the United Sates, we've managed to offer here!"" enthused Hector Mambel, who runs a ""bodegon"" in Puerto Cabello port with a ""Mini Walmart"" sign outside using the same design as the U.S. giant he buys from.
The shift shows how Venezuela's economy is evolving to survive sanctions that have hit oil exports. 
The trade from Florida does not violate Trump's sanctions because they target business with Maduro's government not with private entrepreneurs. It has, however, bemused some Venezuelans used to constant ""anti-imperialist"" rhetoric.
""I don't understand this government that speaks ill of the 'gringos' and yet we now see U.S. products abound in stores and everything is in dollars,"" said teacher Ligia Martinez, 38, holding a bag with purchases of cereal, tuna and cake mix.
She bought the goods at a ""bodegon"" in the city of Valencia with dollar remittances sent from family abroad.
It was only last year, as the local bolivar currency depreciated precipitously amid hyperinflation, that Maduro lifted a longstanding prohibition on dollar transactions.
Though the goods in the corner-shops are out of reach for most bolivar-earning Venezuelans, a well-heeled elite with dollars makes for a viable business in indulgence products.
""I SELL EVERYTHING""
The ""bodegones"" are reminiscent of the dollar-only stores communist Cuba ran for foreigners in the 1990s.
Reuters found 120 new such stores in Caracas alone, primarily in middle class areas, outnumbering the 27 bolivar supermarkets in those areas. Competition has brought down the price of niche-market items such as boutique hair products.
The abundance on shelves contrasts with years of scarcity of basics from shampoo to milk borne out of socialist regulations that often forced merchants to sell below cost.
""Bodegon"" owners often buy online or partner with door-to-door services who scour chains for knock-down prices. 
""Our customers ask us to buy at Costco or (Walmart affiliate) Sam's Club in the United States and we import what they ask for them,"" said an operator of a shipping company that brings supplies from Miami to Caracas. 
At least half of the stores Reuters visited sold products from Members Mark, which is Sam's Club's private brand, and Costco's Kirkland brand. Popular items include pancake mix, Pringles, ketchup and cereal, often selling for double or more their U.S. price.
Some of the ""bodegones"" buy from wholesale importers, meaning they have to hike prices further for margins, so pancake mix for $6.50 or thereabouts in Costco goes for $14 to $20 in Venezuela depending on how many hands it has been through.
Some Venezuelans offer imports direct via Instagram. 
""Everything I bring from Miami, I sell,"" said one small online merchant, noting his compatriots' love of foreign goods. ""There's more competition these days, but it's still good business because Venezuelans are snobbish.""
Costco declined to comment, while Walmart did not respond to a request. Venezuela's Information Ministry, tax authority and state port agency also did not respond to requests for comment.
Asked for its view of the trade, given the underlying aim of sanctions, the U.S. Treasury Department did not respond.
This year's waiver of import duties and some documentation has been a boon to businessmen, used to crippling bureaucracy and regulations for years. ""These imports move with ease, everything is exempted,"" said one trader, who brings in products at La Guaira port outside Caracas.
The exemptions expire this month but may be extended.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets rose on Monday, trading a notch below a record high hit last week on the back of a preliminary trade deal agreed between the United States and China.
European shares built on the previous week's gains. By midday in London, the pan-European STOXX 600 index was up by 1.2% and touched a record high. Germany's DAX rose 0.6%.
Britain's FTSE 100 index was up 1.14%, moving in tandem with a buoyant pound that rose 0.3%, adding to gains last week on the back of a landslide victory for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party in the UK election. 
U.S. stock futures also pointed to stronger gains to start the week, with the S&P 500 e-minis up 0.36%.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Sunday a deal was ""totally done"", notwithstanding some needed revisions, and would nearly double U.S. exports to China over the next two years.
The ""phase one"" agreement suspended a threatened round of U.S. tariffs on a $160 billion list of Chinese imports that was scheduled to take effect on Sunday. The United States also agreed to halve the tariff rate, to 7.5%, on $120 billion worth of Chinese goods.
""It's good news but we can't celebrate yet,"" said Mark Mobius, founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners. 
""There's going to be a lot more going forward. This agreement is dependent on the degree to which the Chinese comply. This conversation will continue as there's so many issues. It's not just about trade. Its about technical issues, know-how, technology...So there'll be a continuing situation."" 
The 17-month-old trade dispute between the world's two largest economies has buffeted financial markets and taken a toll on global economic growth.
Euro zone business growth remained weak in December, with tepid foreign demand exacerbating a contraction in manufacturing and offsetting a slight pick-up in services activity, although some analysts saw signs of stabilization.
Positive sentiment helped push MSCI's All Country World Index up 0.25%. The index, which tracks stocks across 47 countries, reached an all-time high on Friday when the trade deal was agreed.
Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan to its highest level since April 18. It was last up 0.14%.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 led the way as it jumped 1.63%, while shares in Taiwan added 0.1%. 
Japan's Nikkei 225 succumbed to some profit-taking, falling 0.29% after surging 2.55% to a 14-month closing high on Friday.
Ryan Felsman, senior economist at CommSec in Sydney, said the trade deal and the receding risk of a disorderly Brexit after the British election yielded a strong Conservative majority provided support for sentiment in Australia. 
A lower-than-expected Australian budget surplus due to a sluggish economy has also ""built expectations by markets for further easing from the Reserve Bank (of Australia)"", he said.
Chinese investors initially had a more tepid reaction to the trade news, with the blue-chip CSI300 index struggling to rise further after trade hopes fanned a near 2% rise on Friday.
But after a lackluster morning session, the CSI300 index turned higher and was last up 0.5%, helped by data showing the country's industrial output growth and retail sales jumped more than expected in November.
Felsman at CommSec said investors wanted more details and the reduction in U.S. tariffs may have disappointed some looking for more aggressive action.
""Certainly there were expectations perhaps that the rollback would be more significant than just 50%,"" he said.
U.S. shares had struck a cautious note on Friday, paring initial gains to end barely higher as weary investors awaited signs of a concrete deal.
However, the news of a deal was still enough to send the S&P 500 to a record closing high of 3,168.8, up 0.01%. 
The Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% to end at 8,734.88, also a record, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.01% to 28,135.38.
U.S. Treasury yields moved higher on Monday, reflecting a more positive mood. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.8452% compared with their U.S. close of 1.821% on Friday, and the two-year yield touched 1.6304% compared with a U.S. close of 1.604%.
The dollar was slightly higher against the yen at 109.45 and the euro was up 0.22% at $1.1144.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.19% at 96.984.
Oil prices, which had risen on Friday following the China-U.S. deal, hovered near three-month highs. Brent crude was higher by 0.3% at $65.35 per barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was flat at $60.05 per barrel.

Spot gold prices were flat at $1,476.10 per ounce.

Shares in the world's second-biggest apparel group were up 2% at 1000 GMT, outperforming the wider market in Stockholm (OMXSPI).
They have now climbed 53% this year on hopes the group has embarked on a road to recovery after slowing footfall at its core H&M-branded stores caused years of sliding group profits, mounting inventories and shrinking market value.
Over the past few years the Swedish-based retailer has invested in online services, new store concepts and independent brands to broaden its customer base and turn itself around.
H&M said its sales in September-November, its fourth quarter, were held back by the Black Friday shopping day falling later this year.
It said sales for the quarter rose 9% to 61.7 billion crowns ($6.41 billion). Analysts had forecast a 10% rise, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimates.
In local currencies, growth was 5%.
""Black Friday this year fell a week later, i.e. just before the end of the month of November,"" H&M said in a statement. 
""Therefore some of the big Black Friday online sales will not be recognized until December. The amount in question is
expected to be approximately 500 million crowns.""
H&M said that adjusted for that, sales grew 10%, or 6% in local currencies and analysts said that stripping out the Black Friday impact, sales broadly matched expectations.
Rival  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the world's biggest clothing retailer and owner of the Zara chain, said last week its net profit grew 14% in the three months through October, helped by sales growth of 9% according to Reuters' calculation and shrinking inventories. 
RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain, with an ""outperform"" rating on H&M's shares, said H&M's sales figures indicated the retailer had gained share in major markets such as Germany, H&M's biggest market, where industry-wide in-store sales shrank by an estimated 4%. 
In the third quarter, H&M had increased profit for the first time in more than two years as heavy spending to meet changes in the market helped sales reach 8% growth in local currencies - a pace last seen three years ago.
Analysts expect full-year profits to grow for the first time since 2015, despite still-high inventory and investment levels.
H&M, which is controlled by the founding Persson family, is scheduled to publish its full earnings report on Jan. 30.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 07:26AM ET</span>",Wall Street banks court moderate Democrats to blunt Warren's hostility,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street bank lobbyists are seeking moderate Democratic allies in Congress to deprive Elizabeth Warren of votes and curb policies they consider hostile to their interests, according to more than a dozen lobbyists, consultants and campaign data.
A leading Democratic 2020 presidential hopeful and fiery progressive, Warren has built her profile by attacking lenders like  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C).
Banks worry that even if the Massachusetts senator does not become the next U.S. president, she would wield major influence on financial policy in any Democratic administration.
""While a hostile White House could pose challenges, the banking industry is working to mitigate those challenges by using its considerable clout in Congress,"" said Cam Fine, chief executive of advocacy consultancy Calvert Advisors and a longtime bank lobbyist.
On the campaign trail, Warren has proposed measures damaging for Wall Street, including breaking up big banks, taxing financial transactions, and reviving capital and liquidity rules weakened by the Trump administration.
She has also rejected corporate money, closing off a traditional avenue for influencing presidential candidates.
Lobbyists believe they can rely on Congressional Republicans to oppose Warren's agenda, but they need to sway moderate Democrats to block any drastic legislation, especially in the Senate where most bills require 60% of the vote to pass.
Thirty-five Senate seats are up for re-election in 2020 and the winning party is expected to wield only a slim majority.
Banks are targeting Democrats on the U.S. Senate banking committee who need war chests for re-election bids, including Virginia's Mark Warner and Alabama's Doug Jones, as well as other senators with bipartisan track records such as Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema and Michigan's Gary Peters, lobbyists said.
Some Democrats, including Peters, have received more cash from banks this cycle than leading Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.
""Elizabeth has a proven record of getting things done, even in the face of intense lobbying from corporate interests,"" said a spokeswoman for Warren.
Warner declined to comment. Jones and Sinema did not respond to requests for comment.
A spokeswoman for Peters said he had helped lead efforts to hold Wall Street accountable and protect consumers, and would ""continue to focus on doing what's best for Michigan families, Main Street community banks and credit unions.""Of the $5.8 million that banks and their lobby groups have given to lawmakers' campaigns so far this election cycle, 33% has gone to Democrats, the highest portion since 2010, the data shows.
""You can't get lasting legislation done in this city without it being bipartisan,"" said Tom Quaadman, an executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which this year said it would better reward lawmakers who focus on bipartisanship.
""That's why we are making sure we have strong ties with both parties.""
The American Bankers Association, the biggest bank group donor which has dished out $1.5 million so far this cycle, also plans to fund campaign ads in support of moderate Republicans and Democrats in tight races, the sources said.
An ABA spokesman declined to comment.
ECONOMIC ROLE
Media savvy and a consumer finance expert, Warren has proved adept at wrongfooting big banks, shining a spotlight on their missteps and slamming regulators she says are too industry-friendly. Beyond blocking legislation, banks need advocates who will rebut Warren's rhetoric, shield regulators from White House pressure to crackdown on them, and moderate the tone in Washington, the sources said.
Lobbyists are also courting lawmakers on the U.S. House of Representatives' finance panel, such as Ohio's Joyce Beatty, and those from districts with a significant financial footprint, including New York's Gregory Meeks, Georgia's David Scott and Connecticut's Jim Himes.
The Financial Services Forum representing the eight largest U.S. banks has decided to give directly to lawmakers for the first time. In meetings, it has used data on bank lending and employment to emphasize the large role banks play in lawmakers' constituencies and the broader economy, its CEO Kevin Fromer said in an interview.
The message is resonating with some lawmakers.
""To say ... banks are the evil people of the world would go against the interests of the communities I represent,"" Meeks told Reuters.
He said he wants banks to operate fairly, but that Warren's proposals to curtail the industry could reduce banking services in minority communities like those he represents in New York's Queens borough. ""We talk because I'd like banks to also invest in communities like mine,"" he added.
Beatty, Scott and Himes did not respond to requests for comment.
Warren has argued that lax bank regulation can harm minorities, while vigorously defending rules that guard against discriminatory and predatory lending.
""This campaign is about building a grassroots movement of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to hold Wall Street accountable and to produce an economy that works for everyone,"" said Warren's spokeswoman.
Wall Street has struggled since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis to rehabilitate its image in Washington and rebuild the Democratic support it once enjoyed. Some lobbyists are skeptical they will gain much ground. Many, though, said they have been encouraged by signs of a thaw after the industry in 2018 persuaded a group of moderate Democrats to back a rewrite of post-crisis rules, despite intense criticism from Warren.
""The industry is much more attuned to the political cycle this go-around,"" said one consultant."
1565,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 07:01AM ET</span>",Ousted Renault CEO Bollore raised concerns of governance problems at Nissan: report,"PARIS (Reuters) - Renault's former chief executive Thierry Bollore, who was ousted in October, had sought to flag alleged conflicts of interest and governance problems at the company's Japanese alliance partner Nissan before his departure, Le Monde reported on Monday.
Citing a letter from Oct. 7 addressed to Nissan's (T:7201) board, of which he was member, France's Le Monde newspaper said Bollore had raised questions over the firm's internal investigation surrounding former alliance boss Carlos Ghosn.
Nissan and  Renault  were left reeling by Ghosn's arrest in Tokyo a year ago, on financial misconduct charges which he denies. They have since tried to reboot their strained partnership by revamping their management teams, including by purging them of Ghosn allies and removing people in top jobs at the time of the scandal.
Bollore - who took a step up at the French carmaker when Ghosn left even though he was known for his close ties to the alliance founder - was eventually pushed out as Renault's CEO on Oct. 11, days after penning his letter.
In comments sent to Reuters, Nissan spokeswoman Azusa Momose denied there were any irregularities in its internal investigation of Ghosn's affairs, and added that the company had reviewed its processes once again following Bollore's letter.
""Nissan's independent directors confirmed that the investigation was properly conducted and could be relied on,"" Momose said.
Nissan directors had discussed all the allegations raised by Bollore and the company ""concluded that Bollore's concerns were not founded and were based for the most part on inaccurate information and speculation,"" she added.
Bollore said in the letter that he was particularly concerned by the revelation that Nissan had a list of 80 managers implicated in financial dealings similar to the ones attributed to Ghosn.
He also raised issues with the chain of command at Nissan, saying some key board members were sometimes kept in the dark on internal matters.
Renault (PA:RENA), which is still searching for a permanent replacement for Bollore as CEO, had no immediate comment.
As well as changing its CEO, Nissan recently demoted senior vice president Hari Nada - a key whistleblower against Ghosn and whose role was also questioned in Bollore's letter - although its internal investigation had found no evidence against the executive."

As Brexit and trade war risks recede, and with the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank still adding liquidity, the outlook for the beginning of 2020 is bullish, strategists including Michael Hartnett wrote in a Dec. 12 note to clients.
“We continue to expect returns to be front-loaded in 2020,” the strategists said. Positioning is turning bullish and December’s global fund manager survey on Tuesday should confirm the positive sentiment, they added.
The strategists expect the S&P 500 to reach 3,333 by March 3 -- a rise of 5.2% from Friday’s close -- and see the 10-year Treasury yield hitting 2.2% by Feb. 2, an increase of 36 basis points.
Global stocks climbed to record highs Friday after the U.S. and China agreed to a phase-one trade deal and the U.K. Conservative party won a parliamentary majority, clearing the path for the country’s exit from the European Union. While equities in Asia were mixed on Monday, they climbed in Europe alongside futures on U.S. stock indexes, as investors awaited further detail on the trade front.

“Some of these geopolitical risks seem like they are somewhat resolved, but they’re only on hiatus,” Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors in London, said in an interview Friday.
While a rally should ensue in the short term, she said investors should take a defensive stance in their asset allocation.
The benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific fell 0.1%, receiving support from better-than-expected activity data from China. Later in the session, the STOXX Europe 600 index rose as much as 1.1% to reach an intraday record high ahead of an unexpected decline in German manufacturing data.
Many investors are “agnostic” about the next move for the market, Daniel Tenengauzer, head of markets strategy at BNY Mellon, wrote in a research note, citing client feedback.

1568,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 06:41AM ET</span>",Italy says rescue of Popolare di Bari complies with EU state aid rules,"MILAN (Reuters) - European Union competition authorities will have no reason to object to Italy's rescue of ailing cooperative lender Popolare di Bari, the country's regional affairs minister said on Monday.
The Rome government late on Sunday passed an emergency decree setting aside up to 900 million euros ($992 million) to recapitalize ailing Popolare di Bari.
Minister Francesco Boccia told Radio 24 the scheme had been devised in a way that would ensure compliance with EU state aid rules.
""The measures chosen by (Economy Minister Roberto) Gualtieri allow us to meet all EU rules,"" he said, when asked whether Brussels could take aim at the scheme after allowing Germany to rescue lender NordLB earlier this month.
""That's why only part of the funds will actually go to Popolare di Bari while the rest must come from the FITD (depositor protection) fund.""
EU competition authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the plan on Monday.
The bloc tightened banking rescue rules after the global financial crisis to avoid a repeat of bailouts that depleted public coffers. Under the new rules, taxpayers' money can be used only after investors in a bank have borne losses.
Broker Equita estimated Italy has spent 21 billion euros since 2015 to help its banks. Despite the new rules, Rome has managed to partly limit losses for ordinary Italians who had invested in their local banks.
The latest government plan envisages an injection of up to 900 million euros into state-owned Banca del Mezzogiorno-Mediocredito Centrale so that it can buy into a cash call at Popolare di Bari.
Of that amount, 500 million would be used to quickly bolster Popolare di Bari's balance sheet and the rest set aside in case of future requirements, a source close to the matter said on Sunday.
Italian banks will be asked to shoulder the rest of the bailout through the FITD fund, which only months ago financed the bulk of a 900 million euro rescue package for Genoa-based Carige (MI:CRGI).
The steering committee of the FITD fund is due to meet on Wednesday to discuss Popolare di Bari's rescue.
The biggest bank in Italy's underdeveloped south, Popolare di Bari has been laid low by problem loans which have swelled to a quarter of its total lending.
The bank urgently needs up to 1 billion euros in new capital, its chief executive said in a newspaper interview last week, after its capital reserves slipped below regulatory thresholds.
Like other regional banks, Popolare di Bari has failed to recover from Italy's worst post-war recession which, coming on the heels of a strong credit expansion, bankrupted thousands of businesses, saddling banks with unpaid loans."

(Reuters) - Cineworld (L:CINE) will buy Canada's Cineplex (TO:CGX) for $1.65 billion in cash, making the British firm the biggest cinema operator in North America as it looks to tackle increasing competition from online streaming services.
Cineworld said on Monday the deal, which values Cineplex at $2.1 billion including debt, would involve it seeking $2.3 billion in loans, sending shares of the FTSE-250 (FTMC) member down as much as 9% and erasing early gains.
The C$34 ($25.56) per share offer is at a premium of 42% to the Toronto-based company's closing price on Friday.
While cinemas rely on big movie releases to generate gains, streaming services like Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon's (O:AMZN) Prime Video are invading that space with direct to stream movies or releasing movies within a few weeks of their cinema debut.
""It (Cineworld) is effectively betting that Hollywood studios will consistently release films we all want to see, and that a recession won't hurt demand for a trip to the flicks,"" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.
""If this doesn't turn out to be the case then Cineworld could start to sink under the weight of its debt.""
Cineworld's adjusted net debt stood at $3.3 billion as at June 30, which was 3.3 times adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
It said it would focus on capital allocation to bring down its net debt to EBITDA ratio to around three times by end of fiscal 2021. The ratio is a key measure which can tell investors how long a company would take to repay its debt.
CANADIAN BOX OFFICE
Earlier this month, Cineworld hinted at slightly lower annual performance and the deal comes nearly two years after its $3.6 billion acquisition of Regal cinemas, which made it the world's second largest theater operator by number of screens.
The Cineplex deal would add 165 cinemas and 1,695 screens to Cineworld's network of 9,498 screens across 786 sites.
Currently, U.S.-based AMC Entertainment Holdings (N:AMC) is the world's largest cinema operator. It has about 11,000 screens in 1,000 theaters, according to its website.
""We see the cinema industry as broadly stable and are therefore positive about today's earnings-enhancing acquisition ... although the debt level does make us grip the edge of our seat,"" Peel Hunt analysts said in a note.
The deal also allows Cineworld to tap into the Canadian box office which grossed about $770 million last year. Cineplex has a 75% share of this market.
""Our immediate post-acquisition objectives will be to combine Cineplex with our U.S. business,"" Cineworld Chairman Anthony Bloom said.
CEO Moshe Greidinger said on a call with analysts that he does not expect the deal to face any antitrust issues since Cineworld has no existing businesses in Canada.
Cineworld's largest shareholder Global City Theatres B.V. - with a stake of about 28% - has agreed to back the deal."

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Shares in Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) plunged 12% on Monday after the appliance maker warned of a bigger than expected hit to fourth-quarter earnings at its North American business, and slashed its savings forecast for 2020 from its investment program. 
The Swedish company, in a statement released on Sunday, forecast a $70 million earnings hit in the quarter, partly due to a slower than expected startup of its new automated refrigerator and freezer plant in Anderson, South Carolina, which has hit deliveries and entailed extra costs. 
""The transition to the new facility has resulted in temporary capacity constraints impacting deliveries to some customers in the fourth quarter,"" Electrolux said.
The new plant will replace manufacturing at St Cloud, Minnesota and at another facility in Anderson.
Electrolux shares were down 12% by 0942 GMT on Monday, after rising 34% since the start of 2019 partly boosted by the expected benefits of the shift to the new factory.
""This is a setback for Electrolux, which was previously confident that this material factory transition would be more successful than prior big moves that had resulted in significant issues over the past 20 years,"" JP Morgan said in a research note.
Electrolux, which is investing about $250 million in the new Anderson plant, said it will now run its two Anderson facilities in parallel into the second half of next year to meet market demand and ensure a continued high product quality.
""This is a temporary setback and I am confident that the measures we are taking to strengthen our competitiveness in North America are the right ones,"" Chief Executive Jonas Samuelson told a conference call.
The company said its investment program and streamlining measures were still on track to generate about 3.5 billion crowns ($364 million) of annual cost savings, with full effect from 2024. But it slashed the forecast for 2020 to 200 million crowns from 800 million crowns.
Electrolux, which previously forecast a negative impact of $25 million on fourth quarter earnings from the move to the new factory, said it expected the capacity constraints in Anderson to be gradually resolved in the first half of 2020.

It said the $70 million impact now foreseen also included effects from accounting adjustments from previous quarters and a reduction in inventory by a large U.S. customer.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Stores in China said on Monday they were still selling Arsenal kit even after Mesut Ozil's Uighur comments, in a sign the soccer club may not be as heavily punished commercially as the National Basketball Association was over a pro-Hong Kong tweet.
A chatroom on Ozil on online forum Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) Tieba was shut on Monday, and the state-backed Global Times tabloid said that Ozil's online fan club had been ""suspended"" without providing further details. Some Chinese sellers on Alibaba's Taobao e-commerce platform said they had stopped selling his shirts.
But even as the fallout from his comments blasting China's policy toward its Muslim Uighur minority continued - drawing criticism from China's Foreign Ministry, state media and some fans - merchandise from the London club was still on sale.
State broadcaster CCTV on Sunday had removed Arsenal's Premier League game against Manchester City from its broadcast schedule. Chinese video streaming website PPTV did the same.
Arsenal was quick to distance itself from their midfielder's comments, posting a statement on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform saying it was his personal opinion.
But they prompted speculation the club would face a fate similar to the NBA, which says it has incurred substantial financial losses in China after a Houston Rockets official tweeted his support for the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests.
Following the tweet by the Rockets' general manager, Chinese broadcasters stopped showing NBA games, while corporate partners in the country scrapped or suspended relations with the league. Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise were also pulled from several  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) stores.
But checks by Reuters at stores selling merchandise by Arsenal's official kit supplier Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) in Beijing and Shanghai showed products related to the Premier League team were still on sale on Monday.
""We didn't receive any message that Arsenal's co-branded products should be removed from the shelves. These co-branded products were a collaboration with the whole Arsenal team, not with the player Ozil,"" said a staff at one of Adidas' Shanghai stores who would only give his name as Ben.
Adidas did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Arsenal-branded merchandise was also still on sale on major Chinese e-commerce platforms  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com on Monday. These platforms took Houston Rockets merchandise off their sales platforms in October after the comments.
""FAKE NEWS""
While some young Chinese, such as student Xiong Zexin, 23, said: It is always like this. They must pay a price for this,"" much of the furor has centered on Ozil not the club.
""If you don't understand this matter then there's no need for you to make comments about politics. You're not a politician,"" student Li Yandong, 29, said.
At least five sellers on Alibaba's domestically focused e-commerce platform Taobao told Reuters that they were no longer selling jerseys emblazoned with Ozil's name and his number ""10"" due to the incident.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions in Xinjiang as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign. China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs.
Ozil, a Turkish Muslim, called Uighurs ""warriors who resist persecution"" and criticized both China's crackdown and the silence of Muslims in response.
China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday that Ozil had been ""completely deceived by fake news and false statements"" and said he was welcome to visit Xinjiang.
""We also welcome Mr. Ozil to come to Xinjiang if he has the chance, to take a walk and look around, as long as he has a conscience, is able to distinguish right from wrong and uphold the principles of objectivity and fairness, he will see a different Xinjiang,"" its statement said.
An executive at another Chinese broadcaster, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation, said CCTV and PPTV's reactions were to be expected given the precedence set by the NBA, but said the timing and fact that Arsenal was British, and not American, could give it some leeway.
""The Arsenal incident is quite different from the NBA incident, because that happened just after (China's) National Day, when patriotic feelings were high,"" he said.
Still the Global Times, which is vocal in its criticism of companies whose behavior displeases Beijing, warned that Arsenal could still face further blowback. The newspaper's stance does not necessarily reflect Chinese government policy.
""The episode has destroyed Ozil's image and Arsenal and the Premier League may have to pay the price,"" the Global Times said on its official Twitter account.

Investing.com -- Europe’s benchmark stock index hit a new all-time high Monday as investors poured money into U.K. stocks and the continent continued to enjoy support from news of the U.S.-China trade truce on Friday.
By 5:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was at 416.46, just off the new record high of 416.60 that it posted earlier in the morning. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 2.0% as international investors took advantage of a dip in sterling, which paused for breath after a steep rally in the wake of last week’s general election. Mining stocks in particular were supported by data overnight suggesting that the Chinese economy is bottoming out.
The DAX lagged a little, rising only 0.6%. That was due in part to reports that China had threatened Germany with “consequences” if Berlin moves to exclude Huawei from building sensitive 5G telecoms networks.
The gains across the continent were somewhat at odds with ‘flash’ purchasing manager indexes which showed no real sign of improvement in manufacturing activity after a year in which they have tumbled to the lowest levels in a decade.
IHS Markit’s manufacturing PMI for the euro zone fell to 45.9 from 46.9 in November, with both the French and German indexes falling short of expectations. The composite eurozone PMI stayed just in positive territory at 50.6, thanks to slightly better-than-expected contributions from services.
However, that rounded off the weakest quarter for the Eurozone economy since it emerged from recession in 2013.
“Germany’s steep manufacturing downturn has added to the chance of its economy contracting slightly in the fourth quarter, but France is enjoying a more resilient performance, providing a key area of support to help keep the eurozone growing,” IHSMarkit’s Chris Williamson said in a statement.
Although new export orders in the region’s largest economy ticked up slightly, “the ‘green shoots’ narrative remains more a forecast than rooted in actual data,” said Dario Perkins, head of global macro strategy at TS Lombard in London.
Business activity in the U.K. declined in both manufacturing and services in December, according to its flash PMIs. However, those surveys have already been superseded by the election, which has changed investor sentiment toward the world’s most unloved asset class – U.K. equities – almost overnight.
Despite the generally positive tone, the most conspicuous individual movements were down: Swedish appliance maker Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) fell 12% after saying that it would incur higher-than-expected costs from moving to new facilities in the U.S. and that cost savings would not be as high next year as it had first forecast. Meanwhile U.K.-based Cineworld (LON:CINE) fell 7.8% after saying it will buy Canada’s biggest operator of movie theaters, Cineplex, for $2.1 billion, in a debt-financed deal that will leave it highly leveraged. On the more positive side, slower-than-expected quarterly sales growth failed to stop fast fashion giant H&M (ST:HMb) rising over 2% to a new one-month high."

Woolworths said in a statement that 99.5% of its shareholders had voted in favor of the first stage of the restructuring, which paves the way for the combination of the Endeavour Drinks and ALH Group businesses.
The company said the combined entity would eventually be separated through a demerger or other ""value added alternative"". It expects the merger of the two businesses to take place on February 2, 2020.
Woolworths, which is currently embroiled in a lawsuit for underpaying thousands of supermarket workers, revealed its divestment plans in July with an aim to focus more on its core business.
The company said that if a separation of Endeavour Group takes place through a demerger, it intends to maintain a 15% shareholding in the new firm."

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya Airways (NR:KQNA) named the head of its low-cost subsidiary as its new acting chief executive officer on Monday after its current boss announced his resignation in May amid the loss-making carrier's renationalization process.
The new acting CEO Allan Kilavuka has been CEO of Kenya Airways subsidiary Jambojet for about a year. He will continue in that role as well as leading Kenya Airways ""until a substantive CEO for Kenya Airways has been recruited and appointed"", the carrier said.
Kenyan lawmakers in July voted to have the state take back the airline, which is 48.9% government-owned and 7.8% held by Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF). Kenya Airways was privatized more than 20 years ago but sank into debt and losses in 2014 after a failed expansion drive, among other factors.
The departing boss, Sebastian Mikosz, said in May that he would leave by the end of the year for personal reasons after leading the airline since June 2017.
""The nationalization process is still ongoing and the airline can't be left with a leadership vacuum,"" said Lisa Kimathi, an investment analyst at Standard Investment Bank. ""Kilavuka is definitely experienced on the operations of (Kenya Airways).""
Kilavuka has led the five-year-old low-cost carrier Jambojet since January 2019. Prior to that, he was General Electric's global operations leader for sub-Saharan Africa, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
Mikosz wished his successor the best. ""He knows he can count on me anytime,"" he told Reuters in a text message.
Mikosz said in November he expected the nationalization process to be completed by next year. Kenya Airways is hoping to emulate the successful model employed by its rival, state-owned Ethiopian Airlines, sub-Saharan Africa's biggest airline.
In August, Kenya Airways reported a first-half pretax loss of 8.56 billion Kenyan shillings ($83 million), more than double a year earlier.
The airline flies to 54 destinations around the world, the majority of which are in Africa."

Retailer   Sports Direct   (LON:SPD) reported a 6.1% decline in organic, currency-adjusted group revenues in the six months through October.
Overall revenue increased by 14% to 2.04 billion pounds thanks to past acquisitions including Game Digital, which contributed 133.9 million pounds.
Underlying EBITDA was up 22% to £181.2m.
The group cited its new elevation strategy – an investment program to pep up the appearance of its stores - as the reason for the overall drop. 
Mike Ashley’s empire, which bought department store House of Fraser in 2018, said profit before tax increased by 160% to £193.4m due to improved underlying operating performance and an £84.9m gain arising from the sale of one of its distribution centers.

Train and bus operator FirstGroup (LON:FGP) has given in to pressure from shareholders Robert Tchenguiz and Coast Capital, and appointed advisors to review its North American contract businesses First Student and First Transit, with a view to a possible sale.
The news comes around a month after FirstGroup’s share price tumbled after it wrote down the valuation of its Greyhound bus operations in the U.S., which it has been trying to sell since May.
The decision “reflects the resolute focus of the entire Board on realising value for all shareholders,” CEO Matthew Gregory said.

Cinema operator Cineworld (LON:CINE) proposed to buy Cineplex, Canada’s largest operator of movie theaters, for 2.8 billion Canadian dollars in cash (US$2.21 billion). Global City Theatres BV, Cineplex’s largest shareholder, has already agreed to the deal.
The deal will be financed by debt. Cineworld said it expects $130 million of annual synergies, and a boost of over 10% to earnings per share in the first year following completion. It will aim for a net debt/EBITA ratio of 3x by the end of its fiscal 2021 year.
Cineplex runs 165 cinemas and 1,695 screens and has a 75% market shares in Canada. The portfolio would significantly strengthen Cineworld’s position, given its ownership of the Regal chain of theaters in the U.S., which it is currently revamping.
“The combination of Cineplex and Regal will create the leading North American cinema operator with unrivalled scale and opportunity,” said CEO Mooky Greidinger.

NMC Health (LON:NMC) said it intends to buy back up to $90 million of its convertible bonds due 2025, noting that their current price of 89.5c represents an attractive opportunity to manage its liabilities.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) plans to have more experienced pilots on board the world's longest non-stop flights than on its current long-haul flights for the first 18 months as it evaluates fatigue, said sources with knowledge of the matter.
The airline said last week it could buy up to 12 Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350 planes for the commercial flights of up to 21 hours that includes the Sydney-London route, but the deal depends on pilots voting to approve a pay agreement in March.
""To be clear, we have not yet placed an order for this aircraft because we still have a gap to close in the business case,"" Qantas Chief Pilot Dick Tobiano said in an internal memo to pilots seen by Reuters. 
Qantas said Australia's aviation regulator had provisionally advised it saw no regulatory obstacles to the flights, which could extend pilot duty times to as long as 23 hours to account for potential delays.
The airline has conducted crew fatigue studies on London-Sydney and New York-Sydney test flights.
On its current long-haul flights, Qantas has a crew of one captain, one first officer and two second officers, the latter of which can only fly at cruising altitudes and cannot perform takeoffs or landings.
Rival Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) uses two captains and two first officers on its near-19 hours flights from Singapore to New York. 
Qantas has offered to crew non-stop flights to London and New York with one captain, two first officers and one second officer for the first 18 months so it can evaluate fatigue-related issues, according to its pilot union newsletter, two pilots and a company source familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak with media. Qantas declined to comment. 
Qantas has proposed the pilots on its A330 fleet, which fly mostly cross-country and Asian flights, also fly the ultra-long haul missions on the A350, since they can be licensed on both models.
A Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman said it had yet to receive a formal application for the flights that would allow it to make specific requests on matters such as experience levels but the airline's overall ultra-long haul safety framework provided a ""satisfactory and detailed analysis of the identified risks"".
Adam Susz, a 737 captain and union negotiator for the Australian and International Pilots Association, said Qantas had tabled a draft proposal that had been deemed unacceptable by the union committee, in part because it introduced a lower pay scale for new second officers. But he said talks would resume in the new year.

""I am pretty confident that we will get agreement in the end,"" Susz told Reuters on Monday. ""I don't think the issues are insurmountable but there are a couple of elements to the Qantas proposal that we find extremely unpalatable and we will avoid those the best we can.""

1583,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 01:08AM ET</span>",PG&E Faces a Sprint to Fix Restructuring After Governor’s Rebuke,"(Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gavin Newsom has long called for PG&E Corp. to emerge from its bankruptcy radically transformed. Now, the beleaguered utility has to race to meet his demands -- or else see its restructuring plan blow up.
The state’s largest power company has until Tuesday to address conditions that Newsom laid out in a letter late last week rejecting its reorganization proposal. The governor said the current plan falls “woefully short” of meeting requirements of a key state law and insisted on changes that could reshape PG&E, including an entirely new board and the option for a takeover.
Newsom’s rebuke upends PG&E’s restructuring just as the path toward a smooth exit next year seemed to be clearing. The San Francisco-based company, in bankruptcy after its equipment caused massive wildfires, earlier this month reached a $13.5 billion settlement with victims of the blazes. The deal, however, is dependent on the governor’s support and his determination that the reorganization complies with a state law that would provide financial assistance for future fire costs.
“His list of demands might be hard for the company to accept, putting the whole Chapter 11 timeline in jeopardy,” said Jared Ellias, a bankruptcy law professor at the University of California, Hastings. “He could have asked for something akin to changing the drapes. Instead it’s more like he is asking them to change their floor plan.”
In his letter to PG&E Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson, Newsom said the bankruptcy resolution “must yield a radically restructured and transformed utility that is responsible and accountable.” He called for a better financial plan, clearly defined safety metrics and a “streamlined process” for a state or third-party takeover if warranted. He also said he doesn’t expect that the post-confirmation board will include any current directors.
PG&E said its plan meets state law and “is the best course forward for all stakeholders.”
“We’ve welcomed feedback from all stakeholders throughout these proceedings and will continue to work diligently in the coming days to resolve any issues that may arise,” the company said in a statement Friday.
Under the settlement agreement, the company has to modify the plan in a manner “acceptable to the governor” by Tuesday.
Political Pressure
Newsom, who took office just weeks before PG&E filed the largest-ever utility bankruptcy in January, faces political pressure to show dramatic changes. The company’s role in deadly wildfires has provoked widespread public outrage, which was exacerbated in October after a series of mass blackouts designed to keep its power lines from sparking wildfires during dry, windy conditions. The governor threatened a state takeover of the company after the outages if it couldn’t improve its operations.
“After the company exits bankruptcy, Newsom really needs it to succeed,” Ellias said. “It could put his entire career as governor in jeopardy if this company isn’t successful.”
A recent poll by the University of California at Berkeley showed that a majority of the state’s voters are in favor of changing the way PG&E operates, with one-third wanting an end to it as an investor-owned utility.
Already, a California lawmaker is planning to introduce legislation that would turn PG&E into a government-owned utility. And a group of mayors and local officials have floated a proposal to make it a customer-owned cooperative.
Rival Bid
Newsom’s demands could give activist investor Elliott Management Corp. and Pacific Investment Management Co. another shot at rallying support around a rival restructuring plan. They’re leading a group of bondholders that have offered to inject $20 billion in cash into PG&E in exchange for most of the equity in the company.
In a statement Thursday, Elliott blasted PG&E’s own restructuring proposal, saying it would saddle the company with an additional $10 billion in debt, limit its safety investments and turn the utility into a “junk-bond issuer.”
In his letter, Newsom raised similar concerns that PG&E’s debt-heavy plan wouldn’t allow for the company to make billions of dollars of needed safety investments.
“All of this contributes to a reorganized company, that, in my judgment, will not be positioned to provide safe, reliable, affordable electric service,” he said."

Major brokerage firms, in their 2020 outlooks, have been blaming factors from macro issues to sector-specific concerns.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has said a better batch of financial and property firms can be found in rival Singapore. To UBS Group AG, Hong Kong stocks are still not cheap versus the city-state.
This year started strongly for Hong Kong stocks after double-digit declines in 2018. But then trade concerns were inflamed and the city was rattled by protests, plunging the economy into recession.
There were some sign of optimism late last week, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index jumping 4.7% to notch its best three-day run since June amid fresh signs a trade deal was near. The first phase of a broader agreement was announced later Friday. Still, the Hang Seng Index’s 7% gain for 2019 trails double-digit advances for many stock indexes around the world, including China’s. The gauge was 0.2% lower on Monday, compared with a 0.1% dip in the Shanghai Composite Index.

Morgan Stanley ranked MSCI Hong Kong, up 6.3% this year, last among 30 markets “despite an improving relative price-to-book valuation. Our macro and analyst team sees a longer-term period of adjustment for key domestic sectors -- especially for the banks.”
Meanwhile, strategists including Jonathan Garner last month turned overweight on financials in Singapore, like Hong Kong a major Asian financial hub.
That as Hong Kong’s economy is projected to shrink this year and barely grow in 2020, according to Morgan Stanley. Commercial-property rents and residential prices are projected to fall further.
Nonetheless, Morgan Stanley in November raised its targets for Chinese and Hong Kong stock indexes, the firm’s first across-the-board boosts for the region since February. Then, it reacted to both markets’ start-of-year pop. This round is “more driven by our more-optimistic views toward earnings growth in 2020 and 2021.” Morgan Stanley predicted this quarter may see China’s lowest economic-growth rate before improving.
Versus current levels, the new base-case scenarios called for single-digit gains the coming 12 months for both Chinese and Hong Kong stock indexes. The firm also ended its prior preference for A-shares, in part on a “richer valuation relative to the offshore market.”
Hong Kong stocks are among the least-favored equity markets in Asia Pacific next year for UBS strategists including Niall MacLeod, with their underweight rating offsetting an overweight call on China’s market. Beyond trade risks, they said last month in a research note that Hong Kong financial companies face margin pressure from 2019’s cuts in U.S. interest rates. The city’s dollar is pegged to the greenback, which results in Hong Kong monetary policy generally matching America’s.
Though Hong Kong stock valuations “are now more attractive” after this year’s underperformance, the strategists added the market is “still not cheap relative to Singapore on a sector-adjusted basis” and with Hong Kong’s uncertainty persisting. Other risks cited for equities there included exposure to China’s still-slowing economy and “local politics.”
In a separate report, UBS analysts including Wendy Liu wrote that Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong “may outperform” those in the mainland in 2020, possibly resulting in what’s now a 26% valuation gap between A-shares and H-shares to narrow.
Daiwa
The firm has been underweight stocks in both Hong Kong and China, in part on the latter’s slowing economy. Despite lagging in 2019, the city’s equities continue to trade at a “significant premium to Singapore,” Daiwa Capital Markets strategist Paul Kitney recently wrote. Hong Kong’s price-to-earnings ratio is about 20% higher.
“Spillover effects from the ongoing trade war and radically worsening domestic political risk require additional risk premium in Hong Kong and are negatively affecting inbound tourism and retail,” he added.
Goldman Sachs
Without specific reference to the impact of local politics,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is neutral about Hong Kong’s stock-market performance next year. “The market has arguably priced the current environment. However, lack of visibility regarding the timing and path of a return to more normal conditions suggests a market weight stance,” strategists including Timothy Moe wrote in a research note.
Unlike Morgan Stanley, a slight further contraction in Hong Kong’s economy is expected next year at Goldman.
But Goldman said the earnings impact on companies in the MSCI Hong Kong Index should be “less than might be expected” as property firms account for nearly one-third of earnings reported by benchmark members. Big insurer AIA Group Ltd. generates an additional 20% of the total profit and conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. contributes 11%. Protest-hit “retail and hotels only account for 1% of earnings, so the passthrough of the weak economy to index earnings is muted.”
Also, Goldman said Chinese companies listed in the city may get some help from mainland investors, whose 2020 net buying of Hong Kong-listed stocks could jump 40% from this year’s estimate to $35 billion as more firms may offer shares in the city.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. last month held Hong Kong’s largest stock sale in nearly a decade at more than $11 billion.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2019 10:52PM ET</span>",SoftBank’s China strategy wobbles as key bets disappoint,"By Kane Wu, Julie Zhu and Yingzhi Yang
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - For SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), financial technology firm OneConnect's IPO should have been a vindication of an aggressive China investing strategy.
Instead, embarrassed bankers had to slash the offering size and cut its price as investors baulked at a business model seen too reliant on majority owner Ping An Insurance (SS:601318). The IPO valued OneConnect at $3.7 billion, about half its worth last year when SoftBank's Vision Fund invested $100 million, and its stock finished flat in its debut on Friday.
OneConnect Financial Technology (N:OCFT) is just one of many China bets placed by the Japanese investment giant or its massive Vision fund which have run into trouble. That's added to global woes for SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, under fire for bad judgement and insufficient due diligence, exemplified by U.S. office-space startup WeWork's disastrous IPO attempt and subsequent bailout.
In  ZhongAn Online  P&C Insurance Co Ltd's (HK:6060) 2017 IPO, for example, SoftBank ploughed in $550 million as a cornerstone investor. But the deal was seen by some investors as way overvalued and now trades at about half its IPO price. 
Its unlisted portfolio has also had problems. The Vision Fund in February invested $1.5 billion in Guazi.com, valuing the second-hand car dealing platform at more than $9 billion.
But a $500 million funding round for Guazi.com in the first half of the year failed to get off the ground, people with knowledge of the fundraising said.
The people, who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified, said potential investors thought it was too pricey and were put off by its lack of profits in a sector where sales have been declining.
Guazi.com said in a statement that talks for new funds were advanced, investors included the Vision Fund and other top international investment institutions and that it expected to be profitable in the fourth quarter.
In fairness to SoftBank, many China IPOs have stumbled, hurt by a sharp slowdown in economic growth and trade tensions with the United States. 
But investors and some bankers looking at China-related deals say SoftBank's involvement, once a sign of promising prospects, was now viewed as a red flag that a company was likely overvalued.
""SoftBank has become a signal that the market has peaked,"" said one person involved in the OneConnect IPO.
SoftBank declined to comment on its investments in Chinese companies for this article. 
OTHER PROBLEMS
Other big bets like TikTok owner ByteDance and artificial intelligence firm Sensetime are threatened by the fallout from the U.S.-China trade conflict. The Vision Fund has invested roughly $1 billion in both, sources have said. 
ByteDance is entangled in a U.S. national security review over how it handles U.S. customer data. 
Sensetime in October was added to the U.S. ""entity list"" which bars it from buying U.S. components without U.S. government approval, over its alleged involvement in human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang.
Sensetime has countered it abides by all relevant laws of jurisdictions in which its operates and that it has been actively developing an AI code of ethics.
Ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing, one of SoftBank’s biggest China bets with $11.8 billion invested, appeared to have a bright future after U.S. rival Uber (N:UBER) traded its China business for a stake in Didi.
But the rape and a murder of a Didi passenger by her driver has dented the company's image, and its IPO timetable remains unclear after Uber valuations slid.
The Vision Fund opened a China office this year led by former Silver Lake managing director Eric Chen. Two sources familiar with the operation told Reuters that the pace of hiring for the China team has been slow, though SoftBank says the team has grown a lot since March to include about 20 investment professionals.
One source said Chen had scaled back the size of the deals he was looking at, now focusing on investments of around $50 million compared to those of $200 million-$300 million.
SoftBank declined to comment.
It's all a far cry from just two years ago, when SoftBank and the Vision Fund were ramping up. Son had made a killing with an early investment in  Alibaba  (N:BABA) - a stake now worth $140 billion - and the China tech business was booming.
Then, Son's penchant for splashy checks to help startups grow fast and quickly vanquish rivals was in full force - as evidenced by a meeting with Chinese online medical platform Ping An Good Doctor (HK:1833) in late 2017 to discuss pre-IPO fundraising.
""How much do you want to raise in the pre-IPO round and via IPO? "" Son asked Good Doctor's CEO Wang Tao, according to sources. 
Wang told him it would be $300 million and $1 billion respectively.
""How about I give you $1 billion and you drop the listing plans?"" Son said.
Wang later decided not to take him up on the $1 billion, receiving instead $400 million from the Vision Fund in a pre-IPO round before listing in Hong Kong last year.
In contrast to some of SoftBank's other China investments, its stock has made progress after a rocky start, however, climbing and mostly staying above its IPO price since October.

China’s Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1% by 11:35 PM ET (03:35 GMT), while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.6%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.3%.
The phase one deal was agreed on Friday and the two nations are expected to official sign the partial accord in the first week of January, Lighthizer said.
“There’s a translation period, There are some scrubs,” Lighthizer said in an interview with CBS News on Sunday. “This is totally done. Absolutely,” he added.
“The question was, how big -- how big was the first phase going to be. This is going to take years. We’re not going to resolve these differences very quickly.”
There is no scheduled date set for the second phase of talks, he noted. His comments contracted remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump, who said the phase two negotiations would start “immediately, rather than waiting until after the 2020 Election.”
On the data front, China’s industrial output rose 6.2% in November from a year earlier, versus a median estimate of 5.0%. Retail sales expanded 8.0% during the month, compared to a projected 7.6% increase. Fixed-asset investment was unchanged at 5.2% in the first eleven months, the same as forecast.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 0.1% lower. The Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged down to a seasonally adjusted 48.8 in December from a final 48.9 in the previous month.
The index stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for an eighth month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is considering whether to cut or halt production of its grounded 737 MAX after the Federal Aviation Administration said last week it would not approve the plane's return to service before 2020, a person briefed on the matter said on Sunday.
The largest U.S. planemaker's board of directors is holding a regular two-day meeting in Chicago starting Sunday and the company could make an announcement on production plans as soon as late Monday, the person said.
The Seattle Times reported Sunday the board is considering a proposal from top management to temporarily shut down 737 production. The person briefed on the matter told Reuters a temporary shutdown is more likely than another production cut, but it would potentially take a few weeks before production could be halted.
Boeing said in a statement Sunday the company ""will continue to assess production decisions based on the timing and conditions of return to service, which will be based on regulatory approvals and may vary by jurisdiction.""
Boeing has said if it did not receive approval to begin deliveries before the end of the year it could be forced to further slow production or temporarily shut down the MAX production line, a move that would have repercussions across its global supply chain.
The best-selling Boeing plane has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.
On Thursday, Boeing abandoned its goal of winning approval this month to unground the 737 MAX after Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg met with FAA Administrator Steve Dickson. Dickson said on Wednesday he would not clear the plane to fly before 2020 and disclosed the agency has an ongoing investigation into 737 production issues in Renton, Washington.
Dickson said Wednesday there are nearly a dozen milestones that must be completed before the MAX returns to service. Approval is not likely until at least February and could be delayed until March, U.S. officials told Reuters last week.
Dickson told Muilenburg, according to an email sent to lawmakers by the FAA, that ""Boeing’s focus should be on the quality and timeliness of data submittals for FAA review. He made clear that FAA’s certification requirements must be 100% complete before return to service.""
Boeing had said last month it expected the FAA would allow it to resume 737 MAX deliveries in December.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc said Thursday it was extending cancellations of 737 MAX flights through April 6.
The FAA told congressional staff in an email last week Dickson is ""concerned that Boeing continues to pursue a return-to-service schedule that is not realistic... More concerning, the administrator wants to directly address the perception that some of Boeing’s public statements have been designed to force FAA into taking quicker action.”"

The new capital comprises a 600 million euro term loan, a five-year 150 million pound ($192.45 million) credit facility and a 200 million pound package provided to a new THG subsidiary, the company said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

THG said it raised about 66 million pounds of primary equity from BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and Belgium-based investment company  Sofina  SA (BR:SOF) to help the company expand its beauty and wellness brands as well as its e-commerce platform Ingenuity.
The capital will also be used for developments of content studios and offices at Manchester Airport, the company added.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2019 06:26PM ET</span>","Exxon, Chevron face new round of shareholder climate resolutions","By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - An activist group is increasing the pressure on five big U.S. and European oil companies with shareholder resolutions urging them to meet the Paris climate goals and cut carbon emissions.
Dutch group Follow This is targeting U.S. giants ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and their European rivals Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  BP  (LON:BP) and Equinor with climate resolutions ahead of next year's annual general meetings (AGMs) scheduled for the first half of 2020.
Follow This owns minor stakes in the companies which enables it to file shareholder resolutions.
The Exxon and Chevron resolutions are vaguer than the European text, underscoring an Atlantic divide over companies' approach to climate change.
The U.S. version calls on the Exxon and Chevron boards to ""align its strategy with emission levels compatible with the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement"", which aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.
The European companies, which all agreed in recent years on various emission reduction targets, are however urged to set and publish clear long-term targets to meet the Paris goals.
The resolutions urge all companies to include all types of emissions in their climate strategies, including those from fuels and products sold to customers, known as Scope 3 emissions, which are 6 to 8 times bigger than emissions from the companies' operations.
Follow This first filed a climate resolution with Shell in 2016 but last year it expanded its efforts to other companies as the climate debate gathered momentum.
Its resolutions have always been opposed by the companies' boards and have never won a majority support, but they have often led to debates during annual meetings.
It is still unclear if the U.S. resolutions will be put to vote as companies are allowed to request regulators to bar shareholder resolutions.
Exxon last year successfully blocked a resolution by the Church Commissioners for England and the New York State comptroller's office.
Follow This also renewed pressure on Shell with a call to set out clear short, medium and long-term targets for greenhouse gas emission targets.
Last year the group did not file a resolution with the Anglo-Dutch company after it had agreed in 2017 together with a large group of investors on a long-term ambition to halve its emission intensity by 2050.
Shell confirmed a resolution has been filed and it is being reviewed. BP declined to comment. Equinor did not reply to requests for comment.
Chevron confirmed the resolution was filed. A spokesman for the company said it was ""too early to comment directly on stockholder proposals,"" adding that the company had established goals to reduce emission intensity in its upstream operations.
Exxon did not comment on the Follow This resolution but said that ""all shareholder proposals will go through the proper process in advance of the annual meeting.""

(Reuters) - International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (N:IFF) on Sunday said it will merge with DuPont Inc's (N:DD) $26.2 billion nutrition & biosciences unit in a deal that will create a new consumer giant valued at more than $45 billion.
Under terms of the agreement, DuPont shareholders will own 55.4% of the shares of the new company and existing IFF shareholders will own 44.6%, IFF said in a statement.
The deal has been unanimously approved by both boards, New York-based IFF said.
Industrial materials maker DuPont will also receive a one-time cash payment of $7.3 billion upon closing of the deal, IFF added.
IFF Chief Executive Officer Andreas Fibig will run the combined company and will also continue to be chairman of the board.
Ireland's Kerry Group was also negotiating with DuPont for its nutrition unit, Bloomberg had previously reported.
""We conducted a very thorough process leading us to the selection of IFF as the preferred strategic partner for N&B,"" DuPont Executive Chairman Ed Breen said.
IFF, which creates flavors and fragrances, works with global brands to develop scents and tastes for products that are household names.
""Together, we will create a leading ingredients and solutions provider with a broader set of capabilities to meet our customers' evolving needs,"" IFF's Fibig said.
The combination will be executed using a tax-efficient structure called a Reverse Morris Trust, IFF said. Such transactions let a company avoid a big tax bill by spinning off a unit that it wants to divest and simultaneously merging it with another company.
After the deal closes, IFF expects cost savings of about $300 million on a run-rate basis by the end of third year.
The companies said they have obtained fully-committed debt financing from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
IFF also said its largest shareholder, Winder Investments, has agreed to vote in favor of the deal.

Greenhill & Co and Morgan Stanley advised IFF while Credit Suisse Securities (USA) and Evercore served as DuPont's advisers.

LONDON (Reuters) - Tens of trillions of global investment dollars are pouring into companies touting robust environmental, social and governance credentials. Now short-sellers spy an opportunity. 
Such hedge funds, often cast as villains of the piece because they bet against share prices, scent a profit from company valuations they believe are unduly inflated by ESG promises or which they say ignore risks that threaten to undermine the company's prospects.
The fact short-sellers, who look to exploit information gaps, are targeting the ESG sphere underlines the complexities facing investors in accurately gauging companies' sustainability credentials. Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg last week spoke of CEOs masking inaction with ""creative PR"".
Against a backdrop of growing public and political concerns about climate change and economic inequality, companies are under increasing pressure to show they are taking greater responsibility for how they generate their profits. 
Investments defined as ""sustainable"" account for more than a quarter of all assets under management globally, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance. About $31 trillion has been invested, buoyed by analyst reports that show companies with strong ESG narratives outperform their peers. 
Some short-sellers, including Carson Block of Muddy Waters, Josh Strauss of Appleseed Capital and Chad Slater of Morphic Asset Management, argue share prices can be bolstered by corporate misrepresentation about sustainability, or so-called ""greenwashing"". 
""Greenwashing is absolutely rampant now,"" says Slater, whose fund bets on both rising and falling share prices. If companies fail to engage with long-term investors, he sees a red flag.
""From the short side, it's quite interesting.""
Analytics companies that provide corporate ESG ratings use a combination of company disclosures, news sources and qualitative analysis of third-party data. They are a major source of information for investors, but it is not an exact science.
Hedge funds have various strategies for selecting targets, often focusing on those they think show both ESG and more traditional financial or operational weakness. A high ESG rating can attract short interest.
A Reuters analysis of data from financial information company Refinitiv and national regulators in Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Italy shows the five companies in each country with the best ESG scores collectively were being shorted more than those with the worst scores. 
The short positions against the companies deemed to have the best ESG credentials were 50% greater in size than those placed against the worst-performers.

PATCHY DATA
ESG data providers compile ratings based on a slew of measures ranging from energy usage to board gender make-up, salary gap data and the scale of negative press reports on the company from newspapers across the world.
Refinitiv, part-owned by the parent company of Reuters News, factors in more than 400 ESG measures for each company, taken from a range of sources including company reports, regulatory filings, NGO websites and news articles.
A key problem, though, is scant regulations governing what ESG measures and risks companies must disclose and their patchy nature, said Diederik Timmer, executive vice president of client relations at Sustainalytics, a major ESG data provider.
    ""When things go well, companies report quite well on those, when things don't go so well it gets awfully quiet,"" he added.
Some policymakers, largely in Europe, are pushing for standardized disclosures to help investors better gauge the risks, something which will leave less wriggle room for companies and make scores even more reliable. 
    Two leading global asset managers interviewed by Reuters, who manage nearly $1 trillion in assets but declined to be identified, said they had tested their portfolios using several data providers and found the correlation between ESG ratings to be so low, they are building their own ranking system.
Peter Hafez, chief data scientist at RavenPack, which helps hedge funds analyze data to get a trading edge, agreed. 
""There's no perfect ESG rating out there,"" he said.
The influence of news flows on investor sentiment was underlined by a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) study https://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/RPS_EN-PROD/PROD0000000000500285/Climate_change_and_corporates%3A_Past_the_tipping_po.PDF published in September that mapped 1,600 stocks and millions of company announcements and climate-related media reports over two decades. 
It found companies that had a greater proportion of positive announcements and press over the preceding 12 months outperformed the MSCI World Index by 1.4% a year, on average, while those with more negative news underperformed by 0.3%.

BIG RISKS FOR SHORTS
Short-sellers borrow shares, pay the lender a fee and sell them on, betting the price will fall before buying them back and returning them to the original lender - pocketing the difference, minus the fee.
But it is not for the faint-hearted. If funds trigger a share price fall, they can earn millions, but the downside, should shares rise, is unlimited. 
The perils of the practice were shown by the shorts burnt by a 17% surge in the shares of Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in October after a surprise quarterly profit. Short-sellers suffered paper losses of $1.4 billion, erasing most of their 2019 profits, according to analytics firm S3 Partners. 
And in a decade-long stock market bull-run, short-selling can be tricky.
Morphic's joint chief investment officer Slater said the Sydney-based money manager's standalone short positions in its Trium Morphic ESG long-short fund had weighed on the portfolio over the past 12 months.
Niche activist short-sellers, who can torpedo company valuations by publishing negative reports on targets - often alleging fraud or serious failures - are often criticized for undermining long-term company objectives and blurring the lines between whistleblower and market manipulator.
Short-sellers agree they are biased, but argue no more than long investors, the banks that raise money for the company and the company's management.
Carson Block, founder of American short-seller Muddy Waters, who shot to prominence spotting wrongdoing in some Chinese-run companies, is now seeking a ""morality short"" on ESG - branching out from a traditional focus on corporate governance issues to targets whose success he says hinges on secretly harming society.
As an example of what he is seeking, he points to the U.S. opioid crisis, which has triggered around 2,500 lawsuits by authorities seeking to hold drugmakers responsible for stoking a scandal that has claimed almost 400,000 overdose deaths between 1999 and 2017.
""I'm really skeptical of ESG,"" he says, likening the use of the acronym by the corporate world to the token straw slipped into a large plastic cup with a plastic lid.

""ESG is the paper straw of investing,"" he says. ""I definitely want to find companies like that because I know they're out there and I want to help put them down.""

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2019 04:49AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's BAIC raising Daimler stake to unseat Geely as top shareholder - sources,"By Yilei Sun, Julie Zhu and Edward Taylor
BEIJING/HONG KONG/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler's (DE:DAIGn) main China joint venture partner BAIC Group has set in motion a plan to double its stake to around 10% and win a board seat in the German luxury car maker, as it aims to upstage rival Geely, two sources told Reuters.
State-owned Beijing Automobile Group Co Ltd (BAIC), which already owns a 5% shareholding in  Daimler , has started buying the German company's shares from the open market, said the sources who were briefed on the matter.
BAIC is currently Daimler's third largest shareholder but a stake of 10% will make it the biggest shareholder, surpassing its Chinese automaking rival Zhejiang Geely Holding Group which owns 9.69% of the German automaker and is seeking to expand its partnership with Daimler in China.
With the shareholding of around 10%, BAIC is looking to secure a seat at Daimler’s supervisory board, which Geely does not currently have, the sources said.
HSBC, which advised BAIC on its 5% stake purchase in Daimler earlier, is helping the Beijing-based group in the new investment, one of the sources said.
Daimler said in a regulatory filing last month that HSBC held 5.23% in Daimler's voting rights directly as well as through instruments such as equity swaps as of Nov. 15.
When asked by Reuters, Daimler said it had not received any notification about BAIC having raised its stake. Daimler's China chief Hubertus Troska said on Friday ""we welcome long-term investors in Daimler"". Asked about BAIC and its potential to become a larger shareholder, he added, ""we like each other. Let us see how things develop.""
A third source familiar with BAIC's thinking said that BAIC wanted to be a bigger shareholder than Geely in Daimler in order to be seen as the German automaker's senior-most partner in China.
BAIC and Geely did not respond to requests for comments made after usual business hours. HSBC declined to comment.
The sources declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to media.
DAIMLER'S CHINA PARTNERS
Reuters reported in November that BAIC had signaled intentions to extend its investment in Daimler, citing sources familiar with the matter.
BAIC has been Daimler's main partner in China for years and operates Mercedes-Benz factories in Beijing through the two automakers’ main joint venture, Beijing Benz Automotive.
Two months before its 5% stake purchase was announced in July, sources told Reuters that BAIC wanted to invest in Daimler to secure its investment in Beijing Benz Automotive.
The partners also planned to revamp manufacturing facilities to make Mercedes Benz-branded trucks via their commercial vehicle joint venture Foton Daimler Automotive (BFDA), Reuters reported in August citing a document and sources familiar with matter.
BAIC built its 5% Daimler stake after Li Shufu, chairman of Zhejiang-based private automaker Geely, built a 9.69% stake in Stuttgart-based Daimler in early 2018.
By using Hong Kong shell companies, derivatives, bank financing and structured share options, Li kept the plan under wraps until he was able, at a stroke, to become Daimler's single largest shareholder.
Since the investment, Geely and Daimler have said they plan to build the next generation of Smart electric cars in China through a joint venture.
Geely owns Volvo and a 49.9% stake in Malaysian car maker Proton, while BAIC, in addition to Daimler, has a partnership with South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380)."

 Japan Post Insurance Co Ltd  (T:7181), a unit of Japan Post Holdings (T:6178), said in September it discovered 6,327 cases of improper sales and that 1,400 cases among them are suspected of violating the law.
A special investigation committee spoke to around 120,000 clients in determining the number of mis-sold policies over the past five years, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter.
In some cases, terms and conditions were not properly explained to clients, while in others sales to the elderly were made without their families present, a violation of internal rules, the Yomiuri reported.
A Japan Post Insurance spokesman said the company was not the source of the report, and that the date to release the final report was not yet decided, declining further comment.
Another group company,  Japan Post Bank Co Ltd  (T:7182), also said in September it had improperly sold investment trust products to elderly customers in about 19,500 cases.
Once the internal investigation is concluded, Japan Post Insurance has said it will consider imposing punishments such as disqualifying insurance agents who violated law or internal rules."

A decision on the matter is due next week, the paper said, without specifying a reason for the possible ban.
Swatch reached a deal with Weka in 2013 to progressively cut the number of watch movements - the tiny mechanisms that make a watch tick without help of a battery - ETA sells each year so as to reduce its dominant market position.
Under the agreement, which runs to the end of 2019, ETA undertook not to serve any new customers.
After 2019 the assumption was that other suppliers would have filled gaps ETA left in the market, leaving the Swatch unit free to resume selling to whoever it chooses.
Weka commissioned a study to see if the market had opened up in the way it hoped, the paper said. It said the commission's secretariat had recommended banning ETA from delivering mechanisms to clients in 2020 and the body would decide on its actions next week.
The newspaper implied that the study was the reason for the ban but stopped short of saying so.
The newspaper quoted Swatch Chief Executive Nick Hayek as saying: ""It is unacceptable that this authority needs this much time to complete its study - or to reach a decision.""
""The Competition Commission is not in charge of organizing the market,"" Hayek was quoted saying.
Weka and Swatch were not immediately available for comment."

The report said De Meo would initially become CEO of Renault for two years before taking over responsibility for the group's alliance with Nissan (T:7201) and Mitsubishi (T:7211).
Reuters had reported previously that De Meo was a possible candidate for the top job, along with interim Chief Executive Clotilde Delbos and Patrick Koller, the Franco-German CEO of car parts maker  Faurecia  (PA:EPED), who was also tipped for the role.
If confirmed, De Meo's appointment would help end a prolonged period of turbulence for the French carmaker, which has been struggling to recover from the high-profile arrest of former leader Carlos Ghosn a year ago.
Renault and SEAT declined to comment on the newspaper report. 
Ghosn, who helped forge the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, was arrested in Japan last November on financial misconduct charges that he denies.
Financial chief Delbos took over the reins at Renault after former CEO Thierry Bollore was ousted in October in a purge of executives associated with the Ghosn-era, a move intended to help patch up the strained alliance with Nissan.

Italian-born De Meo has served as the chairman of SEAT's executive committee for four years, overseeing a resurgence in the Barcelona-based company's sales and boosting its prominence within the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) group.

The four funds approved at the beginning of December brings the total number of such funds to 23, the paper reported, adding that nearly 100 more were currently awaiting approval.

1604,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 14, 2019 05:42AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Three things that flew under the radar this week.

1. The Nasdaq 100 Welcomes New Stocks

Every year, Nasdaq analysts evaluate all the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index and cull some in favor of up-and-comers they believe better represent the dynamics of the economy.
Late Friday, Nasdaq said it was adding six new stocks and cutting six current members of the index.

Coming in before the market opens on Dec. 23 are:







Out will be:







The problem with the outgoing stocks is they are mostly in industries with low growth prospects (toys for Hasbro), low profit margins (like J.B. Hunt in the trucking industry) or exposed directly to geopolitical risks (Wynn in China).
Five of the newcomers are tech or tech-related companies. Seattle Genetics, up 101% this year, is a hot biotech.

The new stocks are up an average 73.8% year to date. The weakest performer of the six is Splunk, still up nearly 37% compared with 34% for the Nasdaq 100 overall. It may also be a takeover candidate.

The departing stocks are up an average 21% this year, but Mylan is down 30% for the year.
2. Retail Sales Slipping at the Worst Time
Economic data was lost in the shuffle for the second Friday in a row as the continuous – and at times somewhat contradictory -- statements from the U.S. and China on the phase 1 trade deal garnered all the attention.
This time it was a tepid retail sales report that lost the spotlight. But investors should take note as the latest numbers don’t bode well for a festive holiday shopping season.

Retail sales for November rose just 0.2%. That was well off the 0.5% rise that economists had predicted according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, ticked up 0.1%, shy of the 0.4% rise expected.
The consensus estimates may have been so strong due to bullish reports of record Black Friday sales, although Cyber Monday sales did land in December.
The numbers look especially anemic in comparison to the first eight months of the year, where retail sales averaged a monthly rise of 0.7%.
“Spending at traditional department stores alone was down 7% from a year ago, while spending at clothing and accessory stores was off 3% from a year ago,” Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk wrote. “That bodes well for those looking for more discounts this holiday season but suggests another round of retail bankruptcies in early 2020 as the broader retail market continues to adjust to consumers’ shifting preferences for online instead of in-store shopping.”
“The consumer should look a lot stronger in December, too late for many retailers to move the needle on margins, which are already razor-thin,” Swonk added.
Keith McCullugh of Hedgeye Risk Management tweeted that his Nowcast for fourth-quarter GDP ticked down to 0.36% after the retail sales numbers arrived.

The Atlanta Fed GDP Nowcast remained at 2% for 4Q, the same as last week.
3. Machine Over Man
The effect of computerized trading and algorithms has been very clear to anyone following the stock market lately amid the trade-war-induced swings.
The indexes and futures have been spiking and diving based on one headline or tweet and then just as quickly reversing course on new information before retail investors have a chance to react.
The Economist analyzed the rise of the machines in October, looking at $31 trillion in U.S. equities and it concluded that more are managed by computers and humans.

Statista broke this down with a very handy chart this week.
Looking at the chart, 35.1% of those U.S. equities are now managed by automatic, or computerized, funds. That’s followed by 25.3% managed by entities and governments and insurers, 24.5% managed by humans and 15.3% held by companies."
1605,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2019 02:34AM ET</span>",U.S. Justice Department preparing legal action against Live Nation: source,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is preparing to take legal action against Live Nation Entertainment (N:LYV) on allegations the concert promoter has sought to strong-arm concert venues into using its dominant Ticketmaster subsidiary, a source familiar with the planned legal action said on Friday.
The department believes the concert promoter's conduct has violated the merger settlement Live Nation and Ticketmaster reached with the government in 2010 and plans to file a decree enforcement action, the source said.
The Wall Street Journal was first to report the planned legal action on Friday.
Live Nation did not respond to a request for comment.
The Justice Department allowed the companies to merge on condition they abide by a range of conditions to keep ticket prices in check, including agreeing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ticketmaster-livenation-idUSTRE60O4E520100126 to be barred from retaliating against venue owners who use a competing ticket service.
As ticket prices rise and the settlement is set to expire next year, the government now plans to extend the restrictions by several years and prohibit coercive conduct by Live Nation.
With the merger, the company became an entertainment giant that does everything from managing musicians, operating venues, promoting concerts and selling tickets.
In a filing to the U.S. government, Live Nation said it had worked on 35,000 events with more than 4,500 artists in 2018. It also said that Live Nation owns, operates, has exclusive booking rights for or an equity interest in 237 venues, including the House of Blues.
Its management business worked with more than 400 artists, the filing said."
1606,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2019 01:06AM ET</span>",California governor rejects PG&E bankruptcy reorganization plan,"By Tom Hals and Steve Gorman
(Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday rejected a bankruptcy reorganization plan submitted by PG&E Corp (N:PCG), the state's largest investor-owned utility, saying its proposal fails to meet the requirements of a recently enacted wildfire law.
The decision by Newsom, sent to PG&E in a letter, complicates the company's push to exit bankruptcy and provide billions of dollars to victims of devastating wildfires in 2017 and 2018 sparked by the utility's power lines.
The embattled utility now has until Tuesday to further amend its plan to Newsom's satisfaction, but his criticism of the reorganization package as it was presented by PG&E a day earlier was sweeping.
Newsom said the plan lacks ""major changes in governance"" and tougher safety enforcement mechanisms mandated under the state wildfire statute, known as Assembly Bill 1054, which was enacted in July.
The governor also said PG&E's plan, including a proposed $13.5 billion settlement with victims of wildfires blamed on its power lines, would leave the company with a weakened capital structure and ""limited ability to withstand future financial and operational headwinds.""
""In my judgment, the amended plan and the restructuring transactions do not result in a reorganized company positioned to provide safe, reliable and affordable service to its customers, as required by AB 1054,"" Newsom wrote.
PG&E, in a statement after release of the governor's letter, disputed Newsom's findings that its reorganization plan fails to live up to the criteria of the wildfire law.
""We believe it does and is the best course forward for all stakeholders,"" the company said. ""We've welcomed feedback from all stakeholders throughout these proceedings and will continue to work diligently in the coming days to resolve any issues that may arise.""
State approval of reorganization plan is a necessary step before PG&E can submit the proposal for a vote by creditors and final approval from a bankruptcy judge in San Francisco.
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January citing projected civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from wind-driven blazes in 2017 and 2018 sparked by its equipment. Those included a wildfire last year that killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise, ranking as California's deadliest wildfire on record.
BLACKOUTS FOR SAFETY
In recent months, PG&E resorted to widespread power shut-offs that left hundreds of thousands of its customers without electricity for days at a time during periods of extremely high winds and dry conditions.
But the blackouts enraged consumers, regulators and politicians, including Newsom, who accused PG&E of failing through greed and mismanagement to invest in proper maintenance and upgrades of its power system over the years.
PG&E has denied putting profits ahead of public safety but acknowledged it needed to do a better job of protecting the grid from fire hazards.
Newsom had floated the idea of a state takeover of the utility if it failed to satisfy his demands, and has insisted that whatever entity emerges from bankruptcy must be ""completely transformed"" and more accountable.
The governor's finding that PG&E's reorganization plan must comply with the new law, AB 1054, is a prerequisite for the utility's proposed civil settlement with wildfire victims. 
The law creates a wildfire liability fund that investor-owned utilities can access for wildfire claims, provided the utilities contribute toward the fund and make a combined $5 billion, five-year investment toward improvement in their electrical grids.
To participate in the fund, PG&E must exit bankruptcy by June 30, putting intense pressure on the utility to resolve its complicated Chapter 11 quickly.
Prior to its $13.5 billion deal with victims, the company recently reached an $11 billion settlement with insurance companies and a $1 billion settlement with local governments for fire losses. 

Bondholders led by Elliott Management opposed the reorganization plan championed by PG&E. However, the $13.5 billion compensation package agreed to by the utility - more generous than expected - makes it much more difficult for bondholders to upend PG&E's plans.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2019 12:13AM ET</span>",Trade deal removes major hurdle for rally in Apple and tech,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's limited trade deal with China removes a major hurdle for Apple (O:AAPL) and other technology stocks that have already surged this year to record highs. 
The so-called Phase One deal announced, but still not signed, on Friday suspends the planned imposition of new 15% tariffs on Sunday that would have hit $160 billion in Chinese consumer goods just weeks before Christmas, including $115 billion worth of iPhones, laptops and other electronics.
The deal would also see the United States reduce existing tariffs on other goods. China has agreed to boost imports of U.S. energy, pharmaceutical and agricultural products, although Chinese officials offered no details on the amount of U.S. goods Beijing had agreed to buy.
If it is signed, Trump's long-awaited deal will be a relief to Apple, among the U.S. companies with the most to lose in the trade war between the world's two largest economies, along with chipmakers who make the components in its devices, which are mostly made in China. 
""The Street has been laser focused on this additional 15% next round of tariffs and we believe this ultimately signals a green light for tech stocks heading into year end with the impending $160 billion tariff no longer a near-term concern,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note on Friday.
Ives estimated that the tariffs that would have hit iPhone imports on Sunday would have clipped about 4%, or 50 cents, off of Apple's 2020 earnings per share.
Even amid trade uncertainty, Apple surged over 70% this year to all-time highs on broad investor confidence in recent months that Washington and Beijing would eventually strike a deal. Apple's stock has also benefited from progress increasing its services revenue as it diversifies from declining iPhone sales.
Confidence the trade war would be settled has also pushed the S&P 500 (SPX) up 26% in 2019 and fueled a 44% rally in the information technology sub-index (SPLRCT).
Still, Investors are divided over whether Trump's trade deal is fully priced into the market, or whether shares of Apple, its suppliers, like Qorvo (O:QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (O:SWKS), and other U.S. technology and trade-sensitive stocks have room to rise.
The S&P 500 edged up 0.01% on Friday to close at its second record high in two days, while Apple rose 1.36% to an all-time high. Chip stocks including Qorvo and Advanced Micro Devices (O:AMD) sold off from recent record highs.
""I wouldn't be surprised to see some profit-taking,"" said Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""On the other hand, the deal could really give corporate management better visibility into the economic outlook, and help them start spending again.""
Reflecting Wall Street's mostly upbeat view toward Apple, BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan on Wednesday raised his price target on the company, predicting the eventual rollout of 5G would drive three years of robust iPhone sales. 
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) has surged 56% in 2019, as the rollout of 5G wireless technology appeared likely to end a downturn in global chip demand and on confidence the trade war would be resolved. The global chip market is set to recover by 5.9% in 2020 after shrinking 12.8% this year, according to a forecast by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics.
But gains in technology stocks have stretched their earnings multiples, increasing the risk should their bottom lines not grow next year as much as expected, or should Trump's trade deal sour. The S&P 500 information technology sector is trading at over 20 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since 2005, according to Refinitiv. 
Earnings for the tech sector are expected to grow by about 10% next year after falling 1% in 2019, according to Refinitiv's I/B/E/S data. That is mostly in line with broader expectations for the S&P 500, with analysts predicting around 10% profit growth next year, up from 1% in 2019. 
""Markets are clearly seeing through this year’s flat S&P earnings and expect much better results in 2020,"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, wrote in a note.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 09:53PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hudson's Bay's take-private deal falls short - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC) has fallen short of securing enough shareholder support for a C$1.9 billion($1.4 billion) deal to take the department store operator private, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
A buyout consortium of Hudson's Bay investors led by its Executive Chairman Richard Baker did not win enough votes from other company shareholders by a Friday morning deadline in advance of a Dec. 17 special meeting, the sources said.
The sources cautioned that shareholders are allowed to change their mind up to the time that the special meeting of shareholders is held, however.
The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) regulator on Friday said Hudson's Bay has agreed to postpone the Dec. 17 meeting. It was not immediately clear when this would now be held.
The OSC also dealt Baker another setback by ordering Hudson's Bay to revise the disclosures it made to its shareholders on Nov. 14 on how the deal with Baker was put together.
Representatives for Hudson's Bay and Baker's consortium did not respond to requests for comment.
Baker has argued that Hudson's Bay would be better positioned as a privately held company to face the brick-and-mortar retail sector's challenges, shielded from the demands and concerns of stock market investors amid the rising popularity of online shopping.
While Baker's offer would pay Hudson's Bay shareholders a 62% premium to the value of their stock prior to his bid being announced, it values the company at just a third of its 2015 worth. That has triggered opposition from some Hudson's Bay investors, including Canadian private equity firm Catalyst Capital Group Inc and hedge fund Ortelius Advisors LP.
The buyout consortium has 57% voting control over the company, but a majority of the shareholders not involved with Baker's consortium must approve the offer for the deal to be completed. 
Catalyst, which owns roughly 17.5% of the retailer, made an offer of C$11.00 per share for Hudson's Bay that a special board committee negotiating on behalf of the company rejected because Baker's consortium said it was not willing to allow the sale of the company to another party. 
Hudson's Bay's agreement to sell itself to Baker's consortium is for C$10.30 per share. An independent valuation report by real estate services firms  CBRE  Group Inc (NYSE:CBRE) and Cushman & Wakefield Plc valued Hudson's Bay real estate at $C8.75 per diluted share, helping Baker's push to convince the special board committee to a deal closer to his offer.

Hudson's Bay shares ended trading up 2.7% at C$8.88 in Toronto on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trade groups representing major technology companies and advocacy groups on Friday asked a U.S. appeals court to reconsider its October ruling that largely upheld the 2017 repeal of landmark net neutrality rules.
The Federal Communications Commission in December 2017 reversed Obama-era rules prohibiting internet service providers (ISPs) from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes, a blow to large tech companies and consumer groups that had championed net neutrality.
In petitions filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Friday, the Computer & Communications Industry Association, internet trade group INCOMPAS and various advocacy groups asked the three-judge panel to rehear the case or the full appeals court to take up the issue.
""The decision presents an issue of exceptional importance, as it affirms the reversal of U.S. policies promoting the open Internet, and the repeal of the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rules,"" said one of the petitions.
Members of the trade groups include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. Advocacy groups filing petitions include Public Knowledge, Free Press and the Center for Democracy & Technology.
""The FCC abdicated its ability to regulate the behavior of ISPs for the first time in its history. As a consequence, ISPs are permitted to block or throttle Internet access, demand pay-to-play ransom from Internet edge providers, or otherwise interfere with end users’ access to the Internet,"" the petition said.
FCC spokeswoman Tina Pelkey said the agency is confident the court's decision ""will stand and that we will continue to have a free and open Internet moving forward.""
The appeals court, in its October decision, also ruled the FCC erred when it declared that states cannot pass their own net neutrality laws and ordered the agency to review some key aspects of its 2017 repeal of rules set by the Obama administration, including public safety implications and how its decision will impact a government subsidy program for low-income users.
The 2017 FCC 3-2 vote handed internet providers sweeping powers to recast how Americans use the internet, as long as they disclose changes. The new rules took effect in June 2018 but ISPs have yet to change how users access the internet.
In April, the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted to reinstate net neutrality protections, but the measure has never been considered by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. Democratic senators on Tuesday were blocked in their bid to seek consideration."

(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co on Friday said it won a $752 million jury verdict against  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) in a U.S. patent dispute relating to technology for treating cancer. 
A jury in Los Angeles awarded the damages after finding that Yescarta, a treatment sold by Gilead's Kite Pharma unit, infringed on a patent exclusively licensed by Bristol-Myers' Juno Therapeutics division.
The patent at issue in the lawsuit, which Juno licenses from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, relates to CAR T-cell immunotherapy for cancer.
CAR-T therapy involves a process of removing T cells from a patient's immune system, engineering them to better identify and attack cancer cells and infusing them back into the patient.
Bristol-Myers said in a statement that it was pleased with the verdict.
Gilead disagreed with the decision.
""We remain steadfast in our opinion that Sloan Kettering's patent is not infringed and is invalid,"" Gilead said in a statement. ""Given that Kite independently developed Yescarta and assumed all of the risk in its discovery and development, we do not believe Sloan Kettering and Juno are entitled to any level of damages.""
Gilead said it expected to seek to undo the verdict through post-trial motions and an appeal.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration special crash investigation program will investigate the Dec. 7 crash of a 2018 Tesla Model 3 on Interstate 95 in Norwalk, Connecticut, the agency confirmed.

Autopilot has been engaged in at least three fatal U.S. Tesla crashes since 2016. The agency’s special crash investigation team has inspected 12 crashes involving Tesla vehicles where it was believed Autopilot was engaged at the time of the incident. To date, the agency has completed reports on two of them: a 2016 fatal crash in Florida in which Autopilot was engaged and a prior crash where Autopilot was ruled out as a factor.

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 06:14PM ET</span>","Facebook, privacy activist Schrems battle nears end on Dec. 19","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems' seven-year battle against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reaches a crucial point on Dec. 17 when an adviser to Europe's top court will issue his view on whether tools used by companies to transfer data abroad are legal or not.
At stake are standard contractual clauses used by Facebook and hundreds of thousands of companies, ranging from banks to industrial giants to carmakers, to transfer personal data to the United States and other parts of the world.
Another issue is whether the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which came into existence in 2016 and designed to protect Europeans' personal data transferred across the Atlantic for commercial use, is lawful or not.
Schrems, an Austrian law student, who successfully fought against the EU's previous privacy rules called Safe Harbour in 2015, challenged Facebook's use of standard clauses on the grounds that they do not offer sufficient data protection safeguards.
Facebook's lead regulator, the Irish Data Protection agency, took the case to the Irish High Court which then sought guidance from the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
The opinion by Henrik Saugmandsgaard Øe, advocate general at the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union, is non-binding. However, judges follow such recommendations in four out of five cases. The court will rule in the coming months.
The case has implications for companies because the transfer measures are essential in ensuring the free flow of data to non-EU countries, said Jamie Drucker at UK-based law firm Bristows.
""They underpin some of the most significant business operations, including outsourced services, cloud infrastructure, data hosting, HR management, payroll, finance, and marketing,"" he said.

If the Court invalidates the measures, ""this would mean they (companies) would either need to suspend transfers of personal data to these countries or risk breaching the GDPR and exposing themselves to significant revenue based fines,"" Drucker said.
Landmark privacy rules known as GDPR adopted last year gives privacy watchdogs the power to fine companies up to 4% of their global annual revenue for violations.
The case is C-311/18 Facebook Ireland and Schrems

(Reuters) - T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc Chief Executive John Legere testified on Friday that he believes U.S. regulators considered Dish Network's history of attempting to build a wireless network when they approved the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint Corp.
A group of U.S. states have sued to stop the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices.
T-Mobile and Sprint have already received approval for the deal from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), after the companies agreed to sell Sprint’s prepaid phone business and some spectrum to satellite TV provider Dish, which has committed to building a nationwide wireless network and becoming a competitor in the industry.
The states have argued that Dish has a history of stockpiling FCC licenses for wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, and has not yet demonstrated that it can build a wireless network.
Legere was the defense's first witness, and his testimony came on the fifth day of a trial that is expected to run until Dec. 20. He has previously accused Dish of ""hoarding"" spectrum.
Glenn Pomerantz, an attorney representing California in the lawsuit, asked Legere about a letter T-Mobile previously sent to the FCC, criticizing Dish's wireless business plans as a ""modernized version of last century's two-way paging.""
Legere testified that he believed the FCC considered Dish's track record when it approved the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.
Under the terms with the FCC, which has given the green light to the T-Mobile and Sprint merger, Dish committed to build a 5G wireless network that will cover at least 70% of the U.S. population by June 2023, or it will pay up to $2.2 billion in fines."
1616,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 05:59PM ET</span>",Italian lender Popolare di Bari put into special administration,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Stefano Bernabei
ROME (Reuters) - The Bank of Italy placed Banca Popolare di Bari  under special administration on Friday as a crisis at the cooperative lender heaped pressure on the shaky coalition government headed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
The bank, which said this week it needed an urgent injection of up to 1 billion euros, has struggled to cope with mounting loan losses during a slump that has devastated Italy's economy, notably in Popolare di Bari's home region in the south.
Only hours before an urgent cabinet meeting on Friday night, Conte said the banking system was in good health and there would be no need for state bailouts, prompting the right wing opposition League party to call on him to resign.
Treasury sources said the cabinet discussed plans to boost the capital of the state-owned Banca del Mezzogiorno-Mediocredito Centrale to allow it and the Interbank Deposit Protection Fund (FITD) deposit guarantee scheme to take part in a rescue of Popolare di Bari.
But the meeting ended without approving an expected emergency decree amid tensions between the main coalition partners, the anti-establishment 5 Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party (PD).
Instead the prime minister's office issued a statement saying the government was determined ""to guarantee full protection for the savings of citizens and to reinforce the lending system"".
Popolare di Bari, the largest bank in the south, is one of two remaining large cooperative lenders which are yet to embrace a 2015 government reform aimed at improving governance and management accountability.
With 5 Star and the PD at loggerheads over a growing list of economic issues, from the fate of airline Alitalia to the troubled Ilva steel plant in southern Italy, the crisis has potentially explosive implications for the government.
Like thousands of Italians who invested savings in the shares and bonds of local banks, Popolare di Bari's 69,000 shareholders stand to lose their money in a rescue.
Five Star issued a statement saying it wanted ""to rescue savings, not banks,"" while Dario Franceschini, a senior member of the PD, dismissed ""the threats and attacks of allies"". 
Popolare di Bari Chief Executive Officer Vincenzo De Bustis said in a newspaper interview this week that the bank's problem debts amounted to a quarter of its loan book, blaming poor lending practices.
Popolare di Bari said last week it aimed to approve a business and capital plan within weeks.
The bank has submitted a preliminary request for help to FITD, which rescued Carige. The fund said it needed to examine Popolare di Bari's business plan before getting involved.
A source close the fund said its board could meet before Christmas to discuss a rescue.
Shareholders in cooperative banks have one vote each regardless of the size of their stake, a system which critics say has placed the banks under undue local influence.

(Reuters) - NBCUniversal Chief Executive Steve Burke will step down next year and be replaced by NBCUniversal Film and Entertainment Chairman Jeff Shell (LON:RDSa), a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
The executive shuffle comes as the Comcast Corp-owned (O:CMCSA) news and entertainment company prepares to wade into the streaming war with a new advertising-supported service, Peacock. It will be one of the last entrants in an industry occupied by tech and media giants Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS). AT&T Inc (N:T) is set to launch its HBO Max streaming service next May. 
Peacock is expected to launch in April; NBCUniversal is expected to discuss it at an investor and press meeting in January.
Burke, whose contract ends August 2020, is not expected to seek another job at Comcast nor will he go to another company, the source said, shooting down speculation that he was considering a role at Comcast, possibly to run UK-based pay TV service Sky.
An NBCUniversal representative declined to comment. The executive move was first reported by Variety.
Burke joined Comcast in 1998 and ran its cable division during a period of rapid expansion of its high-speed internet service. He became CEO of NBCUniversal by 2011 after Comcast took control of the media company from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) in 2010. Before Comcast, Burke spent over a decade at Disney.
Shares of Comcast closed up 1.3% at $43.58 on Nasdaq on Friday.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 05:08PM ET</span>",Boeing bows out of multibillion-dollar Minuteman missile replacement competition,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has decided not to compete as a prime contractor to replace the Pentagon's aging U.S.-based Minuteman III missile system, paving the way for  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) to win a contract worth tens of billions of dollars. 
Friday marked the deadline to submit proposals to continue work on the replacement of the nearly half-century-old intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system as the military embarks on a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons.
Boeing said in a statement that it was disappointed it was unable to submit a bid. Northrop said it had submitted its proposal. No other bidders were expected.
Boeing's decision not to enter a bid as a prime contractor had been foreshadowed this summer in a letter from the chief executive of Boeing Defense Space and Security, Leanne Caret, to Air Force leadership, saying Northrop's 2018 purchase of solid rocket motor maker Orbital ATK might make it difficult for Boeing to compete on cost.
Orbital is the top producer of the solid fuel rocket motors generally used in Minuteman III and similar missiles.
Upgrading the U.S. nuclear force was expected to cost more than $350 billion over the next decade as the United States works to replace its bombs, nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. Some analysts estimated the cost of modernization at $1 trillion over 30 years.
The Pentagon's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office has said the total cost to replace Minuteman III could top U.S. $85 billion.

Stocks finished with very small gains Friday, led mostly by tech stocks. The rest of the market struggled.
The S&P 500 was basically flat, although the index did finish with a record close of 3,168.80. The Dow industrials rose 0.01%, or 3 points, as gains for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),   American Express   (NYSE:AXP) and others were offset by struggles for Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares.
The Dow finished the day about 29 points below its peak close of 28,164 on Nov. 27.
All of the major indexes hit intraday peaks soon after the open but then faded.
The Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.25%. Both were record closes. The gains were basically due to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Declines in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), facing antitrust concerns, chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which reported weak earnings, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), subtracted 11 points from the index.
 
The hangover was probably a result of traders (or their computers) buying the rumor (the U.S.-China trade deal was coming), and then selling the news (the trade deal is here).
There was also disappointment in a retail sales report from the Commerce Department coming in lower for November than expected.
Except that it won't be signed until January and texts weren't available to show the details. The deal includes Chinese purchases of grains and other farm products and a commitment to crack down on patent piracy and other measures. In return, the U.S. agreed to reduce tariffs on $120 billion in products to 7.5% from 15%. That reduction will take effect 30 days after the agreement is signed. New tariffs that had been scheduled for Dec. 15 won't go into effect.
While President Donald Trump crowed about the deal, other officials, including economic advisor Larry Kudlow, were surprisingly wary of it. The deal will offer some confidence for business, Kudlow told CNBC Friday afternoon, but ""we will see how it works. We will see if the Chinese stay with their word.""
And U.S. stocks didn't move higher after Britain's Tory Party scored their big electoral victory Thursday. British stocks rallied on the news with the benchmark FTSE 100 up 1.1%.
The market overall ended the week with small gains -- about 0.4% for the Dow, 0.7% for the S&P 500 and 0.9% for the Nasdaq.
With 11 trading days left in 2019, the S&P 500 is up 26.4% for the year. The Dow is up 20.6%, and Nasdaq is up 31.6%. The year-to-date gains are the best for the indexes since 2013. 
Gold  moved up on the trade deal's uncertainties. Agricultural futures were higher. Soybean futures rose nearly 1% in Chicago to $9.075 a bushel on the trade news. Soybeans are up only 1.4% on the year and are still down 35.6% from their close at the end of 2012. 
Oil jumped with West Texas Intermediate crude settling above $60 a barrel for the first time since July, a signal that traders see OPEC's moves to cut production pushing prices higher.
East Coast utility PPL (NYSE:PPL), Gulf Coast electric utility CenterPoint Energy (NYSE:CNP), software giant Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), cell-phone tower company SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) and software company   Intuit   (NASDAQ:INTU) were among the top S&P 500 performers. 
  Hanesbrands   (NYSE:HBI), cosmetic company Coty (NYSE:COTY), fashion retailer L Brands (NYSE:LB), athletic foot ware retailer   Foot Locker   (NYSE:FL) and chip maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) were the weakest S&P 500 companies.
Interest rates shot up Thursday, as stocks rallied on the trade news. They fell on Friday. The 10-Year Treasury yield fell to 1.823% from Thursday's 1,899%."

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 04:11PM ET</span>",Sarepta shares surge after surprise approval of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy drug,"By Tamara Mathias
(Reuters) - Shares of  Sarepta  Therapeutics Inc (O:SRPT) soared 36% on Friday after U.S. regulators shocked Wall Street by approving the company's treatment for a muscle-wasting disorder less than four months after rejecting the drug over safety concerns.
The Food and Drug Administration in August declined to approve the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) treatment, Vyondys 53, citing a risk of infection and kidney toxicity.
Sarepta in a statement said it had appealed the FDA rejection through a formal dispute resolution request.
Sarepta said it addressed the kidney toxicity issue in the drug's label, which recommends monthly monitoring of patients.
In making its decision, the FDA said late on Thursday it ""considered the potential risks associated with the drug, the life-threatening and debilitating nature of the disease and the lack of available therapy.""
Data from trials showed Vyondys 53 was ""reasonably likely"" to predict clinical benefit in patients with DMD although such benefit, including improved motor function, had not been established, the FDA said.
The approval is contingent on results of a post-approval trial expected to conclude by 2024, the FDA said.
HC Wainwright analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay found the FDA reversal to be confounding.
If the drug ""was not approvable four months ago, it cannot suddenly become approvable without significant new data, and potentially reflects some contrived decision making within the agency,"" Chattopadhyay said.
Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said the change of heart could have implications for Biogen Inc's (O:BIIB) Alzheimer's drug, aducanumab.
Biogen scrapped development of aducanumab in March, but seven months later surprised investors by saying it would pursue approval after analyzing additional data that showed it had some benefit. Wall Street has forecast annual aducanumab sales of nearly $4 billion by 2024.
The surprise approval was not the first for Sarepta.
In 2016, the FDA approved the company's first DMD treatment, Exondys 51, bowing to intense pressure from patient advocates even as an outside panel of experts and the agency's own reviewers questioned the drug's effectiveness.
Sarepta must still submit additional data on the efficacy of Exondys to the FDA. The company's chief executive in November said it expects to provide additional updates to regulators by the end of next year.
Citi Group analyst Joel Beatty said it was now more likely Sarepta will be able to win approval for Duchenne treatment casimersen and gene therapies it is developing.
Company shares, which were cut by half after the August rejection, jumped to $136 on Friday from a Thursday close of $100.46."

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - For SoftBank Group Inc, financial technology firm OneConnect's IPO should have been a vindication of an aggressive China investing strategy.
Instead, embarrassed bankers had to slash the offering size and cut its price as investors baulked at a business model seen too reliant on majority owner Ping An Insurance. The IPO valued OneConnect at $3.7 billion, about half its worth last year when SoftBank's Vision Fund invested $100 million, and its stock was down slightly in its debut on Friday.
OneConnect Financial Technology is just one of many China bets placed by the Japanese investment giant or its massive Vision fund which have run into trouble. That's added to global woes for SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, under fire for bad judgement and insufficient due diligence, exemplified by U.S. office-space startup WeWork's disastrous IPO attempt and subsequent bailout.
In ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance Co Ltd's 2017 IPO, for example, SoftBank ploughed in $550 million as a cornerstone investor. But the deal was seen by some investors as way overvalued and now trades at about half its IPO price.
Its unlisted portfolio has also had problems. The Vision Fund in February invested $1.5 billion in Guazi.com, valuing the second-hand car dealing platform at more than $9 billion.
But a $500 million funding round for Guazi.com in the first half of the year failed to get off the ground, people with knowledge of the fundraising said.
The people, who were not authorized to speak to media and declined to be identified, said potential investors thought it was too pricey and were put off by its lack of profits in a sector where sales have been declining.
Guazi.com said in a statement that talks for new funds were advanced, investors included the Vision Fund and other top international investment institutions and that it expected to be profitable in the fourth quarter.
In fairness to SoftBank, many China IPOs have stumbled, hurt by a sharp slowdown in economic growth and trade tensions with the United States.
But investors and some bankers looking at China-related deals say SoftBank's involvement, once a sign of promising prospects, was now viewed as a red flag that a company was likely overvalued.

Other big bets like TikTok owner ByteDance and artificial intelligence firm Sensetime are threatened by the fallout from the U.S.-China trade conflict. The Vision Fund has invested roughly $1 billion in both, sources have said.
ByteDance is entangled in a U.S. national security review over how it handles U.S. customer data.
Sensetime in October was added to the U.S. ""entity list"" which bars it from buying U.S. components without U.S. government approval, over its alleged involvement in human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang.
Sensetime has countered it abides by all relevant laws of jurisdictions in which its operates and that it has been actively developing an AI code of ethics.
Ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing, one of SoftBank’s biggest China bets with $11.8 billion invested, appeared to have a bright future after U.S. rival Uber (NYSE:UBER) traded its China business for a stake in Didi.
But the rape and a murder of a Didi passenger by her driver has dented the company's image, and its IPO timetable remains unclear after Uber valuations slid.
The Vision Fund opened a China office this year led by former Silver Lake managing director Eric Chen. Two sources familiar with the operation told Reuters that the pace of hiring for the China team has been slow, though SoftBank says the team has grown a lot since March to include about 20 investment professionals.
One source said Chen had scaled back the size of the deals he was looking at, now focusing on investments of around $50 million compared to those of $200 million-$300 million.
SoftBank declined to comment.
It's all a far cry from just two years ago, when SoftBank and the Vision Fund were ramping up. Son had made a killing with an early investment in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) - a stake now worth $140 billion - and the China tech business was booming.
Then, Son's penchant for splashy checks to help startups grow fast and quickly vanquish rivals was in full force - as evidenced by a meeting with Chinese online medical platform Ping An Good Doctor in late 2017 to discuss pre-IPO fundraising.
""How much do you want to raise in the pre-IPO round and via IPO? "" Son asked Good Doctor's CEO Wang Tao, according to sources.
Wang told him it would be $300 million and $1 billion respectively.
""How about I give you $1 billion and you drop the listing plans?"" Son said.
Wang later decided not to take him up on the $1 billion, receiving instead $400 million from the Vision Fund in a pre-IPO round before listing in Hong Kong last year.
In contrast to some of SoftBank's other China investments, its stock has made progress after a rocky start, however, climbing and mostly staying above its IPO price since October."

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - French shareholders in the planned merger of PSA and  Fiat  Chrysler are seeking reassurances that they will retain a numerical advantage on a combined board if CEO Carlos Tavares leaves, two sources close to PSA said.
The two companies are finalising talks after announcing a plan for a $50 billion merger of equals in October that would create the world's fourth-largest automaker.
Under the terms of the draft Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), PSA (PA:PEUP) and Fiat Chrysler (MI:FCHA) would each have five seats on the board of the merged entity. 
An eleventh seat would go to Tavares, who is chief executive of PSA and is set to take on the same role in the new group.
French shareholders view the seat held by Tavares as giving them the de-facto role of senior partners and want to know this advantage would be preserved in the event of him leaving, the sources told Reuters on Friday.
There is no evidence that the issue has surfaced in talks as an obstacle to the deal and a source close to FCA said the draft agreement over the new group's governance was not being questioned and that there was no issue delaying the deal.
PSA, the maker of  Peugeot  and Citroen, has called a meeting of its supervisory board for Tuesday which could discuss the FCA deal, two separate sources had said.
Both firms have said they were confident of reaching a merger deal by the end of the year, but the sources said the French partners were seeking clarification on the issue before a MoU sealing the deal is signed.
Shareholder advisory company Proxinvest said in a note that the French group's shareholders were paying ""an implicit control premium (...) while there was no real control of PSA on FCA"".

PSA, the BPI public investment bank representing the French government's shareholding and FCA, declined to comment.

(Reuters) - Philip Morris' (N:PM) new UK life insurer, Reviti, is looking to take its ""get a discount if you vape"" model to Japan, where the tobacco giant has a more than 70% share of the heat-not-burn market.
Reviti Chief Executive Dan Pender told Reuters that the insurer was spending time looking at the Japanese market because it has a significant number of people who smoke and boasts many vaping products.
""We think the Reviti proposition would work extremely well for Japanese consumers,"" he said.
Most insurers have long treated smokers and vapers the same, meaning they can pay close to double the premiums of non-smokers. Reviti, however, offers a discount of up to 15% for vapers in Britain. Customers who quit tobacco and nicotine altogether get a discount of up to 50%.
Pender said the insurer was working with a number of established Japanese insurers and looking at how to launch.
Philip Morris' iQOS heat-not-burn product dominates Japan, which has emerged as a fertile test ground for the vaping industry, offering opportunities for the start-up insurer to grow.
 British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) has said it would launch two new tobacco heating products in Japan.
Pender said Reviti could disrupt the market in Japan, where most life insurers work on aggregate rates, meaning they do not distinguish between smokers and non-smokers in terms of prices.
""If you've got somebody who is a heavy smoker and they say I kind of know smoking is bad for me, but my insurance premium is the same for someone who doesn't smoke, explain that to me,"" he said.
Reviti's move to Japan comes as deaths in the United States from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping have risen to 52.
Health concerns about vaping have grown despite evidence showing e-cigarettes help smokers to quit, and have led to bans in some countries including India and Brazil."

LONDON (Reuters) - The scale of Boris Johnson's election victory on Thursday may be enough to draw back billions of pounds of investment that have sidestepped UK stocks for years over Brexit, mirroring the U.S. market surge seen after Donald Trump's election three years ago.
With an unexpectedly large 80 seat majority in parliament, the resounding win for British Prime Minister Johnson, who campaigned largely on a slogan of pushing his Brexit deal through in January, could mark a critical turning point for UK equity - the laggard of developed world stock markets over the last decade.
Not only does the size of the majority bring some clarity to the Brexit fog, but money managers say it may well allow Johnson room to face down more extreme elements of his fractious Conservative Party and negotiate a relatively quick trade deal with Brussels involving softer terms than many had feared only a week ago.
If so - and combined with a government spending stimulus in an early post-election budget - the signal to small businesses, the wider UK economy and foreign investors could be electric.
Companies with strong exposure to the domestic economy have been a no-go zone for investors ever since Britain voted in 2016 to exit the European Union, a factor that has led to massive outflows out of equity funds.
Several asset managers have been underweight on UK stocks since then, but a slight uptick in sentiment could quickly suck in tens of billions dollars.
""The election result brings to an end the paralysis that has affected Westminster and is a catalyst for investors to reconsider the value available in public UK equity markets,"" Mark Barnett, head of UK equities at Invesco, said.
For more than three years, the looming menace of a disorderly Brexit had acted as a drag on UK stocks which have underperformed their European and U.S. peers since the referendum.
Just a day ago, consensus among analysts was that Johnson would win only a modest majority and that he would have to tread carefully in negotiating a free trade deal with the EU.
""There is clearly pent up investment demand and corporate decision making, which should be unlocked by the result,"" said Richard Staveley, a fund manager at Gresham House Strategic Investment Trust.
""UK equities remain excellent value when compared to many other asset classes, cheap compared to history and other markets – particularly the U.S.""
So when the initial euphoria calms down, what could be a catalyst for the longer-term rethink?
Some signs of how Johnson reshapes his top team will be important in signaling how he intends to avoid capture by one faction or another.
And - as per Friday's exchanges - positive noises between London and Brussels about a free trade agreement will be important.
But the ""animal spirits"" of business sentiment alone could be a trigger in themselves.
In the immediate aftermath of Trump's victory, the U.S. small business optimism index, released in Jan 2017, posted its biggest rise in 30 years. The S&P 500 (SPX) soared 20% that year.
In the UK, investors will be keenly looking into similar signals from business sentiment surveys, such as the Purchasing Managers' Index as soon as January.
British finance minister Sajid Javid said on Friday investors had already decided to put money into the United Kingdom.
Scott Theil, chief fixed-income strategist at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), said it's not just investors returning to the market.
""Within the UK, you are going to have more commitment of capital to projects and businesses than we've had previously.""
CHEAP AND UNLOVED TO FAIR AND LOVED
For years, UK companies exposed to the domestic economy such as housebuilders, banks, retailers and utilities have been under pressure and were under-owned in global asset managers' portfolios.
Johnson's win boosted housebuilding stocks  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW), Berkeley Holdings (L:BKGH) and  Persimmon  (L:PSN) to record highs on Friday.
Allocations to UK equities had hit record lows of 7.5% in September when the no-deal Brexit was among top possibilities, according to Copley Fund Research, which tracks more than 400 funds managing $800 billion in assets. Before the referendum, allocations were around 9.2%.
""I remain convinced that domestically orientated equities, which are trading at historic discounts whilst offering sustainable growth in income at very attractive yields, offer the greatest risk adjusted opportunity to investors,"" Invesco's Barnett said.
Twelve month price-to-earnings ratios of UK equities are far below their 30-year average, signaling the upswing potential for the assets as and when Brexit uncertainty completely fades and fiscal stimulus kicks in.
""In general, there is a combination of a lifting of uncertainty and valuations, both at a currency level and also at an industry level, that makes investment in the UK attractive and I think that's going to be the important driver of valuations,"" BlackRock's Theil said.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 01:25PM ET</span>",Bloomberg climate plan would halve U.S. carbon emissions in 10 years,"By Timothy Gardner
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg on Friday unveiled a climate plan to slash U.S. carbon emissions by 50% in ten years, by slapping tougher pollution standards on new gas-fired power plants and replacing coal with cleaner energy sources like wind and solar.
The billionaire former New York City mayor has been active on climate change for years.
The plan catches him up to a crowded field of Democratic presidential hopefuls who have already detailed aggressive plans https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-climate-factbox/factbox-climate-policies-of-top-u-s-democrats-in-2020-presidential-race-idUSKCN1VP15A to eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, tapping into what has become a crucial issue for Democratic voters.
Bloomberg announced his candidacy last month, putting him among 15 Democrats vying to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.
""We have to start working as hard as we can building a 100% clean energy economy because the alternative is just too bad for all of us,"" Bloomberg said at a news conference, adding that he believes Trump is ""the wrong person for the job.""
Trump has expressed doubts about the science of climate change, has rolled back climate regulations to boost drilling, and has moved to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement - an international accord to fight global warming.
Bloomberg's plan would target 80% clean energy by 2028, and would be the first of several moves to take the country toward 100% clean energy quickly, ideally before 2045, his campaign said. Most other Democratic candidates also are seeking to move to a green economy within a couple of decades. 
Bloomberg's plan would do so by setting stringent pollution limits on new gas-fired plants, and by ending all subsidies for fossil fuels. Meanwhile, it would create incentives to improve clean-energy technology and invest in poor communities hurt by fossil fuel pollution, or that are struggling to transition to a cleaner energy economy.
In the meantime, Bloomberg said, drillers would likely need to rely on hydraulic fracturing technology to produce fuel.
""I think it's fair to say fracking is the only way we are going to get gas and oil out of the ground,"" he said. ""The real issue is having regulations where they don't have leaks."" 
Other candidates, including U.S. senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, would ban fracking over concerns it can pollute ground water.

In 2011, Bloomberg helped the Sierra Club, a nonprofit green group, launch Beyond Coal, a campaign pressuring U.S. coal plants to shut. He has also funded America's Pledge, a coalition of states, cities and business leaders committed to honoring the 2015 Paris Agreement.

The 106-year firm said in a statement that it was reviewing its funding requirements and various options, following reports of buyers looking at taking a stake. 
The Financial Times reported earlier that Aston Martin has held meetings over recent weeks with Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, other carmakers and potential investors from the Middle East, India and China.
Autocar magazine reported last week that Stroll, owner of Formula One team Racing Point, is preparing to buy a major stake in Aston, whose market capitalisation is now only around 1.27 billion pounds ($1.63 billion). 
As the car industry consolidates through deals such as the  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  (MI:FCHA) merger, Aston has said it does not need to belong to a bigger automotive group, pointing to the success of stand-alone rival  Ferrari  (MI:RACE).
However, the carmaker has seen its shares slump since its flotation in October 2018 as sales have missed expectations.
Some in the global car industry have turned to partnerships, alliances or mergers to handle the challenge of electrification, new technology and tighter margins. 
The sale of a stake could help boost Aston's prospects as it swung to a third-quarter loss last month, saying its full-year wholesale volumes would be lower than previously guided after slumping demand in Europe and Asia.
The company's hopes rest on almost doubling sales with its first SUV, which enters production in 2020, particularly by attracting more female buyers to the brand.
Aston's stock closed 9.5% lower at 556.8 pence. Its shares were priced at 19 pounds in its October 2018 flotation.

1632,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 01:19PM ET</span>",Bankrupt Philadelphia refinery expects second insurance payment,"By Laura Sanicola
(Reuters) - Insurers of Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) have indicated they will make a second payment of $15 million from its property policy in connection to the June fire and subsequent shutdown of the plant, court documents showed.
The payout will be distributed among debtors who were insured under the company's commercial property coverage policy, according to the documents.
Earlier this year, the insurers made an initial $50 million payment to the refiner, which is currently navigating Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
PES entered bankruptcy a month after a June 21 fire and series of blasts destroyed an alkylation unit at its massive refinery complex. Shortly after the blaze, the company requested an advance payment on $1.25 billion in property damage and business interruption insurance coverage, but it was denied.
The plant, which was the largest refinery on the U.S. East Coast, shut its last crude distillation unit in late July.
The refinery has since been put up for sale and has attracted interest from parties ranging from biofuels producers to real estate developers.
The company’s bankruptcy case hinges on receiving insurance proceeds for up to $1 billion for property damage and as much as $250 million for loss of business after the fire, according to earlier filings with the U.S. bankruptcy court for the District of Delaware.
Without the payouts, PES could be forced into Chapter 7 liquidation."

1634,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 01:11PM ET</span>",U.S. and China Agree to ‘Phase-One’ Deal Easing Trade Tensions,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and China said they agreed to the details of the first phase of a broader trade agreement in a move that will see the U.S. reduce tariffs and at least temporarily calm fears of an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
The deal announced hinges on China increasing purchases of American farm goods such as soybeans and pork, and making new commitments on intellectual property and currency. Speaking to reporters in Washington, President Donald Trump said he expects China’s agriculture buying to hit $50 billion annually “pretty soon,” without specifying a timetable.
In return, Trump agreed to reduce some existing U.S. tariffs, halving 15% duties on $120 billion of imports but maintaining a 25% levy on some $250 billion of Chinese goods. He said he would also delay new import taxes set to take effect on Sunday on $160 billion of products such as smartphones and toys.
“This is an amazing deal for all. Thank you!” Trump said in a series of tweets that came as Chinese officials announced the deal at a late-night press conference in Beijing.
The S&P 500 Index swung between gains and losses, while the dollar fluctuated with Treasuries as neither side delivered enough details to calm investors who sent stocks to records Thursday on reports fresh tariffs due Sunday have been averted. Washington and Beijing have been in trade war for almost two years with involving nearly $500 billion in products shipped between the two nations hit by tit-for-tat tariffs.
That mixed market reaction reflected the fact that details of the deal remained murky.
The text agreed by the two sides comprises nine chapters, includes sections on intellectual property, forced technology transfer, food and agricultural products, finance, currency and transparency, boosting trade, bilateral assessment and dispute resolution, Chinese officials said in Beijing. While it had been agreed, Chinese officials said, the text still needed to undergo a review by lawyers on both sides, a normal step for trade agreements. U.S. tariffs would be rolled back in stages, they said.
Ning Jizhe, the vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, stressed that increased agricultural purchases must comply with World Trade Organization rules. “Expanding China-U.S. trade will not affect interests of other trading partners,” he said.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement the agreement also included an enforcement mechanism, though it wasn’t detailed.
The interim deal with China, which was announced as impeachment proceeding against Trump progressed in Congress on Friday, offers a short-term political victory for the president and will allow him to claim that his tariffs have paid dividends. It was hailed by Trump supporters in Congress as well as some former U.S. officials who had tried their own hand at negotiating with China.
“This is the first bilateral trade deal in 20 years -- it was hard fought, hard won and long overdue,” said Hank Paulson, the former U.S. Treasury secretary. “While the issues between the U.S. and China extend far beyond trade, this is a first step toward completing a comprehensive trade agreement.”
Democrats criticized the deal, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying Trump “sold out for a temporary and unreliable promise” from China to purchase soybeans.
Business groups immediately called for more negotiations on future phases to get under way.
“This is an encouraging first phase that puts a floor under further deterioration of the bilateral relationship,” U.S.-China Business Council President Craig Allen said in a statement. “But this is just the beginning. The issues facing the U.S. and China are complex and multi-faceted. They are unlikely to all be resolved quickly.”
Phase Two
Trump said on Friday that negotiations on a second phase of the agreement would begin “immediately.”
“China would like to see the tariffs off and we’re ok with that,”he told reporters. “But they’ll be used as a negotiating table for the phase two deal, which they would like to start immediately and that’s ok with me.”
But many analysts remain skeptical that Trump will be able to conclude those talks on those more intractable issues before the November 2020 election. Chinese officials have privately expressed skepticism that progress can be made past phase one, as have some U.S. business leaders. That has raised questions about the effectiveness of Trump’s strategy and the tariffs that he has rolled out in a way not seen since the 1930s despite the deal announced on Friday.
Some analysts did suggest that the limited scale of the deal may help Trump weather criticism of it from China hawks and others and therefore contribute to the fragile peace holding.
“The reason the president insisted phase 2 will start immediately is phase 1 is very small,” said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute who has advised the Trump administration. “The positive side is that a small deal implemented slowly is much more likely to hold through the election, versus a seemingly big deal falling apart.”
Deal Pressure
Both Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have been under domestic political pressure to get at least a partial deal as a result of the impact of the trade war on both both the U.S. and Chinese economies this year. Many economists have pinned forecasts for a global economic rebound next year on a cease-fire.
China’s gross domestic product rose 6% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace since the early 1990. The U.S. is showing signs of downshifting, too, with a record-long expansion weakening to a crawl this quarter as tariffs spread uncertainty across manufacturers and others whose supply lines run through China.
That damage has put particular pressure on Trump, who is pinning hopes for re-election next year on a solid economy that boasts the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s. He campaigned in 2016 promising to revive American’s decaying manufacturing base -- a sector that’s been among the most disrupted by tariffs."

“The housing market is actually picking up in the U.S. from where it was a year ago. Consumer spending is very strong,” Williams said Friday during a talk in New York. “With the adjustments we’ve already made, lowering interest rates, we’ve got the economy on a very strong footing, sustainable footing, for good growth next year.”
Fed officials voted to leave interest rates unchanged Wednesday at the conclusion of their final policy meeting of 2019 -- following quarter-point cuts at each of their last three meetings -- and signaled they would probably be on hold through the end of 2020. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters afterward that “in order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that’s persistent and that’s significant.”
Some of the risks that led U.S. central bankers to lower borrowing costs in the first place now seem closer to being resolved, Williams said. Earlier Friday, the U.S. and China announced an agreement on trade negotiations that will roll back some tariffs. And in the U.K., a decisive win for conservatives in a general election Thursday reduced uncertainties about the country’s coming exit from the European Union.
Inflation, however, remains muted, despite the ongoing strength of job creation. While the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5% last month, the inflation gauge Fed policy makers watch stood at 1.3% in October. It has been mostly below the central bank’s 2% target since that goal was announced in 2012.
The New York Fed chief referred to the low unemployment rate as “a sustainable place for us to be,” adding that he expected the economy to grow about 2% in 2020, and inflation to head back up to near the 2% goal over the next year or so."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tax-loss harvesting is all about finding losers in your investment portfolio to offset winners so you pay less tax. 
That is not easy in a year when the S&P 500 is up 26%. 
""The best-case scenario is to capture losses when the market is down. Flat is good, too,"" said Robert Holderith, CEO of Green Harvest Asset Management in New York. 
Conventional wisdom is to put this financial task on your to-do list in December, but this year, you need to think a bit broader and more long-term. 
""Waiting to the end of the year is a reactionary tax-planning move when there could have been opportunities throughout the year,"" said certified financial planner Doug Boneparth, who is based in New York.
At year-end, you need to mostly be concerned with your holdings in brokerage accounts. But to keep everything balanced holistically and your tax efficiency maximized, you need to consider your tax-deferred accounts too, like IRAs and 401(k)s. 
For instance, consider weighting your tax-deferred accounts more heavily toward the dividend as well as other yield-producing elements in your portfolio, because when they generate income you will not get taxed right now. 
That leaves you free to hold more growth positions - like exchange-traded index or sector funds - in taxable accounts. ETFs do not distribute capital gains as frequently as traditional mutual funds do, and, therefore, are more tax-efficient. 
Individual investors or their advisers need to monitor how markets fare throughout the year to make sure portfolios are staying on track, looking for market and sector dips driven by the news or other macroeconomic factors, and then sell losers as you go. 
""In March, there were a couple of Presidential candidates talking about healthcare, and that drove healthcare stocks down. So we captured that,"" said Holderith. 
At the very least, advisers say to use the end of the year as motivation to look over your brokerage statements, even if you do not make moves right away. 
Tax-loss harvesting is especially valuable in high-tax states like New York or California. If you were, say, in a 50% combined federal and state tax bracket and you made $50,000 in gains in 2019, you would owe $25,000 on that in taxes. ""If we're able to generate $50,000 in losses, we put that $25,000 back in your pocket,"" said Holderith, whose firm specializes in helping clients through this process. 
The real benefit of saving that money is not immediate, but in how it will grow. In 20 years at average return, you could have $100,000, Holderith added.
ACTION PLAN 
If you are behind the 2019 curve, it might actually be impossible to catch up. 
""In some cases, you might not have any losers, which means you have done all you could,"" said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company in Boston. 
December might not even be the right time to rebalance or re-allocate your portfolio at all, despite these typically being tasks on end-of-year planning lists. 
You might be better off waiting until the new year, said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at independent research firm CFRA. For one thing, if you make trades in December, you will have a tax burden right then and there. If you make your transitions in early January, you delay that tax implication for the next year to the end of 2020. 
""We don’t know what 2020 will bring, but it’s unlikely we'll see another 26% gain again. So you might find other ways to off-set your gains in 2020,"" Rosenbluth said. 
The good news? If you do move things around in your portfolio, you can now find ways to do it without paying commissions on the trades, as major players like Schwab, Fidelity, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade have moved to zero commissions for most online trades. 

""The cost was relatively small before-hand. But now you can do so without having to think about that cost at all,"" Rosenbluth said.

LONDON (Reuters) - UK shares focused on the domestic economy surged on Friday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ruling Conservatives convincingly won a national election, reassuring markets that Britain is likely to be headed for an orderly exit from the European Union.
The FTSE 100 (FTSE) index rose 1.1% as a rally in utilities, retailers, housebuilders and banking stocks offset the drag from sterling, which surged to a 19-month high against the U.S. dollar.
Housebuilders soared, with  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW), Berkeley (L:BKGH) and  Persimmon  (L:PSN) all up about 14%, reaching record highs and topping the blue-chip index.
The FTSE 250 index (FTMC), home to many companies with high UK exposures, surged as much as 5.2% to record highs, before easing slightly to end up 3.4%.
Trading volumes on the FTSE 100 (FTSE) index surged to nearly three times their daily average.
Stocks were benefiting from the Conservative victory and reports of a trade deal between China and the United States, said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""The banking sector, real estate, construction, utilities, all these sectors are expected to benefit from the 'feel-good' factor"".
Johnson's victory lifted nationalisation fears hanging over utility stocks, boosting  National Grid  (L:NG) and  United Utilities  (L:UU), which rose 4.5% and 6.7% respectively.
Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had announced plans to nationalise utilities in his election manifesto.
Corbyn said on Friday he would step down as Labour leader. That decision is likely to be the biggest factor driving banks and utilities higher, by affirming nationalisation is now ""off the table"", said Citi analyst Andrew Coombs.
Among financials, RBS (L:RBS) and Virgin Money (L:VMUK) stood out, rising 8.4% and 18.7%.
JPMorgan's basket of London-listed companies that make their cash in domestic markets rose 6.3% on Friday to record highs.
""I think there has been a huge 'underweight' on UK assets and we are seeing it unwind,"" said Kasper Elmgreen, head of equities at asset manager Amundi. ""UK domestics are attractively priced and there is more way to go.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - The U.S. Attorney leading the investigation of corruption within the United Auto Workers (UAW) told Reuters on Friday the union's leadership still is not fully cooperating with the government, but that individuals are giving federal investigators tips that could expand the probe.
""The deadline is now"" for UAW leadership to be more open with investigators looking into corruption within the union, Matthew Schneider, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan said in an interview.
Schneider said a federal takeover of the UAW is among the options available, but the government's investigation of individuals linked to misuse of union funds and other impropriety is his priority.
With more tips of possible UAW wrongdoing coming in from the public, Schneider said ""we just don't know"" how long it will take to finish the investigation.
The UAW earlier this month installed Rory Gamble, former top union official at  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), as its new president after Gary Jones resigned. Jones has not been charged with wrongdoing, but federal agents searched his home this summer.
Schneider said the union's so-called Article 30 document outlining the case for Jones' removal as president contained information the Justice Department did not know.
""Reading the Article 30 charges and seeing information we didn't know about, that's not open and genuine cooperation,"" Schneider said. ""They're saying we'll respond to any question we’re asked. That’s not cooperation. Cooperation is much more than that.”
The UAW in a statement Friday said it is ""disappointing that Mr. Schneider does not yet recognize the UAW's sincere efforts at reform."" Citing financial reforms announced Dec. 2, the union said that as recently as two weeks ago it had ""expressed a willingness to further work with the government on the issues of concern. And we continue to cooperate in providing the government any and all records requested.""
General Motors Co (N:GM) earlier this month filed a civil racketeering suit against rival  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), charging that Fiat Chrysler executives bribed UAW officials in order to win labor cost advantages over GM.
GM cited evidence from the Justice Department investigation in its brief. Fiat Chrysler has said it will fight GM's charges and characterized them as an effort to slow the proposed merger of Fiat Chrysler and French automaker  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP).
The GM-Fiat Chrysler litigation does not affect the federal criminal investigation, Schneider said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German federal police have arrested two bankers in a widening investigation into the multi-million-euro ""cum-ex"" trading scheme, Frankfurt state prosecutors said on Friday.
A man aged 55 and another of 66 were arrested on suspicion of involvement in a 383 million euro ($422 million) tax fraud at a German bank, the prosecutors said.
Federal police had made the arrests to prevent the men from leaving Germany, the prosecutors added in a statement, which did not name the two individuals.
Last month, a former partner at global law firm Freshfields was also arrested. His lawyer said at the time his imprisonment was unfounded, while Freshfields declined to comment.
The arrests are part of an investigation into Maple Bank, a now defunct group that was based in Frankfurt, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Maple Bank's administrators declined to comment.
German newspaper Handelsblatt first reported the arrests.
The Frankfurt investigation is one in a series of probes across Germany of a scheme that saw investors from around the world target chiefly German companies to generate multiple tax reclaims from phantom dividends, known as cum-ex.
Such trades required a syndicate of big banks and investors to work in tandem to engineer the trades.
In a separate case, two British bankers are being tried in Bonn for their alleged roles in a scheme which one told the court involved ""astronomical"" multi-billion-euro trades.
These trades attracted the attention of German tax authorities after around a decade, who slowly stamped them out.
The revelation of the trades has prompted a heated public debate, a parliamentary inquiry and a pledge from Berlin that to get back the 5 billion euros it estimates was lost.
Judge Roland Zickler, who is overseeing the trial of the British bankers, has described it as a ""collective case of thievery from state coffers"".
Martin Shields, one of the two, said during the trial that the practice was common knowledge in the industry and he had no reason to believe at the time it was legally questionable.
The cases are being closely watched in London and Frankfurt, where much of the trading was organized, bankers say."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders postponed on Friday a package of reforms to safeguard the euro zone from a new crisis, giving finance ministers another six months to work out compromises in discussions that have dragged on since June 2015.
The 19 countries sharing the euro, shaken by the sovereign debt crisis, want to prepare for future trouble better through close integration of banks, a euro zone budget and expanded role for the ESM bailout fund.
But even though this is a slimmed down wish-list, EU leaders failed to agree any of the three elements on Friday.
The leaders' statement said the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers would continue to work on the reforms
Reform of the bailout fund would allow it to lend to the euro zone's bank resolution fund, which arranges the winding down of banks, should it run out of cash in a major crisis.
It would also make it more difficult for investors to block sovereign debt restructuring and allow the ESM to mediate between investors and the sovereign.
Euro zone governments agreed this in June, but Italy withdrew support due to domestic politics and to block a German push to reduce risks posed by bond portfolios in banks.
Germany wants to stop treating government bonds as risk-free and limit the amount of bonds of a single sovereign that a bank can hold to make it less vulnerable.
This is a problem for Italy, whose banks hold a majority of debt issued by the government, but Germany has made this a condition for it agreeing to a euro zone-wide bank deposit insurance scheme.
Leaders also did not make progress on the size of a euro zone budget, which finance ministers proposed at around 17 billion euros ($18.7 billion) over seven years.
Finland, which holds the rotating EU presidency, proposed the money should be part of wider EU funding to equalise living standards between Europe's poorest and richest regions.
""We encourage work to be taken forward on all these issues and will come back to them at the latest in June 2020,"" EU leaders said."

Shares opened at $10.51 compared with its IPO price of $10.
OneConnect, which focuses on small and medium-sized businesses, raised around $312 million on Thursday, selling 31.2 million American depositary shares (ADS).
The company had slashed its IPO size by 28% on Wednesday and lowered its target price range to $9 to $10 per share from $12 to $14 per share.
Analysts said investors would buy SoftBank's inflated private assets in the public market only when they were offered at a lower price.
In October, Softbank-backed infectious disease researcher  Vir Biotechnology Inc  (O:VIR) priced its IPO at the lower end of the target range.
OneConnect, a unit of China's biggest insurer by market value Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd, counts Japan's SoftBank and SBI Group among its main investors.
The company generated sales of 1.55 billion yuan ($220.20 million) in the first nine months of 2019, up 72% from a year earlier. It's losses, however, widened to 1 billion yuan from 579 million yuan, according to the company's prospectus.
Reuters had earlier reported that OneConnect changed the listing venue to New York from Hong Kong a few months earlier, expecting a higher valuation, as massive anti-government protests in Hong Kong made markets jittery.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were among key IPO underwriters."

Last month, Transport for London (TfL) refused to grant the Silicon Valley-based company a new licence due to what it called a ""pattern of failures"" on safety and security, the latest stage of a long-running battle with the authorities.
Uber, which was also denied a licence by TfL in 2017 before a judge restored it on a probationary basis, said it had changed its business model over the last two years and would go further, as it lodged its appeal at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
""We are committed to Londoners and are working closely with TfL to address their concerns and requests, as we have since 2017,"" said the firm's Northern and Eastern Europe boss Jamie Heywood. 
TfL declined to comment. 
The firm's roughly 45,000 drivers in London will still be able to take rides until the appeals process is exhausted, which could take months or even years. 
The regulator said in November that unauthorised drivers were able to upload their photos to other Uber accounts so that on at least 14,000 trips a driver other than the advertised one picked up passengers. 
The Silicon Valley company has run into regulatory barriers and a backlash in several markets, forcing it to withdraw completely from places such as Copenhagen and Hungary.
In London, black cab drivers who see Uber as a threat to their livelihoods have blocked streets in protest, arguing that are being unfairly undercut by an inferior service.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 09:37AM ET</span>",Investors in collapsed Woodford fund to get half their cash in January,"By Carolyn Cohn and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of investors trapped in the former flagship fund of veteran money manager Neil Woodford should get just over half their money back in January, but may have to wait some time to recover more from the collapsed business.
Woodford, who made his name as a contrarian investor over a 30-plus-year career, has come under fire from regulators and investors for the 3 billion pound ($3.85 billion) LF Woodford Equity Income Fund's heavy exposure to unlisted, hard-to-sell stocks.
Trading in the UK-focused fund was initially suspended in June after it ran out of cash to pay back investors seeking to leave after a period of underperformance. Administrator Link Fund Solutions said it would wind up the fund in October, which prompted Woodford to close his firm.
Link said in a letter to investors on Friday that Britain's regulator had approved its plan to wind up the fund, with a final valuation of assets set to take place on Jan. 17. The first payout will be made on or around Jan. 20, it said, with the fund's name changing to LF Equity Income Fund.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), which is selling the more liquid assets on behalf of Link, has sold 56% of the fund, totalling 1.65 billion pounds ($2.12 billion), Link said. BlackRock has reinvested the funds in assets including stock index and money market instruments.
However, Link added that PJT Partners, which is selling the less liquid assets, was still exploring opportunities to sell them.
""Link’s letter indicates that investors are likely to be waiting for some time before they get all their money back,"" said Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment platform AJ Bell. The current valuation of 2.95 billion pounds represents a 19% loss for investors since the fund's suspension, he added.
Woodford investors may lose a third of their money as a result of the winding up of the fund, according to the firm's own estimates.
The quick sale of some of the assets means the fund has been unable to benefit from Friday's post-UK election bounce in a number of shares previously held in size by the fund, which would be ""galling"" for investors, said Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen.
They include housebuilders Barratt (L:BDEV) and  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW), both of which saw double-digit percentage gains on Friday following a strong majority for the ruling Conservatives in Thursday's British elections.
Another former Woodford fund,  Woodford Patient Capital Trust  (L:WPCT) has been renamed Schroder UK Public Private Trust to reflect its change of manager, it said on Friday.
Following the Woodford suspension and the freezing of property funds after the June 2016 Brexit referendum, the Bank of England on Monday is set to update its rules governing withdrawals from funds holding illiquid assets.

But it warned earlier this week that volatility in markets including India, Indonesia and Russia, and supply disruptions from the UK closures could see trading performance worsen further.

A limited range of Mothercare products will be available to buy online at Boots from mid-2020, and a wider range will be available from late summer 2020.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Nvidia (O:NVDA) has not offered any concessions to EU antitrust regulators examining its $6.8 billion bid for Mellanox Technologies (O:MLNX), the European Commission website showed on Friday.
The EU competition enforcer is scheduled to decide on Nvidia's biggest-ever acquisition by Dec. 19. It is not clear if the deal will be cleared unconditionally or will face a full-scale investigation.
Nvidia, known for its powerful gaming graphics chips, declined to comment. Thursday was the last day to offer concessions, if these were required to address any EU antitrust concerns.
The company outbid rival  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) for Mellanox in a move aimed at boosting its data center and artificial intelligence business. Its chips connect data centers into one giant computer.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission risks weakening investor protections if it allows companies to raise money in the public market through a direct listing without the support of underwriting banks, an influential broker group said on Friday.
The warning by the American Securities Association (ASA), a Washington-based group representing regional financial firms, highlights brewing tensions between the stock exchanges that are pushing for direct listings and financial firms that stand to see their fees cut in the capital-raising process.
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has filed an application with the SEC to allow companies going public to raise capital through a direct listing, instead of an initial public offering. Nasdaq has said it also intends to file changes to its rules that would allow companies to raise funds, so-called primary capital, through a direct listing.
Currently, a direct listing does not involve the selling of any new shares and prices the newly public shares on the day they start trading, without the company having to hire investment banks to underwrite the transaction as with a traditional initial public offering.
""While direct listings to raise primary capital may sound good in theory, the reality is that the practice circumvents the diligence process, many of the most important investor protections set forth in the Securities Act, and the very reason the SEC was formed: to protect America's retail investors against fraud,"" the ASA's chief executive, Christopher Iacovella, wrote in a letter to SEC Chair Jay Clayton on Thursday evening, which was seen by Reuters.
Venture capital investors have been pushing for direct listings, saying they are a better way to price newly public shares, while the exchanges say the new mechanism would give companies more flexibility in how they go public after a 20-year decline in listed companies.
But the ASA said in its letter that underwriting banks are important gatekeepers for stocks coming onto public markets, helping to spot fraudulent would-be issuers.
""If the new rule proposals were approved by the SEC, they would fundamentally alter the IPO market, likely increase the number of companies that forego the traditional IPO process, and significantly increase the risks for America's retail investors,"" Iacovella wrote.
The SEC has not commented on whether it would grant the exchanges' request, although Clayton has previously said investor protection is a priority.
To date, there have been two high-profile direct listings, music streaming business Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology SA in 2018 and communication platform Slack Technologies Inc last June. Both had successful market debuts, but their share prices have since sagged."

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 08:24AM ET</span>",How Mexico's leftist president quietly made peace with big business,"By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Barely a day goes by without Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador berating business and political elites, whom he blames for fueling the country's poverty and corruption.
But behind the scenes, the leftist is proving more accommodating to Mexico's top tycoons during his first year in office than his language often suggests.
Meeting regularly with Lopez Obrador, corporate bosses have steered him toward more business-friendly policies, according to more than two dozen senior executives and government officials who spoke to Reuters. Quietly, they have also urged the president to soften some of his rhetoric.
What some business heavyweights describe as an improving relationship yielded fruit in August, when Lopez Obrador backed off a threat to tear up several government contracts awarded to private companies to build and operate natural gas pipelines. The president said the deals ripped off taxpayers. But business leaders warned him the cancellations would spook foreign investors and could disrupt ongoing trade negotiations with the United States, the executives and officials said.
They also told him the infrastructure would help deliver cheap energy to his top priority: Mexico's poorest.
""We used all means of persuasion,"" said Carlos Salazar, head of Mexico's top private sector association, the Business Coordinating Council (CCE), and one of the main mediators on the pipeline dispute.
Elected in July 2018 as Mexico's first left-wing president in over three decades, Lopez Obrador has promised to transform the country by putting the neediest first and slashing inequality.
A firm believer in the reforming power of government, Lopez Obrador has pledged to strengthen Mexico's leading state-run enterprises - oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and power utility the Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE).
His clashes with institutions that check presidential power, from market regulators to the Supreme Court, have unsettled investors. So has his often incendiary rhetoric. He has described money as the ""mother or father of the Devil"" and pilloried “neo-liberal” free market economics as the source of Mexico’s woes hundreds of times.
Still, he has acknowledged publicly that he cannot create jobs, spread wealth and realize his goal of 4% annual economic growth without private capital. Since his term began in December 2018, domestic investment has sagged and the economy has stalled.
The private sector has been largely supportive in public, for fear of antagonizing the 66-year-old president. But in private, many leading executives are still wary of his economic stewardship, said Andres Rozental, a business consultant and former deputy foreign minister.
""They're worried to death about what's going on,"" Rozental said. ""The uncertainty, the disincentivization of private sector involvement in the economy.""
Lopez Obrador says his approach will take time to deliver results. Responding to a question from Reuters, he described his relationship with Mexico's business leaders as ""very good,"" but said some differences of opinion were inevitable. 
""Policy has changed, and now they're adapting,"" he said, without elaborating.
AIRPORT BLUES
Five weeks before taking office, Lopez Obrador stunned investors by canceling a new Mexico City airport, ignoring a plea to keep it going by billionaire Carlos Slim, whose Grupo Carso SAB was a principal contractor.
Lopez Obrador said the $13 billion project was geologically unsound and tainted by corruption; prosecutors have not charged anyone with wrongdoing. The cancellation hammered Mexican financial markets and angered top business groups. Grupo Carso declined to comment on his criticism of the project.
Concerns flared again in late June when power utility CFE said it would renegotiate the seven pipeline contracts signed under the previous government, whose record was marred by graft allegations. The CFE said the $12 billion in contracts were too expensive and imposed harsh terms on the cash-strapped company.
As one of the contractors, Slim's Grupo Carso was once again in the firing line. So were Canada's TC Energy Corp; IEnova, a Mexican unit of U.S. company  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE); and Fermaca, a local gas pipeline operator owned by Swiss private equity firm Partners Group AG.
Canada's ambassador complained. U.S. lawmakers and business groups warned the dispute could jeopardize the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the successor of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has yet to be approved by U.S. or Canadian lawmakers.
As talks between the pipeline firms and the CFE dragged on, CCE boss Salazar and Antonio del Valle, head of the Mexican Business Council, which represents the country's top magnates, held meetings with Lopez Obrador to break the impasse.
Using a map, they explained how the new infrastructure - including a marine pipeline from Texas - would bring affordable gas to Mexico's underdeveloped south, according to a person familiar with the matter. Salazar and del Valle confirmed the map.
In late August, Lopez Obrador announced the CFE had reached a deal with the companies that would realize savings for taxpayers and avoid a messy legal dispute. He thanked Salazar, del Valle and Slim for helping make it happen.
Describing the pipeline accord as a ""watershed,"" del Valle said the talks helped create a mechanism for Mexico's business leaders to address economic matters with the government.
""Now we have the opportunity to participate,"" he said.
Others saw the pipeline settlement not as a breakthrough, but as an example of business leaders saving the president and his allies from their worst instincts.
""They have no idea how close they were to a nuclear disaster in terms of financial markets, in terms of trade talks,"" said one person involved in the pipeline negotiations. 
Lopez Obrador has publicly acknowledged the dispute risked souring investor confidence, but he said the previous contract terms were ""damaging"" to Mexico's interests.
   
GOODBYE 'FIFI'
Another challenge emerged in late May, when U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on all Mexican goods if Lopez Obrador did not curb a surge in migrants trying to cross the U.S. border from Mexico.
Within a week, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard had struck a deal. Salazar and other executives accompanied him to Washington and helped defuse the crisis by working with U.S. business allies who had fought to defend NAFTA from Trump in 2018, people familiar with the matter said. In the end, Trump called off the tariff threat after Mexico agreed to tighten its borders.
That evening, Salazar told local media he had been part of a joint effort and urged business and government to tackle Mexico's problems together. Lopez Obrador publicly thanked Salazar for his efforts.
After the U.S. meetings, business leaders pressed the president to tone down his divisive language, particularly his use of the word ""fifi,"" a derogatory term for privileged elites that some bosses found needlessly provocative, a senior executive told Reuters.
Since then, Lopez Obrador has publicly said he wants to avoid the word; his use of it has dropped dramatically. Asked by Reuters if the change in tone was the result of pressure from corporate bosses, the president denied it.

""I only have one master, just one,"" he said. ""It's the Mexican people.""

1660,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 08:01AM ET</span>",‘All Changed Last Night’: World Traders Fire Up U.K. Inc. Bets,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are ramping up pro-growth trades across U.K. stocks and bonds as a landslide Tory party victory paves the way for a Brexit deal after years of political gridlock.
In Rotterdam, Robeco’s co-head of global macro fixed income Jamie Stuttard is talking up risk-on exposures such as bank debt and those that profit from a steeper government yield curve. In Paris, CPR Asset Management strategist Bastien Drut is considering a return to sterling assets. Arbuthnot Latham in London sees FTSE 250 stocks as a “screaming buy,” according to its co-chief investment officer Gregory Perdon.
“U.K. markets have been haunted by uncertainty for several years now but that all changed last night,” Perdon said. “Markets love clear mandates and that’s what we got.”
Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party is poised for its biggest majority since 1987 under Margaret Thatcher. That bloc of voting support in Parliament gives Johnson a free rein to take Britain out of the European Union in January, breaking the legislative impasse.
Sterling rose by the most since 2017 at one point while stocks and bond yields surged, on expectations that political stability and fiscal stimulus will spur growth and pent-up investment.
“All these years of coalition politics, knife-edge politics -- that era is over,” said Stuttard at Robeco. “You can therefore have some flight-to-quality unwind in the Gilt market.”
The pro-growth bet for Stuttard’s team is being long two-year gilts against 10- and 30-year maturities. He’s also considering returning to a long position in sterling versus the euro. “The big trade for us is a steepener and that’s working for us this morning,” Stuttard said.
Improved investor confidence and a still-cheap currency could fuel more overseas direct investments including buying of London property, he suggests.
While U.K. domestic shares have surged, large-caps listed in the country -- which mostly make money overseas -- have bucked a long-standing negative correlation with the pound to rally in tandem. They were also boosted by a brighter trade outlook aiding cyclical sectors including banks and commodities.
There’s plenty of skepticism among those who say the Brexit saga is only just entering another chapter.
Despite his Parliamentary majority, Johnson still has to contend with hard-liners in his party who are willing to give up EU trading ties to exert greater control on labor and environmental standards. This faction is likely to push for a clean break at the end of next year. A big majority could allow him to cut a deal that keeps the U.K. more closely aligned with the single market.
“The road is full of pitfalls,” said Didier Borowski, the head of macroeconomic research at Amundi, who prefers small, domestically-focused stocks and sees only “short-term relief” for U.K. markets.
Going into the Thursday vote, global funds remain decidedly underweight on U.K. equities, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s monthly fund manager survey. Their allocation has slipped since the Brexit vote, reaching the lowest since at least 1999 at one point earlier last year.
“As of this morning, the British markets are back on the map of international investors,” Arbuthnot’s Perdon said."
1661,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 07:37AM ET</span>","Pulled IPOs cap subdued year for Canadian deals, signal challenges ahead","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - The scrapping of a second Canadian IPO in as many months this week caps a year of declining activity, highlighting the challenges facing issuers as trade uncertainty and the growth of passive investing weigh on new offerings.
The lucrative initial public offerings (IPO) business is unlikely to see a significant pick-up in 2020 as it faces headwinds from challenging economic conditions, which are set to keep equity markets cautious, and from the rise of index funds, investors said.
That is not good news for Canadian banks, many of which have large investment banking operations that suffered declining earnings in fiscal 2019.
Canadian IPOs are down 44% to C$937 million ($704 million) so far this year, on course for their lowest level since 2016, according to Refinitiv data. Banks in North America earn about 6% of IPO value as underwriting fees.
Elliott Management-backed Triple Flag Precious Metals dropped IPO plans on Wednesday, citing lackluster demand from investors.
An economic cycle about a decade into expansion and global trade uncertainties are contributing to investors' ""reticence to get involved in anything that might be perceived as additionally risky,"" said Rick Hutcheon, president and chief operating officer at RKH Investments. 
As the fund management industry undergoes a structural shift with more passive managers investing in index-tracking funds, the appetite for IPOs, particularly involving smaller companies unlikely to be included in benchmarks, will remain subdued, said Bryden Teich, portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management. 
Canadian banks posted an average 11% drop in fourth-quarter earnings from their capital markets businesses versus a year ago, Scott Chan, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, wrote in a note this week.
As capital markets businesses are ""inherently market sensitive, future performance could be adversely impacted by macroeconomic conditions,"" Chan said. 
Last month, waste management company GFL Environment scrapped its listing, which was expected to be Canada's biggest IPO, after institutional investors urged the firm to price its shares below the marketed range.
Mergers and acquisitions have fallen 15% so far this year from 2018 to C$226 billion, while equity deals dropped to C$28 billion, the lowest level in at least five years, according to Refinitiv data.
""Survival mergers,"" where struggling companies combine to cut costs, could drive some pick-up in M&A activity in 2020, Hutcheon said. This has been happening in the gold mining sector and could pick up among battered energy companies, he added. 
BMO Capital Markets (TO:BMO) and  CIBC  World Markets (TO:CM) were the top bookrunners for IPOs this year, according to Refinitiv. 
Goldman Sachs & Co (N:GS) and TD Securities (TO:TD) were the leading financial advisers for M&A deals, while  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  RBC  Capital (TO:RY) topped advisers on secondary equity deals.

China has, however, failed to respond publicly to offer reportedly approved on Thursday by President Donald Trump, under which existing U.S. tariffs on imports from China would be partially rolled back and the new tariffs scheduled for Sunday would be suspended, pending written confirmation of China's commitment to buy fixed volumes of U.S. farm goods.
As such, the threat that the new tariffs, covering $160 billion worth of Chinese goods annually, will come into force as schedule has not been completely lifted.

Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), meanwhile, was set to open lower after losing 2.5% in after-hours trading in response to reporting quarterly revenue that fell short of expectations - even though earnings per share were 2c higher than forecast. The company also said that it wouldn't replace departed co-CEO Mark Hurd, leaving Safra Catz in sole charge at the helm.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 05:25AM ET</span>",California power producer PG&E files amended reorganization plan,"By Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) - California power producer PG&E Corp (N:PCG) said late on Thursday that it has filed for an amended reorganization plan, adding that it remains on track to getting the plan confirmed before a June 2020 deadline to exit bankruptcy. 
The development comes less than a week after the company said it reached a $13.5 billion settlement with victims of some of the most devastating wildfires in California's modern history.
PG&E has settled all major wildfire claims and resolved disputed release provisions between insurance companies and wildfire victims, it said on Thursday.
The company also said its plan can be fully funded through its capital structure, including the $12 billion equity backstop commitments that PG&E received last week. 
The acceptance or rejection of the plan may not be obtained until the approval of a disclosure statement by the bankruptcy court, PG&E's attorneys said in a court filing on Thursday.
On Thursday consumer advocate Erin Brockovich voiced support for the company's reorganization plan. She is known for having fought PG&E in court over water contamination, a case depicted in an Academy Award-winning film starring Julia Roberts.
""This approach will also enable the company to continue to help meet the state's climate and clean energy goals,"" Brockovich said, adding that the plan was compensating the victims fairly.
The utility had previously reached a $1 billion settlement with cities, counties and other public entities and an $11 billion agreement with insurance carriers related to the wildfires.
It filed for Chapter 11 protection in January, citing potential liabilities in excess of $30 billion from wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment.
A probe by a state regulator concluded earlier this month that the company did not properly inspect and replace transmission lines before a faulty wire sparked a wildfire that killed more than 80 people in 2018.
PG&E came under renewed criticism this year for precautionary power outages to guard against the risk of wildfires posed by extremely dry and windy weather, as regulators and consumer activists labeled the company's outages as being too broad without appropriate communication to customers.

Investing.com -- Homebuilders, banks and utilities led the charge higher on Friday as U.K. stocks soared in the wake of an emphatic election victory for the Conservative Party.
The scale of the victory banished the threat of a radical left-wing Labour Party setting the agenda for the foreseeable future, removing a huge question mark over the future of the country’s banks and its privatized utilities in water and energy, as well as train operators.
By 5:20 AM ET (1020 GMT), four of the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 were homebuilders.   Taylor Wimpey   (LON:TW) rose 14.9%, while   Barratt Developments   (LON:BDEV) rose 12.0%,   Persimmon   (LON:PSN) was up 11.1% and Berkeley was up 12%. Midcap builders Bellway and Redrow were also both around 10% higher.
Among the financials, Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) – the bank most exposed to possible interference from a Labour government due to the large residual government stake in the bank – was the biggest winner, rising 11.8%. Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) rose 7.5% and   Barclays   (LON:BARC) rose 8.2%, with the exclusively-U.K. focused midcap CYBG (LON:VMUK) also rising 18%.
U.K.-based asset managers also profited from the perception that the greater certainty on the political front will give retail investors confidence to re-enter a stock market that has been largely moribund since the 2016 Brexit referendum.
As such, retail investment platforms   Hargreaves   Lansdown (LON:HRGV) and   AJ Bell   (LON:AJBA) rose 9.3% and 5.8%, while   Jupiter Fund Management   (LON:JUP) rose 5.4% and St. James’s Place (LON:SJP) rose 6.3%.

The poll victory will allow him to end three years of political paralysis and take Britain out of the European Union within weeks.
Shares in three of the UK’s four biggest supermarket groups -  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) and Morrisons (L:MRW) - were up 4.1%, 3.6% and 2.3% respectively by 0921 GMT, while clothing and food retailer Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) was up 9.4%.
Analysts said pent up consumer demand could find a release in big grocery shops in the lead up to December 25 and higher spending on so called ""big ticket"" items.
The protracted uncertainty around Brexit and the incessant media coverage was strong enough for consumers to reduce volumes in by 100 to 150 basis points, according to Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.
""This is just in time for the most important food retail trading event: Christmas where families traditionally trade up when they feel good,"" he said.

1667,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>","'Out of market today': Australia brandishes four words crucial to case against Citi, Deutsche","By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - A four-word handwritten note by a JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) banker has been seized by Australian prosecutors as fundamental to a criminal cartel prosecution against  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), a court heard on Friday.
The note, which said ""out of market today"", was taken by JPMorgan compliance chief Oliver Bainbridge at the time of a conference call with the other two banks, and prosecutors say it shows the three agreed to refrain from selling stock from a 2015 capital raising to boost its price, the court heard.
""Mr Bainbridge has made contemporaneous notes with the words 'out of market today',"" said Jennifer Giles, a local court magistrate presiding over the case which is yet to go to trial.
Prosecutors say the note ""seems to have been corroborated by what happened in the market,"" Giles added.
Though brief, the note's existence may be used to support a federal case accusing the three banks of agreeing to withhold unsold stock from a A$2.5 billion capital raising for retail lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, misleading retail shareholders and violating cartel laws.
The case, brought by antitrust regulator the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could influence how they are allowed to conduct joint capital raisings.
JPMorgan and several of its staff and ex-staff, including Bainbridge, have agreed to act as prosecution witnesses in exchange for immunity, the court has previously heard.
Defence lawyers have been questioning the JPMorgan witnesses about how they came to cooperate with the authorities, how their signed statements were drafted and who was involved. So far, all of the witnesses said they did not take notes of the conference calls at the heart of the case.
A day earlier, another JPMorgan witness who was on the calls, the bank's local markets head Jeff Herbert-Smith, told the court the banks had not colluded on the capital raising, and that he was surprised when he was approached by the ACCC.
Bainbridge lives overseas and will probably be called to testify in February, the court heard on Friday.
A year and half since the charges were brought, no trial date has been set and none of the accused - Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of their staff and ex-staff - has entered a formal plea, but all have said they will fight the charges which carry prison terms.

The pre-trial hearings will resume in Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court on Jan. 30.

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Shares already trading at record highs piled on the gains and the pound soared on Friday as a last-gasp Sino-U.S. trade deal and a thumping election win by Britain's Conservative Party cleared two of the darkest clouds on the global investment horizon.
The double dose of relief knocked safe-haven sovereign bonds and the Japanese yen, and led markets to scale back the chance of more interest rates cuts around the world.
""Global investors have been given two of the biggest gifts on their Christmas list and should be appreciative for a while at least,"" said Sean Callow, a senior forex analyst at Westpac.
""Global equity indices such as MSCI World should set more record highs and sterling could push above $1.36.""
The pound hit its highest since mid-2018 as exit polls and then a run of UK vote results quickly wiped out any chance of a shock win by the left-wing Labour opposition, which had been a worry for investors.
Prime Minster Johnson won a commanding majority in Britain's Parliament, giving him the power to deliver Brexit, though trade talks with the European Union were set to drag on for months yet.
The pound was up 2.1% at $1.3450 and reached levels against on the euro not visited since mid-2016.
A wave of trade euphoria had already lifted Wall Street to record highs. Reuters reported the United States has agreed to reduce some tariffs on Chinese goods and delay a tranche of tariffs as part of a 'phase one' deal.
China had agreed to make $50 billion in agricultural purchases in 2020, that person and another U.S. source familiar with the talks said.
""If the U.S. cuts the current tariffs to some extent as reported, that is not something markets have priced in, so we could see a further leg up,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities in Tokyo.
LESS NEED FOR MORE CUTS?
Europe's pan-regional STOXX 600 share market (STXEc1) looked set to open almost 1.5% higher on the twin boosts. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei (N225) climbed 2.5% to a 14-month top, while Shanghai blue chips (CSI300) advanced 2%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) jumped 1.5% to its highest since late April.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) rose 0.4% to another peak, though London's FTSE futures (FFIc1) were only up a modest 0.2%, perhaps because a Conservative win had already been priced in, but also because a stronger pound makes British firms' international earnings look less impressive.
On Thursday, Wall Street had celebrated the trade news with record highs. The Dow (DJI) ended Thursday up 0.79%, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.86% and the Nasdaq (IXIC) 0.73%.
That was bad news for bonds, and yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) shot up to 1.91%, a rise of 12 basis points in just two sessions.
Interest rate futures slipped as investors priced in less chance of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next year - a shift seen across a range of developed nations including the UK.
Other safe harbours also took a beating, with the yen sliding across the board. The dollar firmed further to 109.60 yen having risen 0.7% overnight.
The dollar fared less well elsewhere, slipping 0.5% to 96.792 (DXY) against a basket of currencies, as the pound and the euro both benefited from the UK election result.
The dollar hit an 18-week low to the yuan as any trade truce would be seen as a boon for the export-heavy Chinese economy. It was at 6.9607 yuan having shed a steep 1.2% overnight.
Spot gold was flat at $1,467.60 per ounce .
Oil prices rallied on hopes a trade deal would support global growth and thus demand [O/R]. U.S. crude (CLc1) added 31 cents to $59.49 a barrel, while Brent crude (LCOc1) rose 42 cents to $64.62.

With forecasts pointing to a Conservative majority of 78, the way is now clear for Johnson to pass his EU Withdrawal Bill, formally taking the U.K. out of the bloc after 46 years of membership. He’ll then have a year to negotiate a free-trade deal with the EU before the designated transition period ends.
In the meantime, Johnson has promised a sharp rise in public spending on everything from police to hospitals and schools and renewable energy, a program that, if implemented fully, would represent a major fiscal stimulus.

1672,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 02:41AM ET</span>",Two Chinese cities relax rules to shore up property markets,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Two Chinese cities loosened rules this week to make it easier for individuals to purchase houses or obtain residency, effectively expanding a pool of potential home buyers to prop up moribund residential property markets.
China has clamped down on property speculation since 2016 to contain a market that begun to bubble. But policymakers became increasingly mindful not to sink the market entirely - a pillar for the broader economy - at a time when an economic downturn was underway.
A district in Nanjing, capital of eastern Jiangsu province, said on Friday that among individuals with high education qualifications, diploma holders from vocational institutes are now allowed to buy homes in that area. Previously, only degree holders were eligible.
Separately，Zhengzhou, capital of central Henan province, has introduced a new policy allowing individuals to apply for a residency permit after renting a home for a year, the government-backed newspaper Dahe reported on Thursday. Previously, long-term renters had no such option.
But critics say such relaxation could undermine the central government's efforts to control property speculation, artificially propping up prices.
Chinese top leaders on Thursday reiterated that ""homes are for living, not for speculation"".
""Due to the differences in population size and structures, land resource, housing supply and demand in different places, property policies should be city-based, and can also make appropriate adjustments depending on the effect,"" state-run Economic Daily said in a commentary on Friday.
""But any housing policy should be based on 'homes are for living, not for speculation', not the other way around,"" it warned.
On Wednesday, a city in Jiangsu province abruptly reversed a decision to remove a ban for property resales imposed more than two years ago. The removal of the ban - which lasted for just a day - briefly fanned speculation that more cities could follow suit.
Such policy reversals point to the pressure on local governments to shore up slowing real estate - critical to local government finances - while not appearing to be running counter to the central government's war on speculative buying.

Facebook shares closed 2.7% lower, reflecting fears the potential regulatory move could be a first step toward forcing the company to sell apps WhatsApp and Instagram, its fast-growing acquisitions.
Facebook has plans to allow users of its units Messenger, WhatsApp and the direct messaging system within Instagram to communicate with each other, and end-to-end encryption will be extended across the three services.
A source familiar with the matter said the FTC has not asked Facebook to halt the integration, a step that would normally precede a legal challenge. The Wall Street Journal said the FTC could file for an injunction to halt the integration as early as January.
Apart from antitrust concerns, Facebook and other tech giants are facing criticism over privacy lapses, how they handle vast quantities of consumer data, and accusations of bias in the polarized U.S. political environment.
Facebook and the FTC declined to comment.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced plans in March to integrate Facebook's messaging services as part of a proposed shift toward more private forms of social networking.
Zuckerberg's integration strategy reflects the importance of Instagram and WhatsApp as Facebook's flagship app struggles to attract new young users in the company's most lucrative markets.
Instagram ads drive much of Facebook's revenue growth, while the company is slowly moving toward making money from WhatsApp, which has surged to a user base of 1.5 billion people since its $22 billion acquisition in 2014.
The properties are already integrated to some degree, with users able to link their accounts and advertisers able to use one system to place ads across different platforms.
Encrypting messaging systems will restrict Facebook's ability to see the content of users' messages, but the company has not divulged whether the integration plan may deepen other types of data sharing between the units.
Facebook, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) all face antitrust investigations by the Justice Department and House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.
The FTC was also known to be investigating Facebook while groups of state attorneys general are looking at Facebook and Google.

(Reuters) - A U.S. labor board on Thursday approved McDonald's Corp's proposed settlement allowing the fast-food company to avoid a ruling on whether it is a “joint employer” of franchise workers and could be made to bargain with unions.
The National Labor Relations Board said the settlement, which will bring an end to a sprawling case first brought in 2012, was fair and would provide ""a full remedy"" to workers who claimed they were disciplined or fired for advocating for better working conditions. 
The settlement allows McDonald’s to avoid being held liable when franchisees violate federal labor law.
The workers who brought the case, along with union-backed organizing group Fight for $15, claimed McDonald's disciplined or fired them for participating in nationwide strikes and protests calling for higher wages.
The group, now known as Fight for $15 and a Union, said in a statement that it planned to appeal the decision.
""McDonald's is walking away with a get-out-of-jail-free card after illegally retaliating against low-paid workers who were fighting to be paid enough to feed their families,"" the group said.
Illinois-based McDonald’s said in a statement it was pleased with the decision which ""allows our franchisees and their employees to move forward, and resolves all matters without any admission of wrongdoing."" 
Fight for $15 said the NLRB decision may be invalid because board member William Emanuel, an appointee of President Donald Trump, took part despite his past work at a law firm that advised McDonald's on some of the practices at issue in the case.
McDonald's in the settlement proposed paying between $20 and $50,000 to individual workers. But an NLRB judge last year agreed with Fight for $15 that the proposal was inadequate and lacked important details. 
The NLRB in a 2-1 decision on Thursday said the settlement was reasonable and would allow both sides to avoid more costly litigation in the case.
Business groups have said that a ruling that McDonald’s was a joint employer could upend the franchising model by making franchisors more vulnerable to lawsuits and requiring them to bargain with unions representing franchise workers. The NLRB earlier this year proposed a rule that would make it more difficult to prove that companies are joint employers. 

The International Franchise Association praised Thursday's decision, saying it brings an end to years of uncertainty for franchise businesses.

LONDON (Reuters) - As anti-government demonstrations engulfed Hong Kong in August, Reuters broke a sensitive story: Beijing had rejected a secret proposal by city leader Carrie Lam to meet several of the protesters’ demands in a bid to defuse the unrest.
The story buttressed a main claim of the protesters, that Beijing is intervening deeply in the affairs of the semi-autonomous city. A state-run newspaper denounced the story as “fake” and “shameful.” The article soon became unavailable in mainland China.
It wasn’t the Chinese government that blocked the story. The article was removed by Refinitiv, the financial information provider that distributes Reuters news to investors around the world on Eikon, a trading and analytics platform. The article was one of a growing number of stories that Refinitiv – which until last year was owned by Reuters’ parent company, Thomson Reuters Corp – has censored in mainland China under pressure from the central government.
Since August, Refinitiv has blocked more than 200 stories about the Hong Kong protests plus numerous other Reuters articles that could cast Beijing in an unfavorable light. Internal Refinitiv documents show that over the summer, the company installed an automated filtering system to facilitate the censoring. The system included the creation of a new code to attach to some China stories, called “Restricted News.”
As a result, Refinitiv’s customers in China have been denied access to coverage of one of the biggest news events of the year, including two Reuters reports on downgrades of Hong Kong by credit-rating agencies. Nearly 100 other news providers available on Eikon in China have also been affected by the filtering.
Censorship in China has been intensifying in recent years under President Xi Jinping, and Western businesses have come under rising pressure to block news, speech and products that Beijing sees as politically dangerous. Refinitiv generates tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue in China. As Reuters reported in June, citing three people familiar with the matter, Refinitiv began the censorship effort earlier this year after a regulator threatened to suspend its Chinese operation.
Refinitiv has joined a lengthening list of companies complying with Chinese demands. They include hotel giant Marriott International Inc, which last year temporarily shut down its Chinese websites and apologized for, among other things, listing Taiwan as a separate country in a customer questionnaire. Several U.S. airlines also stopped describing Taiwan as non-Chinese territory on their websites. Beijing considers the self-governed island part of China. The companies have defended their actions.
The censorship has angered the top news and business executives of Reuters and the directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Co Ltd, an independent body tasked with preserving the news agency’s independence.
Speaking to Reuters journalists on a visit to the Singapore newsroom in October, Kim Williams (NYSE:WMB), the Australian media executive who chairs the body, lashed out at Refinitiv, calling its actions “reprehensible” and a capitulation to “naked political aggression” from Beijing. Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler told Reuters journalists in London in November that the censorship was “damaging” the brand. “I don’t approve of it,” he said.
Refinitiv chief executive David Craig and Thomson Reuters CEO Jim Smith have held multiple talks, as recently as this week, in an effort to resolve the issue, said people familiar with the matter. Smith “was very concerned” upon learning about Craig’s decision to impose the filtering, said a senior Thomson Reuters official. It is not clear how close the two are to reaching a solution both sides find agreeable, one of the people said.
“We recognize that the processes that were put in place earlier this year need to be improved and are actively working on enhancements,” Refinitiv spokesman Patrick Meyer said of the filtering system in a statement. “As a global business, Refinitiv must comply with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. This is a challenge that not just Refinitiv faces, but also other companies and distributors of financial market information.”
Refinitiv was formed last year when a consortium led by private equity giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) purchased a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters’ Financial & Risk business, which included the Eikon terminal business, for about $20 billion and rebranded it.
Refinitiv and Thomson Reuters remain close: Reuters sells news to Eikon, and Thomson Reuters retains a 45% stake in Refinitiv. Refinitiv is by far Reuters’ largest client, providing nearly half its revenue. As part of the spin-off deal, Refinitiv agreed to make inflation-adjusted annual payments of $325 million to Reuters over 30 years for news – a reliable income stream that is rare in the media business.
The Founders Share directors are particularly incensed. They have complained to Thomson Reuters CEO Smith that by suppressing stories, Refinitiv is violating the terms of the deal. They also say they fear that Refinitiv, having given in to China’s demands, might start blocking stories in other countries.
Prior to the Blackstone deal, when Thomson Reuters controlled the Eikon business, Reuters stories were not blocked in China on Eikon. The Chinese government itself has been blocking access in China to the Reuters website for general readers, Reuters.com, for years, as well as the sites of many other foreign news organizations.
“Let the Chinese decide if they ban something,” said Pascal Lamy, a Founders Share director and former head of the World Trade Organization. “But this is not Refinitiv’s or Reuters’ decision.” Lamy said the directors believe the terms of the deal require Refinitiv to adhere to Reuters ethical rules on editorial integrity and independence, known as the Trust Principles, which “prevent you from accepting self-censorship.”
In response, Refinitiv said it is “complying with our obligations with respect to the Trust Principles.” It argues that in filtering out political stories for its own customers in China, it is following local laws and regulations as required by its operating license.
Smith, who sits on the boards of both Thomson Reuters and Refinitiv, did not respond to requests for comment. 
The London Stock Exchange has agreed to buy Refinitiv for $27 billion in a deal that’s expected to close in the second half of next year. It declined to comment.
TIANANMEN TABOO
Reuters reported in June that Refinitiv had blocked several Reuters stories under government pressure. The articles were about the 30th anniversary of the bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ). According to the people with knowledge of the matter, Refinitiv acted after the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, which controls online speech, threatened to suspend the company’s service in China if it didn’t comply.
The CAC did not respond to questions about this article. China’s Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.
On June 3, Reuters editor Adler and Michael Friedenberg, president of Reuters, emailed the staff saying they’d expressed concern to Refinitiv.
Refinitiv promised it would alert the newsroom when it came under pressure from Chinese regulators about Reuters coverage. The news agency, as it does when it receives any complaint from individuals and institutions it covers, then would determine if there was any reason to correct a published story. 
In late July, Refinitiv asked Reuters to review an article that detailed how a Chinese government representative in Hong Kong had urged local residents to drive off protesters, just a week before a violent clash broke out between pro- and anti-government crowds in the area. That story, too, was touchy because it showed Beijing intervening in the internal affairs of Hong Kong.
Despite assurances from Reuters that the story was accurate, Refinitiv removed the headline of the story from Eikon in China, making the item difficult for users to find and view. On Aug. 2, Reuters published a story about the blocking of this article as well.
'STRATEGIC CHINA FILTER'
Refinitiv began ramping up its efforts to purge offending China coverage. Internal Refinitiv documents and emails describe how the company over the summer created an automated filtering system - referred to as the “Strategic China filter” - to block certain stories to Eikon users in mainland China.
In July, Refinitiv’s news platform architecture director requested that a new code be created, called “Restricted News,” that could be added to articles. He asked that it “should be hidden for all users (internal and external),” according to notes of a conference call on July 17 where the code was discussed. One reason was that Refinitiv didn’t want to give its mainland China customers the ability to disable the filtering.
In an email to colleagues, the platform director explained the code: “The flag is to highlight news that requires additional processing, due to Chinese govt restrictions, prior to consumption in China.”
The filtering system is designed to block stories for readers in mainland China but allow them to be accessed in other markets. It looks for restricted keywords in headlines, such as “Hong Kong” and “protest,” according to a person familiar with the matter.
Refinitiv employees also discussed by email whether the “Restricted News” code should be China-specific or “generic,” so it could be used to block stories in other countries in the future. The email exchange indicates they opted for a generic code. Reuters found no evidence that Refinitiv has deployed the filtering system in other nations. Refinitiv didn’t comment on whether it plans to use the restriction code elsewhere.
Eikon users outside mainland China can retrieve stories about the Hong Kong protests by clicking on headlines, or by searching for keywords or codes. For users inside China, however, articles that are blocked bring up this message: “You do not have access to this story.”
Refinitiv’s blocking of protest stories intensified after Aug. 30, when Reuters reported that Beijing had rejected a bid by Hong Kong leader Lam to compromise with the protesters. Before that date, all but five of 246 Reuters articles that had run in 2019 containing the words “Hong Kong” and “protest” in the headline were accessible on the mainland. By contrast, between Aug. 30 and Nov. 20, Refinitiv blocked nearly four out of five such articles that Reuters filed – 196 out of 251.
The censorship was especially severe between Sept. 4 and Oct. 7, when all 104 Reuters articles containing those words in the headline were blocked. At the time, demonstrators were rampaging across the city and police were responding with water cannons and rubber bullets.
Refinitiv also censored potentially market-moving stories that would have been of interest to Refinitiv’s core clientele of financial professionals. These included a Sept. 6 report that Fitch Ratings had downgraded Hong Kong’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating. Also blocked were stories on the effect of the protests on stock prices and initial public offerings.
Refinitiv eventually began having employees get involved in the filtering process to prevent the blocking of financial stories, according to a person familiar with the matter. Yet the filtering remains inconsistent.
It lets through some stories that China might consider politically taboo, including some articles about the Chinese government’s mass incarceration of Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic minority in western China. Many other articles on the Uighurs have been blocked.
Besides Reuters articles, the filtering has also blocked one or more stories from 97 other news providers that are available inside China on the Eikon system – including Xinhua, China’s official state-run news agency. 
On Dec. 3, Refinitiv blocked a Xinhua story about a small demonstration in Hong Kong by pro-Beijing residents. They were quoted heatedly denouncing Washington over a new U.S. law that supports Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters.

And news relevant to investors is still being censored. Eikon users in mainland China couldn’t read this story shortly after it was published. It was blocked.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 09:22PM ET</span>",Airbus beats Boeing to become preferred supplier for Qantas Sydney-London flights,"By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) said on Friday it has chosen Airbus SE (PA:AIR) as preferred supplier for jets capable of the world's longest commercial flights from Sydney to London, beating rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA) after a hard-fought contest.
The choice of up to 12 A350-1000 planes fitted with an extra fuel tank for flights of up to 21 hours cements Airbus as the leader in ultra-long haul flying globally at a time when Boeing is battling delays on its rival 777X program and a broader corporate crisis following two deadly 737 MAX crashes. 
The Qantas flights would begin in the first half of 2023, but remain subject to reaching a pay deal with pilots, who would need to extend their duty times to around 23 hours to account for potential delays and switch between flying the A350 and the airline's current A330 fleet. A final decision on an order is expected in March, the airline said.
Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said the airline ""had a lot of confidence"" in the market for non-stop services from Sydney to London and to New York based on two years of flying non-stop from Perth to London, where it has achieved a 30% fare premium over one-stop rivals in premium classes.
""The A350 is a fantastic aircraft and the deal on the table with Airbus gives us the best possible combination of commercial terms, fuel efficiency, operating cost and customer experience,"" he said.
Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) operates the world's current longest flight, nearly 19 hours from Singapore to New York, using an ultra-long range version of the smaller A350-900.
Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer thanked Qantas for its selection in a statement, while a Boeing spokesman said it was disappointed with the decision but looked forward to continuing its longstanding partnership with the airline.
Rico Merkert, a transport professor at the University of Sydney Business School, said the A350-1000 fit the Qantas brief well and was the safer choice, given Boeing has recently reported problems such as the grounding of the 737 MAX, structural cracks in 737 NGs and a fuselage split in a stress test of its 777-9.
""The A350 just seems to be a much safer bet,"" he said. ""And safety is at the core of everything that Qantas does including its brand.""
Airbus no longer provides list prices for aircraft, but based on its 2018 price list, the Qantas order could be worth up to $4.4 billion before heavy discounts that are standard for airline customers.
Citi on Friday estimated the planes would cost A$3 billion ($2.04 billion) to $3.5 billion, with the investment likely to be phased over three years.
The selection of the A350-1000 will add to growing doubts over Boeing's plans to produce the 777-8 that it had proposed to Qantas for the mission.
Boeing had already said the entry into service for the plane, a smaller, longer-range version of the 777-9, would be delayed beyond 2022 but has declined to give a new date, saying it would be based on customer demand.
Customers Emirates and Qatar Airways have indicated they could switch orders for the 777-8 to the 777-9.
The 777-9 is due to enter service in 2021, following delays associated with its GE (N:GE) engines.
The Boeing spokesman said on Friday the manufacturer was focused on the development of the 777-9 and after that it would complete development of the 777-8, with the first delivery scheduled a few years after that.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 09:11PM ET</span>",Cboe exchange files to list new short volatility ETF,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cboe BZX Exchange has sought permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to list shares of an exchange traded fund that would let investors bet against stock market gyrations, according to a regulatory filing.
The filing, dated Dec. 10, comes nearly two years after another short volatility exchange traded product, the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN, popularly called 'XIV', collapsed leading to billions of dollars in losses for investors.
The Cboe BZX Exchange ETF is designed to track the daily move in the Short VIX Futures index index, which itself measures a rolling positioning in the first and second month contracts on the Cboe VIX futures (VXc1) , the filing said.
Owning the ETF's share would essentially be a bet on stock market calm. Cboe BZX Exchange is operated by Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE).
U.S. stocks have risen sharply this year even as daily stock moves have remained muted, drawing interest from investors looking to make money from bets that the calm in equity markets will persist.
Exchange traded products (ETPs) that try to track stock market volatility have seen massive adoption since they were first introduced in 2009. These ETPs offer investors stock-like access to financial strategies that would be typically out of reach for retail investors.
In recent years, investors have poured billions of dollars into ETPs, such as the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (P:VXX) and the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (O:TVIX).
VXX and TVIX, together have about $2 billion in assets, according to the fund's website.
Since these products are designed to rise when stocks fall, they provide investors with a way to guard against a hit to equity markets.
The popularity of these ETPs led to the launch of other ETFs that sought to provide inverse returns to stock market volatility.
An extended period of stock market calm in 2016-2017 boosted the returns for these inverse ETPs with assets in XIV - the most popular of these products - growing to about $2 billion.
These products drew criticism when a sudden drop in the U.S. stock market in February 2018 wiped out most of the value of these ETPs and led to the collapse of some products, including XIV.
Demand for shorting volatility remains strong and the demise of XIV has led some investors to take to shorting long volatility ETPs as a way to bet against volatility.
Volatility Shares LLC will serve as sponsor for Cboe proposed ETF, while Tidal ETF Services LLC will serve as its administrator."
1684,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 07:01PM ET</span>",Australia's CBA to pay $17 million to underpaid workers,"(Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) on Friday said it would pay an additional A$25 million ($16.97 million) to current and former employees who were found in a review to have been underpaid, and its chief executive apologized for ""past errors.""
""To date, CBA has notified or repaid approximately 41,000 current and former employees with A$13.2 million of back-pay plus interest. CBA will commence payments of a further A$14.9 million plus interest next week,"" CBA said in an exchange filing.
The remaining money will be paid at the completion of the review this fiscal year.
""It is unacceptable that some of our people were not paid the correct entitlements. This should never have happened
and I apologize to anyone impacted by these past errors,"" said Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn in a statement.
The admission further soured the bank's standing with Australians after the powerful Royal Commission, which submitted its report earlier this year, exposed wrongdoings in the finance sector.
The CBA becomes the latest company to admit it underpaid workers, after the country's biggest grocery chain Woolworths Group (AX:WOW) in October said it underpaid thousands of supermarket workers for years and would need to repay as much as A$300 million.
Other cases of staff underpayment have included retail conglomerate Wesfarmers (AX:WES), Super Retail Group (AX:SUL), and jeweller  Michael Hill International Ltd  (AX:MHJ) among others.
In the review that started in early 2018, CBA examined pay and a broad range of entitlements for current and former full-time, part-time and casual employees.
In February, CBA self-reported the review to the Fair Work Ombudsman, who is conducting an investigation into the matter."
1685,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 06:17PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for Dec. 13,"Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Trade Deal Fallout
Wall Street jumped today following the reports of the U.S. and China agreeing to a phase one trade deal, but the follow-up reports that President Donald Trump had signed off on it came after the close of trading.
That could mean further follow-through for U.S. equities tomorrow as details (and more speculation) emerge. Asia was set to jump at the start of trading with Nikkei futures up 1%.
European shares could also be more active as the Trump Administration appears to be anxious to wrap up at least partial deals on trade battles it initiated.
The dollar will also be active as the trade deal comes into focus. A legal text hasn’t been finalized.
China will buy more U.S. agricultural goods and there will be discussion about reducing tariffs on Chinese goods by as much as half, Bloomberg reported.
China’s subsidies of areas of its economy will be put off for a later time, but intellectual property will be part of it, Bloomberg said.
2. Trade Sights on Sterling
Exit polls in the U.K. general election point to a landslide victory for the ruling Conservative party, paving the way for Prime Minister Borish Johnson's Brexit deal.
GBP/USD surged 2.1% shortly after the polls came out. EUR/GBP was off 1.75%.
The Conservatives are predicted to win 368 seats, with opposition Labour taking 191 seats, the Scottish National Party with 55 seats and the Liberal Democrats winning 13 seats.
That would be the highest number of Tory seats since 1987 and the lowest number of Labour seats since 1935.
Expect Brexit sensitive stocks in both London and the European exchanges to see increased vollume.
3. Retail Sales Eyed 
The Commerce Department is due to release figures on November retail sales. And many are keen to see whether the U.S. consumer remains in good shape, with the holiday season, a crucial period for retailers, now in full swing.
On average, economists expect that retail sales rose 0.5% last month and that core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, rose 0.4%.
The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP – is expected to again rise 0.3%, the same as the month before."

The S&P 500 closed up 0.9% at 3,168.57, breaking the old closing high of 3,153.63, set on Nov. 27. It also hit a new intraday high of 3,176.28. The Nasdaq finished up 0.73% to 8,717.32, after hitting an intraday high of 8,745.82. Both closes broke their old records set on Nov. 27.

A final text hadn't been approved.
President Donald Trump tweeted early in the day a deal was near, and stocks took off at the open, with the Dow rising as many as 314 points. The market pulled back, cutting the gains by more than half, and then moved higher as more reports of a deal were published. Bloomberg News said late Thursday Trump has signed off on the deal.

Instead, the company will follow the lead of the Federal Aviation Administration. FAA administrator Stephen Dickson said Wednesday the approval would not come until next year – and wouldn't put a specific date.
The other decliners were 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) and Procter & Gamble(NYSE:PG).
Bank stocks overall were higher independent of the trade question, with the KBW Bank index rising 2.9%. Helping the group was the New York Federal Reserve Bank's announcement Thursday it will conduct repurchase agreement operations totaling $365 billion to ensure banks have enough liquidity.
That came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's commitment on Wednesday to support the repo market, the lifeblood of banking operations, at least through January. Banks and financial institutions routinely buy and sell securities on a short-term basis to fund their needs. 
 
 
Oil prices and interest rates moved higher.

The 10-Year Treasury yield rose to 1.897% from Wednesday's 1.79%.
Gold fell $2.70 to $1,472.30 an ounce in New York, a reflection of declining trade tensions. 
Casino operator Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), which has big operations in Macau, chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and fashion retailers L Brands (NYSE:LB) and Gap (NYSE:GPS) were among the top S&P 500 performers.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 04:58PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing delays plans for record 737 production until 2021 - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has delayed plans to reach a record production rate of 57 737 jets per month next year, industry sources said on Thursday, even before the U.S. FAA announced a new delay in the 737 MAX's return to service which raised uncertainty over production plans.
The world's largest planemaker has also delayed plans to step up from the current rate of 42 jets per month to 46 jets this year until March 2020, as the company struggles to win regulatory approvals for its best-selling jet after two deadly crashes.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday that the agency will not approve the grounded commercial jet for flight before year end, and said it was investigating production issues at the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington.
FAA chief Steve Dickson, who met with Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg on Thursday, is concerned that the U.S. airplane maker is pursuing a 737 MAX return-to-service schedule that is ""not realistic,"" according to an email seen by Reuters.
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the company's specific production plans. He said Boeing would continue to assess production decisions based on the timing and conditions of the 737 MAX's return to service, which will be based on regulatory approvals and may vary by jurisdiction.
In October, Muilenburg told analysts that Boeing expects to be able to maintain its current monthly production rate of 42 aircraft, followed by incremental rate increases that would bring the production rate to 57 in late 2020. 
Industry sources said this plan has been delayed by months.
After getting to 47 jets monthly in March 2020, Boeing will make its next increase to 52 jets per month in September 2020, according to one person familiar with the plans. It will then not reach a record stride of 57 per month until April 2021, the person and a second industry source said.
A third industry source confirmed the general timeline but cautioned the plan could be further delayed by the 737 MAX approval process.
Boeing mainly builds the latest version of its cash-cow single-aisle family at its Seattle-area factory, but also builds a small number of earlier or military variants of the 737. 
In April, Boeing cut the number of 737s it produces monthly to 42 from 52 after halting deliveries to airline customers, cutting off a key source of cash and hitting margins. 

Because the grounding happened when Boeing was going up toward record production levels, and each move of the sprawling supply chain has to be planned far in advance, Boeing and its suppliers are now caught between two conflicting pressures: preparing to get back on the upward path as soon as the 737 MAX is flying but also ratcheting downwards if regulators stall and the grounding continues for longer than expected.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) on Thursday abandoned its goal of winning approval this month from the Federal Aviation Administration to unground the 737 MAX after Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg met with senior U.S. aviation officials.
The announcement came after a congressional hearing on Wednesday in which numerous lawmakers prodded the FAA to take a tougher line with Boeing as it continues to review the plane that has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people. 
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said on Wednesday he would not clear the plane to fly before 2020 and disclosed the agency has an ongoing investigation into 737 production issues in Renton, Washington. He added there are nearly a dozen milestones that must be completed before the MAX returns to service. Approval is not likely until at least February and could be delayed until March, U.S. officials told Reuters.
Muilenburg and Boeing's commercial airplanes chief, Stan Deal, met with Dickson and ""committed to addressing all of the FAA’s questions,"" the company said, adding it will work to support the agency's ""requirements and their timeline as we work to safely return the Max to service in 2020.""
Dickson told Muilenburg, according to an email sent to lawmakers by the FAA, that ""Boeing’s focus should be on the quality and timeliness of data submittals for FAA review. He made clear that FAA’s certification requirements must be 100% complete before return to service.""
Boeing had said last month it expected the FAA would allow it to resume 737 MAX deliveries in December.
The company previously warned a significant delay in MAX approval could force it to cut or halt production of the aircraft, a move that would have repercussions across its global supply chain. 
Boeing's shares closed 1.1% lower at $346.29 on Thursday.
Separately,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) said on Thursday it was extending cancellations of 737 MAX flights through April 6. American, the largest U.S. airline, had previously canceled about 140 flights a day through March 4 and now expects to resume 737 MAX passenger flights on April 7.
Gary Kelly, the CEO of Boeing’s largest 737 MAX customer, Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), said he was ""concerned"" about what Boeing decides to do with its production line. Southwest was supposed to have 75 MAX jets in service this year and, like other airlines, it has had to cancel routes and scale back growth plans as it operates a slimmer fleet.
Kelly said it is ""likely"" the airline will again need to push back its restart date from March.
In an email to congressional staff earlier on Thursday disclosing the meeting between Dickson and Muilenburg, FAA official Philip Newman said Dickson is ""concerned that Boeing continues to pursue a return-to-service schedule that is not realistic due to delays that have accumulated for a variety of reasons. More concerning, the administrator wants to directly address the perception that some of Boeing’s public statements have been designed to force FAA into taking quicker action.""

1690,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 04:51PM ET</span>",Trump Signs Off U.S.-China Trade Deal to Avert December Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
President Donald Trump signed off on a so-called phase-one trade deal with China, averting the Dec. 15 introduction of a new wave of U.S. tariffs on about $160 billion of consumer goods from the Asian nation, according to people familiar with the matter.
The deal presented to Trump by trade advisers Thursday included a promise by the Chinese to buy more U.S. agricultural goods, according to the people. Officials also discussed possible reductions of existing duties on Chinese products, they said. The terms have been agreed but the legal text has not yet been finalized, the people said. A White House spokesperson declined to comment.
The administration has reached out to allies on Capitol Hill and in the business community to issue statements of support once the announcement is made, they said.
U.S. stocks rose to records earlier Thursday as optimism grew that there would be a deal. Trump tweeted that the U.S. and China are “VERY close” to signing a “BIG” trade deal, also sending equities higher.
“They want it, and so do we!” he tweeted five minutes after equity markets opened in New York, sending stocks to new records.
Trump has rejected deals with China before. Negotiators have been working on the terms of the phase-one deal for months after the president announced in October that the two nations had reached an agreement that could be put on paper within weeks.
The U.S. has added a 25% duty on about $250 billion of Chinese products and a 15% levy on another $110 billion of its imports over the course of a roughly 20-month trade war. Discussions now are focused on reducing those rates by as much as half, as part of the interim agreement Trump announced almost nine weeks ago.
In addition to a significant increase in Chinese agricultural purchases in exchange for tariff relief, officials have also said a phase-one pact would include Chinese commitments to do more to stop intellectual-property theft and an agreement by both sides not to manipulate their currencies.
Put off for later discussions are knotty issues such as longstanding U.S. complaints over the vast web of subsidies ranging from cheap electricity to low-cost loans that China has used to build its industrial might.
Officials from the world’s two biggest economies have been locked in negotiations on the phase-one deal since Trump announced it.
The new duties, which were scheduled to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Washington time on Sunday unless the administration says otherwise, would hit consumer goods from China including smartphones and toys.
Before today, Trump’s advisers have sent conflicting signals and stressed that he hadn’t made up his mind on the next steps. Advocates of delaying the tariff increase have argued that continued negotiations with Beijing will enable him to maintain a tough line with China without inflicting the economic damage that more import taxes might bring.
The decision facing Trump highlights one dilemma he confronts going into the 2020 election: Whether to bet on an escalation of hostilities with China and the tariffs he is so fond of or to follow the advice of more market-oriented advisers and business leaders who argue a pause in the escalation would help a slowing U.S. economy bounce back in an election year.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“The outcome of U.S.-China trade talks will be a key determinant of the trajectory for 2020 growth. At one extreme, a deal that takes tariffs back to May 2019 levels, and provides certainty that the truce will hold, could deliver a 0.6% boost to global GDP. At the other, a breakdown in talks would mean the trade drag extends into the year ahead.”--Tom Orlik, chief economistFor the full report, click here
Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative leading the negotiations with China, is in a camp that sees progress in talks and wants them to continue without further escalation, according to people familiar with the discussions. That would set up a push to conclude the talks in January, possibly before a State of the Union address to Congress by Trump."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said on Thursday it committed an initial $130 million to fund an independent oversight board, but said it would not announce its members this year, as originally expected.
The board will be able to make final decisions on whether individual pieces of content - such as a sensitive video or ad - should be displayed on the site, even over-ruling Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg.
The board is one of Facebook's high-profile efforts to respond to criticism over how it handles problematic content and transparency around its decision-making. It also released an assessment on the human rights impacts of content decisions by the board. 
However, the board's creation is behind schedule, the company confirmed in a blog post. Facebook will probably not name the board's co-chairs and first members until after January 2020. 
Brent Harris, Facebook's head of governance and global affairs, said the delays were due to both the unforeseen complexities of creating a trust to ensure the board's independence and to the task of reducing more than 1,000 nominees to no more than about 40. 
""This is not a 'move fast and break things' project,"" Harris told Reuters by telephone, referring to the social media network's early motto.
He said the recommended members had come through Facebook's global consultation process in 88 countries, as well as the company's public online portal, which opened in September. 
They range from ""former heads of state to Nobel Prize winners to people who moderate groups on Facebook to local judges,"" Harris said.
Facebook plans to announce the board's co-chairs, likely to number three, he said, and a first set of about 20 members after January. 
Both Facebook and its users can submit cases to the board, and while it cannot make policy, Facebook will be required to respond publicly to any recommendations. 
""The board is an actual institution; it's almost like its own start-up and it needs all the things that new institutions need"" such as a legal team and recruiting mechanisms, said Heather Moore, a member of the Facebook team who developed the board's charter.
The social media giant said the $130 million should cover operational costs for at least six years. 
Kate Klonick, an assistant law professor at St. John’s University whom Facebook allowed to observe the process of establishing the board, said that while she was disappointed by the timeline, the scale of funding was positive. 
""The fact they announced this commitment of money is an enormous sign of how important it’s going to be,"" Klonick told Reuters.

The departure was announced via a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) post titled ""A Love Letter to Walmart."" He did not provide details on his future plans or his last day at the company.
Dunn, currently the senior vice-president of digital consumer brands at Walmart U.S. eCommerce, became part of the company's efforts to take on Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and other online sellers when the big-box retailer acquired Bonobos for $310 million in June 2017.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 04:06PM ET</span>","Explainer: Why are banks watching Australia cartel case involving JP Morgan, Citi & Deutsche?","By Alun John and Byron Kaye
HONG KONG/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Investment bankers the world over are paying close attention to court hearings in Sydney in a landmark legal case that alleges cartel activity by  Citigroup  and  Deutsche Bank  employees, with JPMorgan witnesses appearing for the prosecution.
Many fear the proceedings could lead to increased scrutiny and tougher measures from regulators worldwide.
Australian authorities filed criminal charges in June 2018 against the local units of Citigroup (N:C), Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and six bankers over a A$2.5 billion stock sale.
JPMorgan (N:JPM), which also advised on the 2015 deal, has been collaborating with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission(ACCC) since as early as March 2016 in return for immunity from prosecution, a pre-trial hearing heard last week.
The banks and their executives have yet to enter formal pleas but have said they will defend the case.
They have declined to comment further on the matter outside of court hearings.
Pre-trial hearings have been underway in recent months and appear likely to continue into 2020. No trial date has been set.
WHAT ARE THE CHARGES?
The charges stem from the August 2015 sale of $2.3 billion of new ANZ shares and the subsequent trading of some of the shares by two of the underwriters - Deutsche Bank and Citigroup.
The banks failed to sell all the shares to investors and so purchased some themselves.
Prosecutors say the banks struck an agreement to keep the unsold shares secret to support the share price, and, in doing so, formed a criminal cartel.
Charges have also been brought against six former or current executives at the banks, three from Citi, two from Deutsche and one from ANZ.
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
For investment banks, the case will set a precedent in an area of financial markets activity that lacks clear rules and has never been tested in the courts.
""Underwriting syndicates exist to provide the capacity to assume risk and to underwrite large capital raisings, and have operated successfully in Australia in this manner for decades,"" Citi said when the case was first made public.
Bankers outside Australia fear a successful prosecution could prompt regulators elsewhere to take a fresh look at share sale practices.
Cartel charges in Australia carry a maximum penalty of three times the profit made from the cartel activity or 10 percent of a firm's revenue. Penalties for individuals found guilty carry fines or a maximum 10-year jail term.
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNT FROM DECEMBER'S PRE-TRIAL HEARINGS?
Representatives for the banks and their executives have cross-examined certain prosecution witnesses, including JPMorgan bankers.
JPMorgan former markets head, Jeff Herbert-Smith, said that in his view the banks had not colluded, a position apparently at odds with the prosecution's case.
JPMorgan's former head of equity capital markets, Richard Galvin, said he received a ""letter of comfort"" from the ACCC, as long ago as in June 2016, assuring him immunity if he co-operated with their investigation into the capital raising.
OTHER AUSTRALIAN BANKING SCANDALS?
This is one of many incidents to jolt Australia's banks over the past two years, including a year-long public inquiry which leveled blistering criticism at the sector.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has sued ANZ over the same share placement.
Last month financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC accused Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) of 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws, saying the banking giant ignored red flags and for years enabled payments from convicted child sex offenders and ""high risk"" countries.
Westpac's chief executive and compliance head have stepped down.
Previously, National Australia Bank's (AX:NAB) chairman and CEO, and the CEO and chairwoman of the country’s biggest financial planner, AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), were forced to step down in connection with problems uncovered by a public inquiry."
